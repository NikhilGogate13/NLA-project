dispute was over whether the US should join the League of Nations or not.
strongly opposed this while President Wilson was a strong supporter in favor of it.
question led to debate in many states but none was so affected as Missouri.
the dispute was over president Wilson's will to form a strong national leadership, while Reed wanted more state control.
it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.
supporters for the President mainly resided in the more rural parts of the state.
contributing to the change was the Republicans inability to handle the Great Depression.
state of Missouri hasn't seen such high growth in population during the past decades as other states.

The MEF has categorized its program activities in four major fields.
species grows to a maximum known length of 117 cm and a weight of 43.5 kg, however is rare above 80 cm.
trevally are easily recognised by their electric blue fins, tapered snout and numerous blue and black spots on their sides.
lack these obvious colours, and must be identified by more detailed anatomical features such as fin ray and scute counts.
prefer shallower, protected waters, even entering estuaries for short periods in some locations.
consume a higher amount of small crustaceans, but transfer to a more fish based diet as they grow.
bluefin trevally is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fishermen.
its popularity as a table fish, many cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species.
bluefin trevally is classified within the genus "Caranx", one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies.
name's specific epithet is derived from the Latin translation of "black spotted".
confusion culminated in Yojiro Wakiya concluding in 1924 they should be treated as separate species.
ICZN nomenclature rules, these later names are deemed junior synonyms of "C. melampygus" and rendered invalid.
species has not been included in any detailed phylogenetic studies of the Carangidae.
include bluefin jack, bluefin kingfish, blue ulua, omilu, bluefinned crevalle and spotted trevally.
species has many other non-English names due to its wide distribution.
slight convexity leads to the species having a much more pointed snout than most other members of "Caranx".
anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 17 to 20 soft rays.
caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head.
species has 25 to 29 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present.
their wide range, the only geographical variation in the species is the depth of the body in smaller specimens.
Most species have very small geographical ranges and are uncommon locally.
species takes its name from the colour of its dorsal, anal and caudal fins, which are a diagnostic electric blue.
pelvic and pectoral fins are white, with the pectoral fin having a yellow tinge.
fish do not have the bright blue fins, instead have dark fins with the exception of a yellow pectoral fin.
juvenile fish have also been recorded as having up to five dark vertical bars on their sides.
southernmost record from the west coast of Australia comes from Exmouth Gulf.
continental Asia, the species has been recorded from Malaysia to Vietnam and mainland China.
offshore range does extend north to Hong Kong, Taiwan and southern Japan in the north western Pacific.
the south, the species reaches as far south as Sydney in Australia.
distribution continues throughout the western Pacific including Tonga, Western Samoa and Polynesia, and the Hawaiian Islands.
bluefin trevally occurs in a wide range of inshore and offshore marine settings throughout its range, including estuarine waters.
estuaries are often lined by mudflats and mangroves, however the species rarely enters these shallow waters.
trevally can tolerate salinities of between 6.0 and 35‰, and only occupy clear, low turbidity waters.
is evidence the species is only resident in these estuaries for short periods.
species is also absent from coastal lakes that many other carangids are known from.
is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae and to a lesser extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae.
fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do.
reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species.
bluefin trevally is a fast swimming, mainly piscivorous predator which shows a wide range in hunting techniques.
species appears to have a preference for fish of a specific size, which depends on its own length and age.
fish are able to effectively filter these small crustaceans from the water, while adults are not.
some cases, only one individual in a group will attack the prey school.
suggesting some mechanical advantage is gained when hunting in this mode.
dark fish in ambush mode vigorously drive away any other bluefin trevally that stray too close to the aggregation.
have also been observed on small midwater planktivorous fishes are moving to or from the shelter of the reef.
many cases, the species uses changes in the depth of the reef such as ledges to conceal its ambush attacks.
bluefin trevally reaches sexual maturity at between 30 and 40 cm in length and around 2 years in age,
one study Hawaii suggesting maturation occurs at a length of around 35 cm on average.
events are often clustered in a few consecutive or alternate days, usually in the third or fourth lunar phases.
in captive fish show females may produce over 6 000 000 eggs per year.
eggs are pelagic and spherical, with diameters between 0.72 and 0.79 mm.
from juveniles in Hawaii indicate the fish is around 70 mm by 100 days and 130 mm by 200 days.
reaches 75 cm by 8 years of age and 85 cm by 12 years.
fish move from these shallower inshore waters to deeper reefs as they grow.
were initially identified as hybrids by intermediate physical characteristics, and were later confiremed by DNA sequencing.
has been suggested these hybrids resulted from mixed species schooling during spawning periods.
this region, catch levels have fluctuated between 2 and 50 tonnes in the past decade.
bluefin trevally sold in Hawaii are now imported from other Indo-Pacific nations.
is usually sold fresh, as well as frozen or salted.
rapid decline in the population has seen a focus on breeding the bluefin trevally in captivity.
investigations into the potential for offshore aquaculture were conducted in Hawaii, where the species successfully spawned in captivity.
only barrier in these studies to successful production was problems with commercial food items.
fish makes long powerful runs on light tackle, and is a determined fighter.
may include poppers, plugs, spoons, jigs, soft plastic lures and even saltwater flies.
species inshore habits make it a popular target for spearfishermen also.
Hawaii the species has bag and size limit restrictions in place to prevent further overexploitation.
risk of poisoning has also affected the sales of the fish in the marketplace in recent years.
of concern is one report of infection by a dracunculoid parasite while preparing the fish for eating.
bluefin trevally has been successfully kept in large saltwater aquaria, but require large water volumes to adapt well.
slaughter is the killing of nonhuman animals, usually referring to killing domestic livestock.
use of a sharpened blade for the slaughtering of livestock has been practiced throughout history.
early as 1853, he designed a chamber that could kill animals by gassing them.
development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century.
the second half of the twentieth century, Thai elections seemed to alternate with military coups.
course, the second half of the twentieth century was far from perfect.
HSA went on to play a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933.
made the mechanical stunning of cows and electrical stunning of pigs compulsory, with the exception of Jewish and Muslim meat.
methods, such as the captive bolt pistol and electric tongs were required and the Act's wording specifically outlawed the poleaxe.

IPD, project participants can overcome key organizational and contractual problems.
IPD approach to contracting aligns project objectives with the interests of key participants.
consumers might consider rethinking their contracting strategies to share more fully in the benefits.
IPD approach creates an organization with the ability to apply Lean Project Delivery (LPD) principles and practices.
are at least five principal forms of contract that support lean construction
Lean Project Delivery (ILPD) is a process trademarked by The Boldt Group.

begins with collaborative scheduling/programming engaging the main project suppliers from the start.
analysis ensures that float is built in where it will best protect programme integrity and predictability.
appropriate the process can be used for "programme compression" too.
this way, one constructor took 6 weeks out of an 18-week programme for the construction of a 40 bed hotel.
work starts, team leaders make tasks ready so that when work should be done, it can be.
2: part of a MakeReady form for documenting the process of making tasks ready (this one for use in design)
is in everyone’s interest to explore inter-dependencies between tasks and prevent colleagues from over-committing.
agreed programme defines when tasks "should" be done and acts as a request to the supplier to do that task.
key measure of the success of the Last Planner system is PPC.
productivity and profitability increase, with step changes at around 70% and 85%.
Planner benefits don’t stop at project predictability, profit and productivity; it contributes to positive changes in other industry KPIs.
more information about the development process see Ballard (1994, 2000) and Ballard and Howell (2004) for example.
are many differences between the Lean Construction (LC) approach and the Project Management Institute (PMI) approach to construction.

other outside forces have played a large role in the nation's educational development.
First Opium War of 1840, for example, opened China to the rest of the world.
a result, Chinese intellectuals discovered the numerous western advances in science and technology.
new information greatly impacted the higher education system and curriculum.
influence in the early 1950s brought all higher education under government leadership.
government also introduced a central plan for a nationally unified instruction system, i.e.
higher education continues its struggle with excessive departmentalisation, segmentation, and overspecialisation in particular.
enrollment of postsecondary students can be used as example to illustrate the impacts.
has had a major impact on education in the 21st century.
the 1980s on, Chinese higher education has undergone a series of reforms that have slowly brought improvement.
government found that schools lacked the flexibility and autonomy to provide education according to the needs of the society.
while government policies, according to this school, are ineffective, that matters little.
reforms aim to provide higher education institutions more autonomy and the ability to better meet the needs of students.
2002, there were slightly over 2000 higher education institutions in PRC.
little more than 600 were higher education institutions for adults.
enrollment increased to 15 million, with rapid growth that is expected to peak in 2008.
the higher education system does not meet the needs of 85 percent of the college-aged population.
1998, 10 universities have been targeted by the Chinese government to become“world-class”- including Peking and Tsinghua Universities.
2007, China has become the sixth largest country in hosting international students.
top ten countries with students studying in China include: Korea, Japan, USA, Vietnam, Thailand, Russia, India, Indonesia, France and Pakistan.
total number of international students studying in China often range around two hundred thousands.
is a consequence of the lack of an academic degree system in China until the 1980s.
Spring 2007 China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities.
results of this evaluation would be used to support the next major planned policy initiative.

education development imbalance leads to the different treatment of students from different regions.
HEIs is the cornerstone in China’s higher education, while private universities development could not be ignored.
HEIs are likely to receive more policy and finance support from official level.
with state-owned universities, private universities'development is in an awkward position.
to the large population, Chinese public universities are impossible to satisfy everyone’s needs.
source of funds for them depends largely on students'tuition fees
achieve success, the state realizes that the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on education must be reversed.
this end, top universities now function as centers of excellence that serve as a model for all other institutes.
helpful model involved "twinning" of poorer institutes with model institutes to provide equipment, curricula, and faculty development.
is growing concern about the mindset of students produced by Chinese institutions, where cheating is widespread and tolerated.
issues will need to be addressed in the coming years if China aims to continue its drive for excellence.
of expansion of universities in China last decades, more students had access to receive higher education.
continuous graduates'entry into employment market, graduate unemployment is highlighted.
individual country, the top three countries of origins are South Korea(62,923), United States(24203) and Thailand(21296).
10% of foreign students receive Chinese Government Scholarship and the rest 90% are self-funded.
the other side, more Chinese wealthy families are more likely to send their kids abroad to receive higher education.
students have been the largest foreign group in USA since 2010, with 157,588 arriving between 2010 and 2011.
education will likely remain the leading choice for Chinese students due to its cross-disciplinary fields and development of critical thinking.

Hong Kong, and other Asian countries are already making strides into this market.
can be economically salubrious, either if the scholars choose to stay in the host country or return to the mainland.
Chinese students who go abroad are among the best and brightest from their home country.
with commonwealth countries'tuition, tuition of China’s higher education is relatively inexpensive.
seldom has the news that some college students discontinue studies because of lacking of tuition or living cost.
total number of 985 project is 39 and all of them belong to 211 project at the same time.
initial aim is to promote China’s educational competitiveness and establishment of a number of leading disciplines in the world.
the project, it is not only a glory but also hints numerous tangible benefits.
majority of public universities'development lies to all levels of government funds.
in this project means you will gain more research funds.
financial support from government level, in most circumstances, decides one university’s development.
imbalanced distribution of scientific research funds will deepen the gap among universities.

Anne Vondeling prize is given annually to journalists who write in a clear manner concerning political subjects.
teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a rare tumor usually diagnosed in childhood.
usually a brain tumor, AT/RT can occur anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS) including the spinal cord.
60% will be in the posterior cranial fossa (particularly the cerebellum).
review estimated 52% posterior fossa, 39% sPNET (supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors), 5% pineal, 2% spinal, and 2% multi-focal.
the United States, three children per 1,000,000 or around 30 new AT/RT cases are diagnosed each year.
17% of all pediatric cancers involve the CNS; it is the most common childhood solid tumor.
brain cancer is the second leading cause of childhood death, just after leukemia.
trends suggest that the rate of overall CNS tumor diagnosis is increasing by about 2.7% per year.
diagnostic techniques using genetic markers improve and are used more often, the proportion of AT/RT diagnoses is expected to increase.
relatively recent classification and rarity has contributed to initial misdiagnosis and non-optimal therapy.
research is focusing on using chemotherapy protocols that are effective against rhabdomyosarcoma in combination with surgery and radiation therapy.
studies using multi-modal therapy have shown significantly improved survival data.
rates can be significantly improved when the correct genetic diagnosis is made at the outset, followed with specific multi-modal treatment.
may be related to malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), which occurs outside the CNS, usually in the kidney.
and MRT also have similar histology and similar clinical and demographic features.
10–15% of MRT patients have simultaneous or subsequent brain tumors, many of which are secondary or primary MRT.
signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor.
particular the chromosomal 22 deletion is very common in AT/RTs.
chromosome 22 area contains the hSNF5/INI1 gene that appears to function as a classic tumor suppressor gene.
rhabdoid tumors have INI1 deletions whether they occur in the CNS, kidney or elsewhere.
mutation is viewed as the "first hit" which predisposes children to malignancies.
a component of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, is a critical tumor suppressor biallelically inactivated in rhabdoid tumors.
of INI1 as a tumor suppressor has facilitated accurate diagnosis of rhabdoid tumors.
rate of transcription for SWI/SNF and HDAC complexes seem to be regulated by the INI1 gene.
is the first pediatric brain tumor for which a candidate tumor suppressor gene has been identified.
mutation or deletion in the INI1/hSNF5 gene occurs in the majority of AT/RT tumors.
is mainly point mutations on the hSNF5/INI1 gene (i.e., one can diagnosis AT/RT without a chromosome 22 deletion elsewhere).
hSNF5/INI1 gene regulates 15 or so proteins in the chromatin structure.
addition, the OPN gene has a higher expression in AT/RT tumors.
are also some emerging mouse models of the AT/RT cancer as well as experimental cell lines derived from tumors.
these advances, the function of the gene is not yet understood.
teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are very rare tumors and absolute risk to siblings is not reported in the literature.
are suspected to arise from germ-line genetic mutations in a parent shared by affected siblings.
is the study and diagnosis of disease through examination of organs, tissues, bodily fluids and whole bodies (Autopsy).
and rhabdoid tumor share the term "rhabdoid" because under a microscope both tumors resemble rhabdomyosarcoma.
is the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of plants and animals.
is performed by examining a thin slice of tissue under a light microscope.
much as 70% of the tumor may be made up of PNET-like cells.
characteristic whorls of intermediate filaments in the rhabdoid tumors (as with rhabdoid tumors in any area of the body).
and associates found sickle-shaped embracing cells, previously unreported, in all of 11 cases of AT/RT.
staining is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
technique called FISH may be able to help locate a mutation or abnormality that may be allowing tumor growth.
the other hand, chromosomal 22 deletions are very comomon in AT/RTs.
it should be noted that this mutation is not present in 100% of cases.
initial diagnosis of a tumor is made with a radiographic study (MRI or CT-).
is difficult to diagnose AT/RT only from radiographic study; usually a pathologist must perform a cytological or genetic analysis.
of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important as one-third of patients will have intracranial dissemination with involvement of the CSF.
tumor cells, eccentricity of the nuclei and prominent nucleoli are consistent findings.
only a minority of AT/RT biopsies have rhabdoid cells, making diagnosis more difficult.
correct diagnosis of the tumor is critical to any protocol.
have shown that 8% to over 50% of AT/RT tumors are diagnosed incorrectly.
critical step in treatment planning is to determine the correct histology of the tumor.
of the tumor histology can lead to errors in treatment and prognosis.
teratoid/rhaboid tumor closely resembles medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, choroid plexus carcinoma, and some kinds of germ cell tumor.
characteristics may be present only in focal areas or may be less pronounced.
kinds of germ cell tumor secrete tumor markers AFP or bHCG; AT/RTs do not.
can occur at any sites within the CNS; however, approximately 60% are located in the posterior fossa or cerebellar area.
ASCO study showed 52% posterior fossa; 39% sPNET (supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors); 5% pineal; 2% spinal, and 2% multi-focal.
tumors'appearance on CT and MRI are nonspecific, tending towards large size, calcifications, necrosis (tissue death),and hemorrhage (bleeding).
studies alone cannot identify AT/RT; a pathologist almost always has to evaluate a brain tissue sample.
increased cellularity of the tumor may make the appearance on an uncontrasted CT to have increased attenuation.
parts of the tumor often enhance with contrast MRI finding on T1 and T2 weighted images are variable.
T2 weighted images may show an iso-signal or slightly hyper-signal.
components of the tumor may enhance with contrast but do not always.
studies appear to be more able to pick up metastatic foci in other intracranial locations as well as intraspinal locations.
plays a critical role in obtaining tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.
Global Fund also plays a critical role in strengthening health care in developing countries.
usual, Merkel has a critical role to play.
or more children will have disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis.
50% of the AT/RTs will transiently respond, but chemotherapy by itself is rarely curative.
strategy is based upon observations that children under three have significant long term complications as a result of brain irradiation.
dose and volume of radiation had not been standardized, however, radiation does appear to improve survival.
use of radiation has been limited in children younger than three because of the risk of severe neurocognitive deficits.
are protocols using conformal, local radiation in the young child to try to cure this tumor.
beam radiation was only offered at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and at Loma Linda, California as of 2002.
2003 three or four more proton therapy centers have opened in the United States.
Jude Children's Research Hospital is in the process of building one at their Memphis, Tn.
inhibitors are a new class of anticancer agents targeted directly at chromatin remodeling.
agents have been used in acute promyelocytic leukemia and have been found to affect the HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression.
is too little understanding of the INI1 deficiency to predict whether HDAC inhibitors will be effective against AT/RTs.
are some laboratory results that indicate it is effective against certain AT/RT cell lines.
children aged 3 years or older the EFS was 78% and the OS 89%.
ASCO study of the 188 documented AT/RT cases prior to 2004 found 30% of the cases had metastasis at diagnosis.
spread to the meninges (leptomenigeal spread sometimes referred to as sugar coating) is common both initially and with relapse.
case of metastatic disease to the abdomen via ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been reported with AT/RT.
and Sugita separately reported cases of lung metastasis without a shunt.
with other CNS tumors, slightly more males are affected than females (ratio 1.6:1).
teratoid/rhabdoid tumor was first described as a distinct entity in 1987.
1978, when rhabdoid tumor was described, AT/RT likely was misdiagnosed as medulloblastoma.
some early reports the tumor was known also as malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of the CNS.
1978 and 1987, AT/RT was usually misdiagnosed as rhabdoid tumor.
participants from 14 institutions came together to discuss the biology, treatments and new strategies for these tumors.
consensus paper on the biology of the tumor was published in Clinical Research.
observation is not surprising because rhabdoid tumors at both locations possess similar histologic, clinical, and demographic features.
most children with AT/RT are enrolled in clinical trials to attempt to find an effective cure.
clinical trial is not a treatment standard; it is research.
clinical trials compare an experimental treatment to a standard treatment, but only if such a standard treatment exists.
2011, "The New Yorker" published an article by Aleksandar Hemon, about the author's daughter's battle with AT/RT.
September 26, 2012, she died after battling AT/RT for five and a half years.
typical HTM network is a tree-shaped hierarchy of "levels" that are composed of smaller elements called "nodes" or "columns".
single level in the hierarchy is also called a "region".
hierarchy levels often have fewer nodes and therefore less spatial resolvability.
hierarchy levels can reuse patterns learned at the lower levels by combining them to memorize more complex patterns.
learning and inference modes, sensory data comes into the bottom level nodes.
generation mode, the bottom level nodes output the generated pattern of a given category.
then identifies temporal sequences of spatial patterns that are likely to occur one after another.
training, a node receives a temporal sequence of spatial patterns as its input.
inference (recognition), the node calculates the set of probabilities that a pattern belongs to each known coincidence.
it calculates the probabilities that the input represents each temporal group.
set of probabilities assigned to the groups is called a node's "belief" about the input pattern.
a simplified implementation, node's belief consists of only one winning group).
output of the node will not change as much, and a resolution in time is lost.
higher-level node combines this output with the output from other child nodes thus forming its own input pattern.
is meant to reflect the organization of the physical world as it is perceived by human brain.
long, the digital world and the physical world will be indistinguishable.
actions and objects) are perceived to change more slowly and consist of smaller concepts that change more quickly.
Hawkins postulates that brains evolved this type of hierarchy to match, predict, and affect the organization of the external world.
details about the functioning of Zeta 1 HTM can be found in Numenta's old documentation.
new generation of HTM learning algorithms relies on fixed-sparsity distributed representations.
models cortical columns that tend to inhibit neighboring columns in the neocortex thus creating a sparse activation of columns.
HTM region consists of a number of highly interconnected cortical columns.
cortical column is understood as a group of cells that have the same receptive field.
column has a number of cells that are able to remember several previous states.
cell can be in one of three states: active, inactive and predictive state.
on the input pattern, some columns will receive more active input values.
input patterns tend to activate a stable set of columns.
a cell learns to recognize a known sequence by checking whether the connected cells are active.
output of a region includes columns in both active and predictive states.
columns are active over longer periods of time, which leads to greater temporal stability seen by the parent region.
learning algorithms are able to learn continuously from each new input pattern, therefore no separate inference mode is necessary.
inferenhce, HTM tries to match the stream of inputs to fragments of previously learned sequences.
allows each HTM region to be constantly predicting the likely continuation of the recognized sequences.
index of the predicted sequence is the output of the region.
learning algorithms are currently being offered as commercial SaaS by Numenta (such as Grok).
the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested.
our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track.
the machine learning world they don’t care about that, only how well it works on practical problems.
the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice."
high-level structures and functionality of neocortex with HTM is most appropriate.
attempts to implement the functionality that is characteristic of a hierarchically related group of cortical regions in the neocortex.
single HTM node may represent a group of cortical columns within a certain region.
neocortex is organized in vertical columns of 6 horizontal layers.
6 layers of cells in the neocortex should not be confused with levels in an HTM hierarchy.
nodes attempt to model a portion of cortical columns (80 to 100 neurons) with approximately 20 HTM "cells" per column.
HTM attempts to model a portion of the cortex's learning and plasticity as described above.
memory component with neural networks has a long history dating back to early research in distributed representations and self-organizing maps.
store information in "dense" representations such as a 32 bit word where all combinations of 1s and 0s are possible.
human neocortex has roughly 100 billion neurons, but at any given time only a small percent are active.
activity of neurons are like bits in a computer, and therefore the representation is sparse.
bits in SDRs have semantic meaning, and that meaning is distributed across the bits.
to a Bayesian network, an HTM comprises a collection of nodes that are arranged in a tree-shaped hierarchy.
node in the hierarchy discovers an array of causes in the input patterns and temporal sequences it receives.
Bayesian belief revision algorithm is used to propagate feed-forward and feedback beliefs from child to parent nodes and vice versa.
theory of hierarchical cortical computation based on Bayesian belief propagation was proposed earlier by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford.
HTM is mostly consistent with these ideas, it adds details about handling invariant representations in the visual cortex.
any system that models details of the neocortex, HTM can be viewed as an artificial neural network.
tree-shaped hierarchy commonly used in HTMs resembles the usual topology of traditional neural networks.
attempt to model cortical columns (80 to 100 neurons) and their interactions with fewer HTM "neurons".
these networks are, at present, too complex for realistic application.
of HTM to various AI ideas are described in the December 2005 issue of the Artificial Intelligence journal.
HTM model has been implemented in a research release of a software API called "Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing" (NuPIC).
number of HTM software development tools have been implemented using NuPIC:
Block Museum was established in 1980 when Chicago art collectors Mary and Leigh B.
(former vice president of Inland Steel Company), donated funds to Northwestern University for the construction of an art exhibition venue.
Vice President Dick Cheney came to the White House after serving as CEO of Halliburton.
recognition of their gift, the University named the changing exhibition space the Mary and Leigh Block Gallery.
Block embarked on a major reconstruction project in 1999 and reopened in a new facility in September 2000.
museum also commissions new work by artists to foster connections between artists and the public through the creative process.
Block often collaborates with these museums on exhibitions that travel across the country and the world.
original museum building was constructed in 1980 and was designed by Chicago architecture firm Loebl, Schlossman, and Hackl.
museum's Pick-Laudati Auditorium is home to Block Cinema, a longstanding film program featuring international, classic and arthouse cinema.
selection of films at Block Cinema is curated in part by students in the Northwestern University Film and Projection Society.
Block Museum houses a rich permanent collection of nearly 5,000 artworks.

paperless office is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced.
is done by converting documents and other papers into digital form.
concept can be extended to communications outside the office as well.
paperless office was a publicist's slogan, intended to describe the office of the future.
was facilitated by the popularization of video display computer terminals like the 1964 IBM 2260.
early prediction of the paperless office was made in a 1975 "Business Week" article.
the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the "paperless office" was not.
term "The Paperless Office" was first used in commerce by Micronet, Inc., an automated office equipment company, in 1978.
recognition and speech synthesis could also be used to facilitate the storage of information digitally.
computer data is printed on paper, it becomes out-of-sync with computer database updates.
paperless office would have a single-source collection point for distributed database updates, and a publish-subscribe system.

product manufacturing contributes significantly to deforestation and man-made climate change, and produces greenhouse gases.
to the American Forest& Paper Association, paper manufacturing is the third largest user of fossil fuels worldwide.
production also leads to air pollution, as paper manufacturing releases nitrogen dioxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO), and carbon dioxide (CO).
dioxide and sulfur dioxide are major contributors to acid rain, whereas CO is a greenhouse gas responsible for climate change.
water discharged from pulp and paper mills contains solids, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter that are classified as pollutants.
such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause or exacerbate eutrophication of fresh water bodies.
technologies that may be used with electronic forms automation include-
there are sufficient cost-effective options available, including solutions that do not require end-users to purchase hardware or software.
we have already used up many of the low-cost options that were once available.
tags can be added to each file to make it easier to locate certain files throughout the entire system.
paperless software offers a scanner, hardware and software and works seamlessly in separating and organizing important documents.
of these technologies uses software that converts the raster formats (bitmaps) into other forms depending on need.
combination of OCR and raster is used to enable search ability while maintaining the original form of the document.
important step is the labeling related to paper-to-digital conversion and the cataloging of scanned documents.
issue faced by those wishing to take the paperless philosophy to the limit has been copyright laws.
communication requires both the sender and the recipient to have easy access to appropriate software and hardware.
may be costs and temporary productivity losses when converting to a paperless office.
regulations and business policy may also slow down the change.
there may be a reduction of paper, but some uses of paper will remain.
the other hand, commercially feasible technology is widely available to digitize documents, even full libraries of backlogs, at feasible cost.
Sufficient processing power is available to perform massive amounts of optical character recognition.
with the Swiss jurist Gustave Moynier, he founded the Institut de Droit International and became its first "Honorary President".

excelled in the Gymnasium of Ghent and his musical skills quickly became apparent.
then returned home and studied law at the University of Ghent.
graduating, he followed his father's example and went to Berlin for further studies.
1859, he married Emilie Jaecquemyns and henceforth used the name "Rolin-Jaequemyns".
first issue, edited by Rolin-Jaequemyns and with contributions from many noted scholars appeared late 1868.

members laid the foundation of significant parts of modern international law.
1904, two years after Rolin-Jaequemyns died, the institute received the Nobel Peace Prize.
the revolution year of 1848, the liberal faction was dominant in Belgian politics.
were Catholic cabinets, but these, generally, adopted the liberal agenda of "Laissez faire, laissez passer".
1850 onward, the controversy between the Catholic Party and the liberals deepened.
sharpened the anti-clerical sentiment among liberals which evolved into a militant anti-Catholicism.
complete secularisation of Belgian society became the liberals'prime objective.

from periodic trips to Europe, he stayed until April 1901 when his health could no longer tolerate the climate.
was being pressured by the colonial powers to open up and modernize the country for trade.
1855 Chulalongkorn's father King Mongkut (Rama IV) agreed to a one-sided treaty with Britain.
first condition severely limited the government's ability to undertake major development projects.
contrast the French colonial government in Saigon charged 10% duties.)
second condition eliminated the monopolies by which the Royal household and noble families financed themselves.

most CGE models conform only loosely to the theoretical general equilibrium paradigm.
models are descended from the input-output models pioneered by Wassily Leontief, but assign a more important role to prices.
modelling of richer economies descends from Leif Johansen's 1960 MSG model of Norway, and the static model developed by the
models were pragmatic in flavour, and traced variables through time.
Australian MONASH model is a modern representative of this class.
the first CGE model similar to those of today was that of Taylor and Black (1974).
example, a tax on flour might affect bread prices, the CPI, and hence perhaps wages and employment.
recently, CGE has been a popular way to estimate the economic effects of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
models always contain more variables than equations—so some variables must be set outside the model.
variables are termed exogenous; the remainder, determined by the model, are called endogenous.
choice of which variables are to be exogenous is called the model closure, and may give rise to controversy.
example, some modelers hold employment and the trade balance fixed; others allow these to vary.
defining technology, consumer tastes, and government instruments (such as tax rates) are usually exogenous.
of the most well-known CGE models is global: the GTAP model of world trade.
strong, reasonable, assumptions embedded in the model must replace historical evidence.
developing economies are often analysed using CGE models, such as those based on the IFPRI template model.
is true for developed economies no less than for a developing economy like China.
CGE models are comparative-static: they model the reactions of the economy at only one point in time.
contrast, dynamic CGE models explicitly trace each variable through time—often at annual intervals.
CGE models are those that can be solved sequentially (one period at a time).
assume that behaviour depends only on current and past states of the economy.
the latter group dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models explicitly incorporate uncertainty about the future.
CGE models were often solved by a program custom-written for that particular model.
most CGE models are formulated and solved using one of the GAMS or GEMPACK software systems.

common bush tanager ("Chlorospingus flavopectus") is a small passerine bird.
is a resident breeder in the highlands from central Mexico south to Bolivia and northwest Argentina.
populations in fact appear to be more distinct than several other members of "Chlorospingus".
have a brown head with a (usually) thin supercilium and a white spot behind the eye and a light throat.
upperparts are olive and the underparts yellow, becoming white on the belly.
are browner above, darker below, and have a duller olive eye spot.
are covered in dark gray down feathers and have bright yellow bills.
related sooty-capped bush tanager ("C. pileatus") has a blacker head with a bold white supercilium rather than an eye spot.
Venezuelan population of the common bush tanager would, if this taxon is split up, be assigned to a distinct species.
normal clutch is two eggs in most of the range.
species is regularly double-brooded at least in part of its range.
female incubates for much of the day, while both parents provide the young with food.
the nestlings near fledging, they are fed every 15 minutes or so on average.
the genus "Chlorospingus" was placed with the tanager family, Thraupidae.
recent research suggests that they are actually aberrant brush finches in the Emberizidae and particularly close to "Arremonops".
particular, recent research suggests four key policy areas in which governments should consider intervening.
wide range and considerable morphological variation displayed by "C. ophthalmicus" has been a problem for ornithologists for many decades.
many taxa presently united in this species were considered distinct, but they were eventually all lumped together.
recent results suggest that the common bush tanager is actually a superspecies.
preliminary study of allozyme data found pronounced divergences between the northern populations.
ATPase 8 sequence data found five major clades in the Mexican populations alone.
song is a high thin "whichis whichis witchery tsee tseep seeur" with many variations.
direct descendants of the original colonizers of Mesoamerica are the southernmost Mesoamerican group, as is to be expected.
other groups west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec radiated rather synchronously between 3 and 4 mya.
it appears that the common bush tanager evolved in and was always confined to montane cloud forest.
ecological data shows some interesting differences between southern populations too.
subspecies appear to be well distinct, and there is much evidence suggesting they are distinct species.
birds are generally duskier and more indistinctly marked on the head than the northern populations.
undetermined and possibly new subspecies is found in Lara state in Venezuela, for example in Yacambú National Park.
dawn song consists of a monotonous series of "chit" or "chup" notes.
fact, they have time and again been treated as a good species "C. flavopectus".
white throat is almost devoid of spotting, and there is no white ear spot.
populations also tend to give long series of "chit" calls between their songs.
the far south of the species'range, "C. o. argentatus" is found in the yungas of northwestern Argentina.
is not known exactly how these birds relate to the taxa higher up in the Andes; they are generally little-studied.

the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa.
present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century.
name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion.
later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.
Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.
etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile.
3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.
major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa.
this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.
domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures.
is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.
4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.
climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification.
influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.
founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.
settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast.
missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.
the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa.
a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes.
North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers.
the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.
most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire.
the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north.
Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first.
is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri.
Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu.
bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.
West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities.
1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.
Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups.
was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories.
sought to end the European powers'Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence.
set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.
movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened.
followed suit the next year (March 1957), becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence.
of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.
Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism.
colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism.
vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule.
instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders.
political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule.
the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations.
and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.

their Berber subjects "the nobles offered protection in exchange for tribute and military service."
promised safety against attacks by another tribe, but also against "slave raiders" from the cities.
so equipped the nobles "occupied key positions in Roman provincial administration."
the intervening 350 years the struggle had gone on—hot or cold, or'underground'.
Firmus and Gildo enlisted the dispossessed by aligning with the dissenting Donatist churches and its more radical circumcellion movement.

has an expansive cultural heritage, including monuments, clothing items, museums, and traditional food.
history many monuments were changed, destroyed and new elements were added to them.
of the historical monuments are stationed in the district of the cities of Pristina, Prizren and Peja.
in Kosovo mostly consist of ancient cities, castles (Kulla), monasteries, mosques and churches.
because of the many wars that Kosovo went through in different years and times, many monuments were destroyed.

housed here are exhibits expressing the day in the life for the people in various regions.
extensive permanent archaeology exhibition details life in the region in the Illyrian, Dardanian and Roman periods.
front of the building recent history is represented by some artillery hardware, and two large Jewish gravestones.
museum objectives are to save, protect and present the Cultural Heritage of Kosovo.
clothes in Kosovo take a special place in Cultural heritage of Kosovo.
were homemade clothes or made by craftsman specialized in that field.
clothing in Kosovo resembles much of the Albanian traditional clothing if not all the same.
is the pants or dress, depending on the style and gender.
men usually have on long woolen white pants called tirq or a fustanella which is a skirt like costume.
the past they used decorated guns, decorated pocket clocks, decorated cigarettes boxes etc.
plis and tirq are being worn combined with European modern clothes to symbolize national identity.
Clothing is one of the major factors that has distinguished this nation from its neighboring countries.
women’s clothing was better preserved than men as there are regional variations in how these traditional clothes are worn.
next style is often referred to as the most beautiful of Kosovo clothing.
Veshja e Dukagjinit was a white long sleeve cotton shirt but the edges were colorfully embodied.
last style for the women was that of the southern region of has.
clothing was more distinctive and is commonly found today as it has survived and embraced changes in styles.
look consists of a short white shirt and a full length linen dress.
clothing was a symbol of beauty, however it was less preservative.
women’s clothing men’s clothing is more uniformed and seemed to change less from region to region.
best-known of all and most distinctive one, "flija", is prepared year-round but is a summer favourite.

set of laws and rules used to be oral and got published later.
Ottoman Empire left behind their religion, their language, and their people in Kosovo(dating back to the 14th century).
addition the first foreign language that every student must demonstrate proficiency, is English.
90% of Kosovar-Albanians are of Islamic religion primarily due to the occupation of the Ottoman Empire.

follow five pillars of their faith: testimony, prayer, alms-giving, fasting, and pilgrimage.
or customary rules are very frequently practiced as law and order among Kosovans with its principles being as followed:
the current modern times, the former customs and traditions are gradually vanishing due to the influence of the western world
elderly generations are the ones who assist in keeping such customs and traditions alive.
societies have customs and traditions; new ones have courts and legislatures.
Oda symbolizes the court of law where men, gather to discuss and solve property problems, blood feuds etc.
space was also an important platform of social, cultural life and entertainment for men.
after many centuries of practice, "Oda" is still alive and valued in certain communities in Kosovo (mainly rural).
"man of Besa" connotes a man of respect and honour, someone to whom you can trust your life and family.

project is organised by CHwB and UN Habitat and has had great success in the past years.
strategic and political orientation of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport of Kosovo includes the following:
measure health care quality to identify problems caused by overuse, underuse, or misuse of health resources.
1999, the Institute of Medicine released six domains to measure and describe quality of care in health:
due to strict regulations placed on health services research, data sources are not always complete.
of health care quality may occur on two different levels: that of the individual patient and that of populations.
assurance is distinct from quality assessment and is based on the principles of total quality management (TQM).
is a method of using quality assessment measures in a system-wide manner to deliver high-quality care that is continually improving.
three domains are tightly linked and build on each other.
health care service is sometimes not cost efficient due to either overutilization or underutilization.
costs will rise, increasing the strain on budgets.
or overuse, occurs when the value of health care is diluted with wasted resources.
depriving someone else of the potential benefits from obtaining the service.
or risks of treatment outweigh the benefits in overused health care.
example is the lack of early cancer detection and treatment which leads to decreased cancer survival rates.
critical pathways to reduce costs and errors improves quality by providing a systematic approach to assessing health care outcomes.
variations in practice patterns promotes improved collaboration among interdisciplinary players in the health care system.
is a change in patients'health, such as reduction in pain, relapses, or death rates.
the practice of medicine improves quality of care by concurrently promoting lower costs and better outcomes.
presumption is providers following medical guidelines are giving the best care and give the most hope of a good outcome.
widely used form of defensive medicine is ordering costly imaging which can be wasteful.
other defensive behaviors may actually reduce access to care and pose risks of physical harm.
specialty physicians report doing more for patients, such as using unnecessary diagnostic tests, because of malpractice risks.
satisfaction surveys are the main qualitative measure of the patient perspective.
a result, patient satisfaction surveys have become a somewhat controversial measure of quality care.
argue that patient surveys can provide needed feedback to physicians to assist on improving their practice.
addition, patient satisfaction often correlates with patient involvement in decision making and can improve patient-centered care.
early as the 19th century, healthcare quality improvement interventions were implemented in an effort to improve healthcare outcomes.
after, influenced by the work of Dr. Codman, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded.
1918, the ACS developed the Minimum Standard for Hospitals, which was one page.
the first on-site inspections of 692 hospitals, only 13% met the minimum standard.
Deming, a philosopher, placed emphasis on the macro level of organizational management and improvement via a systems approach.
on the other hand, strategized quality planning, control, and improvement at the micro level.
encouraged questions, believing they deepened understanding of problems and led to increased effectiveness in planning and taking action.
1952, the ACS formally transferred its Hospital Standardization Program to JCAH.
demonstrated a new perspective on analyzing healthcare quality that was based on structure, process, and outcome.
National Academy of Sciences established the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1970.
IOM, a non-profit and independent scientific advisor, was created to improve health on a national scale.
1990, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) was entrusted to offer accreditation programs for managed care organizations.
NCQA was established as an independent non-profit dedicated to improving health care quality through accreditation and performance measurement.
1991, Dr. Don Berwick’s non-profit Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) was founded.
than only focus on national health care quality improvement, IHI campaigned but nationally and worldwide.
the focus onto the patient as a consumer, the National Patient Safety Foundation was established in 1996.
private, non-profit forum aims to standardize health care delivery and measurements of quality.
recently, the focus of quality improvement has been emerging health information technology (e.g., electronic health records and patient-centered care.
a result, the formation of Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH) began to gain popularity in 2007.
PCMH, care among personal primary care physicians and specialists increased coordination and integration of care for the patient.
the world, many primary care physicians underestimate the seriousness of depression.
technology was used to maintain personal health information and enhance quality and safety.
2007, various studies have demonstrated the wide array of benefits of PCMHs in healthcare quality improvement.
organizations have established measures to define quality since providers, patients and payers have different views and expectations of quality.
and AHRQ have collectively established the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey.
CAHPS survey collects uniform measures of patients'perspectives on various aspects of the care they receive in inpatient settings.
consumers, and researchers may also use the data to make informed business choices.
a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of Health, is the sector regulator for health services in England.
professions in the UK also have their own membership and regulatory associations.
comparison is generally done for energy requirements for heating and cooling of indoor space.
are many energy rating tools by which one can calculate the energy performance of a building.
performance scores use generally a scale ranging from 0 to 100 or 1 to 5 stars.
Recommendations:HERS can produce a list of recommended improvements based on some life cycle's effective cost analysis.
recommendations may be pertaining to any of the inefficient components of a building i.e.
layer in the composite wall of building, air conditioning equipment, water heating unit, Double-glazed windows, etc.
per the national energy policies, the HERS are known by different names in different countries.
policy is national, but the sector’s externalities are global.
implementation and promotion of HERS in a country depends upon the national energy policy.
all this, the aim of all HERS is almost same and it can be classified into three types.
in population, Economic issues are the some factors which have escalated the energy demand across the world.
this high growth in energy consumption it also causes to increase the production of green house gases to the atmosphere.
currently shares approximately 40% of energy in most of the countries and are considered among the largest end-use sector.
per International energy agency (IEA) world energy consumption and green house gases level is going to increase rapidly every year.
recognize the building sector as one of the most cost effective sector where energy consumption can be reduced.
star is the first house-rating scheme of Australia, which was developed in 1980 by the GMI council of Australia.
scheme was basically based on the three basic elements, glass, mass and insulation of dwelling.
to many limitation this system get failed in attaining popularity and in 1990s they develop Victorian scheme.
rating scheme was much flexible and was suitable to all climatic conditions of Australia.
is recently replaced by AccuRate due to some limitations in the software.
three groups are evaluate individually and the combined results of these indicates the level of efficiency of a building.
energy ratings in Canada have been in existence since 1997.
of these programs use HOT2XP and HOT 2000 as their rating tools.
the aforesaid government rating programs in Canada, there are two standard bases are available for evaluating the building are;
is used in Canada as one of home rating scheme.
China, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) develop a national building energy rating and labeling HERS in 2008.
HERS is mandatory for government buildings, big commercial complexes and those buildings applying for public retrofit funding or green label.
HERS consist a star rating scheme, ranging from 1 to 5 star.
per this HERS, more the star, more will be the energy efficiency of the building.
Denmark, the energy rating scheme are in existence since 1981.
is the first country in Europe(EU) to begin issuing Energy Performance certificates (EPCs).
EPCs are mandatory in all types of buildings in Denmark.
France, Diagnostic de performance energetique (DPE) is used as HERS.
of the measurements comprises 7-label ratings, ranging from A (best) to G (worst) which are presented by the color coding.
ratings, the green color represents A and red color represents G label.
Ireland, the building energy ratings are in existence since 2007.
this country Building Energy Rating (BER) is used as EPC.
to transparency in this HERS, there is a more awareness among the peoples and is accepted widely.
Portugal, the EPCs scheme was launched in July 2007 and was implemented for new buildings.
use of this scheme was extended to existing buildings in January 2009.
rating scheme covers mainly the indoor air quality and energy performance of the buildings.
compliance in the country is high and the EPC is issued only when 90% of building completion and transaction observed.
is a national database who covers all EPCs registration record and this is available for all countrymen.
UK, Currently National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme is used widely.
scheme measure the thermal efficiency of the dwellings on a scale of 0-10 in terms of energy running cost.
for dwelling energy rating it use some standard assumptions, such as occupancy scenario, thermostat setting, occupant stay timings.
the various HERS Energy rated homes of America is used widely.
this rating scheme a higher star rated house represents higher energy efficiency of the house.
energy efficiency rating in this HERS represents the predicted energy consumption, represents the form of normalized annual energy consumption.

first state convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in South Carolina was held on May 12, 1785.
Smith was elected South Carolina's first bishop on February 10, 1795, at the 12th convention.
Episcopal Church in South Carolina remained disorganized and stagnant during the immediate years after the Revolutionary War.
strong congregationalist tendencies held by the churches contributed to a lack of interest beyond local affairs.
Smith had died in 1801 and there was no standing committee to examine candidates for holy orders.
the 1804 convention, a standing committee was appointed, and Edward Jenkins was elected bishop.
lingering fear of tyrannical bishops would leave South Carolina without a bishop until 1812 when Theodore Dehon was elected.
1922, the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina was created from territory formerly part of the original diocese.
October 15, 2012, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori notified Lawrence of this decision.
Bishops Disciplinary Board cited three specific actions by Lawrence which, it stated, showed his abandonment of his ordination vows.
resolutions were to take effect if the national church took disciplinary action against Bishop Lawrence or other diocesan leadership.

are the bishops who have served the South Carolina diocese connected to the Episcopal Church:
is located in the municipalities of Bavay and Saint-Waast in the Nord department.
reserve was created to protect fifteen plants of regional interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive.
site consists of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the Famennian stage in the Late Devonian epoch.
new soil was re-colonized by pioneer species, which coexist alongside an established afforestation, forming a mosaic of habitats.
Bocage de l'Avesnois, a non-governmental organization, is the owner and operator of the reserve.
this end, regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species, such as Japanese knot weed.
secondary objectives are environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and flora, and environmental monitoring.
Bocage de l'Avesnois owns a parcel of land on the other side of the railtrack.
not yet included in the reserve, it is expected to be added when the current agreement is renewed.
quarrying operations ceased, the quarry was filled mainly with the marl of the Bellignies quarry.
area has since been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession.
is supplied with water only by precipitation, which is retained by the natural properties of marl.
reserve's nearest weather station is at Cambrai, about 42 kilometres away, inland, to the southeast.
site is a former quarry, used for its sandstone deposits as early as the late nineteenth century.
obtained were then classified by eye into stone for cobble and rubble for macadam.
ceased in the early 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones extracted were no longer of sufficient quality.
1971 and 1978, the quarry was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies quarry.
then, the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession, forming tree, shrub and herb layers.
the meantime, she contacted the five owners to consider a land management proposal.
commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003.
CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois became the owner/ operator of 85 percent of the site.

these Paleozoic strata, the Devonian presents as a sandstone base of the Lower Famennian, where the levels were quarried
stone that was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage.
360 million years ago, the thrust of forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed.
beds issue from siltation of the biostromes present in the Frasnian epoch, 370 million years ago.
Famennian strata represent the top of the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping.
strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.
million years ago, during the Ypresian age, locally called Landenian, forms of marl of the Porquerie are found.
comes from the alteration of Cretaceous rocks and takes the form of a brown or greenish plastic clay without fossils.
stratum is covered with silt composed of clay, sand and flints and Roman pottery pieces, of the late Neogene age.
origin can be attributed to the alteration of the underlying rocks and wind erosion.
stones used to backfill the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry.
is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate paléozoïc stones.
rocks contain "Praeactinocamax plenus", "Chlamys asper", "Ostrea diluviana" and radiated fossils: "Janira quadricostata", "Cyprina ligeriensis", "Arca mailleana".
tall herb fringe community with "Petasites hybridus", at the limit of its range, is also exceptional.
wood-fringe "Lathyro sylvestris– Astragaletum glycyphylli" is also regionally interesting.
reserve has 171 plant species, and 15 of them have heritage interest.
of them were inventoried in 2003, and their populations have been managed since.
light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid ("Dactylorhiza fuchsii ") and round-leaved wintergreen ("Pyrola rotundifolia").
milkvetch ("Astragalus glycyphyllos ") and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea ("Lathyrus sylvestris") are present in the small herb glade.
population of lesser butterfly-orchid ("Platanthera bifolia") is located in the pioneer wood.
the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid ("Anacamptis pyramidalis").
orchid ("Ophrys apifera ") and man orchid ("Orchis anthropophora") grow everywhere, except in the older glade.
the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not ("Myosotis sylvatica ") and zigzag clover ("Trifolium medium").
the 115 species recorded in 2004 on the site, 15 are included in the red list of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.
mammals found here include the red fox, red squirrel, hare and rabbit, mole, wood mouse, bank vole and field vole.
species of bats frequent the site regularly to hunt: the Daubenton's bat ("Myotis daubentonii ") and common pipistrelle ("Pipistrellus pipistrellus").
cannot, however, establish their habitat due to the lack of roosting sites in the reserve's young trees.
species of birds have been observed on the site, 25 of which are breeding there.
northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding.
common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.
common toad ("Bufo bufo ") and the common frog ("Rana temporaria") are the only amphibians on the site.
viviparous lizard ("Zootoca vivipara") likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track.
hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects.
common wall lizard ("Podarcis muralis") has been seen in 2013.
attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.
of Odonata is not possible on the site because of the lack of standing water.
species of butterflies and 105 species of moth enjoy the floral diversity of the site.
the south, the Forêt de Mormal is a major area for biodiversity covered by ZNIEFF and Natura 2000 sites.
the past, the site was threatened by garbage dumps or by passage of 4x4 vehicles or quads.
installation of gates by the municipality of Bavay solved the problem.
greatest threats to the species are primary succession and invasive plants.
marls was colonized by pioneer species, then shrubs and trees, corresponding to a primary succession.
dynamic may eventually lead to the disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species.
woodlands can also play an important role in creating habitat for many species.
no one plays a more important role in creating the necessary public atmosphere than Vladislav Surkov.
small-reed ("Calamagrostis epigejos") is present in the center of the site and threatens to spread into herbaceous areas.
compromises sustainability of stations, including "man orchid" and "bee orchid" populations.
first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value.
orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning.
less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper ("Tetrix tenuicornis")) are pulled.
the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion.
extensive areas of Japanese knotweed ("Fallopia japonica") are on the site.
stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern, colonized by invasive species, are managed by manual removal and disposal for incineration.
around the ruins and along the south-east of the site near the houses.
for mammals, insects, nesting wrens), they are not eradicated but contained.
golden-rod ("Solidago canadensis") appeared in 2003 as a result of plant deposits.
stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site.
plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.
panicled aster ("Symphyotrichum lanceolatum") is also present among the invasive plants.
their native countries, American asters are found in wet places.
France, these plants colonize relatively dry ruderal areas (brownfields, road shoulder...) or wetlands.
second version of the environmental management scheme covers the period 2007–2012.
preservation of the existing diversity was the most important goal.
areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained.
infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.
Bavay's municipality has erected two barriers to prohibit access to motorized vehicles.
and employees of the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois manage the site regularly.
removal of the Japanese knotweed has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern.
grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful.
bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch.
spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing.
2007 to 2012, the number of round-leaved wintergreen footage increased by 50 percent.
the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually.
observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores.

knowlesi is a primate malaria parasite commonly found in Southeast Asia.
causes malaria in long-tailed macaques ("Macaca fascicularis"), but it may also infect humans, either naturally or artificially.
knowlesi " is the sixth major human malaria parasite (following the division of"Plasmodium ovale" into 2 subspecies).
is an emerging infection that was reported for the first time in humans in 1965.
accounts for up to 70% of malaria cases in certain areas in South East Asia where it is mostly found.
parasite is transmitted by the bite of an "Anopheles" mosquito.
knowlesi" has health, social and economic consequences for the regions affected by it.
social and economic consequences of the current arrangements should be unacceptable.
was interested in kala azar and was working under Napier.
inoculated the strain into three monkeys, one of which was a rhesus macaque ("Macaca mulatta"), which developed a fulminating infection.
Das Gupta maintained the species by serial passage in monkeys until Dr Knowles returned from leave.
was named by Sinton and Mulligan in 1932 after Dr Knowles.
"P. knowlesi" could be the fifth species capable of causing endemic malaria in humans.
makes it a potentially very severe disease if it remains untreated.
mosquito ingests gametocytes, which have been formed in the mammalian host.
are either microgametocytes (which are male gametocytes) or macrogametocytes (which are female gametetocytes).
gametocytes mature into microgametes and macrogametes respectively, and then fertilize to form zygotes within the midgut of the mosquito.
the oocysts mature to release sporozoites which move to salivary gland of the mosquito.
gametocyte → (microgamete or macrogamete) → zygote → ookinete → oocyst → sporozoites.
are unleashed into the blood stream to infect erythrocytes constituting one asexual cycle of infection of the erythrocytes.
gametocytes remain in the blood to be ingested by mosquitoes.
more and more people who live in the semi-urban areas are being found to be infected with knowlesi malaria.
cases of this type of malaria were reported in Malaysia in 2014.
Malaysia, but there are also reports on the Thai-Burmese border.
fifth of the cases of malaria diagnosed in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo are due to "P. knowlesi".
knowlesi" is the most common cause of malaria in childhood in the Kudat district of Sabah, Malaysia.
practice human malaria appears to be almost entirely due to monkey to human transmission.
known vectors belong to the genus "Anopheles", subgenus "Cellia", series "Neomyzomyia" and group "Leucosphyrus".
cracens " has also been reported as a vector of"P.
species of mosquitoes have been shown to contain as many as 1,000 sporozoites suggesting that they may be efficient vectors.
study of potential vectors in Malayasia suggests that "Anopheles cracens" may be an important vector of "P. knowlesi".
parasite may multiply rapidly resulting in very high parasite densities that may be fatal.
knowlesi " can only be accurately distinguished from"P. malariae" using PCR assay and/or molecular characterization.
of "P. knowlesi" in humans include headache, fever, chills and cold sweats.
showed clinical symptoms in 94 patients with single species "P. knowlesi" infection at Kapit Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.
cycle of the parasite in humans and its natural host macaque is about 24 hours.
the disease may be called quotidian malaria, in concert with designation of tertian malaria and quartan malaria.
parasite causes non-relapsing malaria due to lack of hypnozoites in its exoerythrocytic stage.
infection with this organism is normally not serious, life-threatening complications or even death may occur in a minority of cases.
most common complications are respiratory distress, abnormal liver function including jaundice and renal failure.
knowlesi" infection is diagnosed by examining thick and thin blood films in the same way as other malarias.
morphology of "Plasmodium knowlesi" is similar to that of "Plasmodium malariae".
trophozoites stretching across the erythrocyte, called band forms, are sometimes observed.
diagnostic tests kits may or may not recognize "P. knowlesi" because of their specificity.
PCR assay and molecular characterization are the most reliable methods for detecting and diagnosing "P. knowlesi" infection.
identifies the parasite DNA but this technique is not rapid and cannot be used for routine identification.
with a severe and rapidly deteriorating condition should be treated aggressively and urgently as if were infected with falciparum malaria.
parasites were seen on the blood film and later identified as "Plasmodium knowlesi" by PCR.
spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells.
overall post mortem picture was very similar to that found in cases of "Plasmodium falciparum".
were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain.

analysts of Evangelical apologetics have dubbed his apologetic method as either a "combinationalist" or "verificational" approach.
second apologetic text, "A Philosophy of the Christian Religion", explored questions of value that are personally and existentially satisfying.
texts reflected his deep study and appreciation of the work of Søren Kierkegaard.
emphasised the meaning of authentic discipleship and commitment to the way of Christ as grounded in God's love.
graduating from Harvard, Carnell joined the faculty of the recently founded Fuller Seminary.
was attracted to this seminary as it was part of an emerging movement of reform within Protestant Fundamentalism.
background to this new movement of reform lies in the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century.
was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it remains true today.
the nineteenth century Evangelicalism had been the major expression of Protestant theology and church life in North America.
division comprised two broad camps: Liberal Christianity and Evangelical Christianity.
questioning of theism was not confined to abstract concerns in philosophy, but also developed as modern historical consciousness dawned.
Genesis narratives of the creation and Noah's Flood were brought into doubt, and the science versus religion debates accelerated.
new organization known as the National Association of Evangelicals was formed with the agenda of reforming society.
men were convinced that a two-pronged approach to societal transformation was possible.
other approach involved itinerant evangelistic preachers proclaiming the message at the grass roots level of society.
had grown up as a fundamentalist and been trained at Wheaton College, which was one of the bastions of fundamentalism.
was, however, dissatisfied with the anti-intellectual tendencies he discerned in fundamentalist culture.
was therefore very receptive to the message of Neo-Evangelicals who sought to reform both fundamentalism and the wider society.
fundamentalists feared that television was a device in the hands of the devil.
scorned the anti-intellectual tendencies in fundamentalism, and attacked its legalistic and negative mentality about culture.
attacked the legalism and hypocrisy he saw in fundamentalism and argued that it was "orthodoxy gone cultic".
highlighted what he saw as critical deficiencies in fundamentalist thought and practice.
a result of his published diatribe Carnell became the object of much criticism from fundamentalist preachers.
personal life was not without difficulties as he suffered from depression and insomnia, and received psychiatric treatment including electro-convulsive therapy.
treatment included doses of barbiturates, and he died in 1967 from a drug overdose.
legacy, however, is generally regarded as a positive contribution to the re-emergence of Evangelicals in scholarly pursuits.
apologetic contributions influenced the post-World War Two generation of evangelicals, and emphasized the importance of the gospel and culture.
component 3, often simply called C3, is a protein of the immune system.

humans it is encoded on chromosome 19 by a gene called "C3".
plays a central role in the activation of complement system.
these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
state plays a central role in modern society, and rightly so.
activation is required for both classical and alternative complement activation pathways.
form of C3-convertase, also known as C4b2a, is formed by a heterodimer of activated forms of C4 and C2.
is an anaphylotoxin and the precursor of some cytokines such as ASP, and C3b serves as an opsonizing agent.
I can cleave C3b into C3c and C3d, the latter of which plays a role in enhancing B cell responses.
B is then activated by factor D, to form Bb.
resultant complex, C3bBb, is called the alternative pathway (AP) C3 convertase.
the proteolytic component of the convertase, Bb, is removed by complement regulatory proteins having decay-accelerating factor (DAF) activity.
C3b is broken down progressively to first iC3b, then C3c + C3dg, and then finally C3d.
crystallographic structures of C3 have been determined and reveal that this protein contains 13 domains.
of C3 in the blood may be measured to support or refute a particular medical diagnosis.
example, low C3 levels are associated with Systemic Lupus Eritematosus
some types of kidney disease such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and shunt nephritis.
component 3 has been shown to interact with Factor H.
in C3 lead to generic infections, usually fatal to the newborn.

State Lehigh Valley is a commonwealth campus of Pennsylvania State University.
is located in Center Valley, outside of Allentown in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania, in the United States.
in 1912, Penn State Lehigh Valley is the oldest of Penn State's commonwealth campuses.
1912, Penn State opened its first permanent "branch school" in the attic of an elementary school in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
to provide professional training to employees, the Allentown Branch School offered evening courses in engineering.
University purchased a converted factory building at 725 Ridge Avenue in Allentown to house the "Allentown Center."
1990s brought considerable change and subsequent growth to the campus.
the campuses shared faculty and developed four-year baccalaureate degree programs in a number of disciplines.
Bethlehem site currently housed continuing education programs as well as the Elementary Education degree program classes.
2005 the University restructured across the state, and discontinued the Berks-Lehigh Valley College partnership.
additional 3,000 students participate each year in its continuing education programs.
State shared the facility with Lehigh Valley College until that school closed in December 2009.
new facility more than doubled the size of the building on the old campus.

escape is the loss of planetary atmospheric gases to outer space.
variation in kinetic energy among the molecules is described by the Maxwell distribution.
kinetic energy and mass of a molecule determine its velocity by formula_1.
is why hydrogen escapes from an atmosphere more easily than carbon dioxide.
if the planet has a higher mass, the escape velocity is greater, and fewer particles will escape.
distant body has a cooler atmosphere, with a range of lower velocities, and less chance of escape.
helps Titan, which is small compared to Earth but further from the Sun, retain its atmosphere.
atmosphere with a high enough pressure and temperature can undergo a different escape mechanism- "hydrodynamic escape".
it is possible to lose heavier molecules that would not normally be lost.
presence of a magnetic field thus deflects solar winds, preventing the loss of atmosphere.
this, the atmosphere of Venus is two orders of magnitudes denser than Earth's.
models indicate that stripping by solar wind accounts for less than 1/3 of total non-thermal loss processes.
ionized region in turn induces magnetic moments that deflect solar winds much like a magnetic field.
this region, called a bow shock, the solar wind is slowed to subsonic velocities.
interaction typically prevents solar-wind stripping from being the dominant loss process of the atmosphere.
relative significance of each process depends on planetary mass, atmospheric composition, and distance from the sun.
dominant non-thermal loss processes for Venus and Mars, two terrestrial planets neither with magnetic fields, are dissimilar.
dominant loss process for Venus'atmosphere is through electric force field acceleration.
electrons are less massive than other particles, they are more likely to escape from the top of Venus's ionosphere.
net positive charge, in turn, creates an electric field that can accelerate other positive charges out of the atmosphere.
important loss processes on Venus are photochemical reactions driven by Venus's proximity to the Sun.
relative to hydrogen, is not of sufficiently low mass to escape through this mechanism.
natural satellites in the Solar System have atmospheres and are subject to atmospheric loss processes.
and natural processes that increase atmospheric carbon are known as “flows.”
typically have no magnetic fields of their own, but orbit planets with powerful magnetic fields.
spends roughly half of its transit time outside of the bow-shock and being subjected to unimpeded solar winds.
escaped hydrogen maintains an orbit following in the wake of Titan, creating a neutral hydrogen torus around Saturn.
with the plasma cloud induces sputtering, kicking off sodium particles.
interaction produces a stationary banana-shaped charged sodium cloud along a part of the orbit of Io.
impact of a large meteoroid can lead to the loss of atmosphere.
a collision is energetic enough, it is possible for ejecta, including atmospheric molecules, to reach escape velocity.
occurs on Earth when water vapor condenses to form rain or glacial ice.
also occurs on Earth when carbon dioxide is sequestered in sediments, or cycled through the oceans.
dry ice caps on Mars are also an example of sequestration.
can also be sequestered by adsorption, where fine particles in the regolith capture gas which adheres to the surface particles.
is too large to lose a significant proportion of its atmosphere through Jeans escape.
current rate of loss is about three kilograms (3 kg) of hydrogen and 50 grams (50 g) of helium per second.
exosphere is the high-altitude region where atmospheric density is sparse and Jeans escape occurs.
most oxygen on Earth is bound as O, which is too massive to escape Earth by Jeans escape.
gravitational attraction of Earth's mass prevents other non-thermal loss processes from appreciably depleting the atmosphere.
Earth's atmosphere is two orders of magnitude less dense than that of Venus at the surface.
of the temperature regime of Earth, CO and HO are sequestered in the hydrosphere and lithosphere.
vapor is sequestered as liquid HO in oceans, greatly decreasing the atmospheric density.
the dominant“loss” mechanism of Earth's atmosphere is not escape to space, but sequestration.

elections were held in the Netherlands on 22 November 2006 following the fall of the Second Balkenende cabinet.
largest increase in seats was for the Socialist Party (SP), which went from nine to 25 seats.
new cabinet continued for five months as a care taker cabinet until the elections.
opposition had pressed for speedy elections because they were on a winning streak.
major issue in the campaigns was whether this improving economy was because of or in spite of the right-wing government.
the fall of the cabinet several new small right-wing parties announced that they would run.
of these parties either came out of the remains of Pim Fortuyn's Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) or the liberal VVD.
the period before the elections the small right was characterized by a chaos of secessions, new formations and party switches.
Rotterdam alderman Marco Pastors and member of parliament for the LPF Joost Eerdmans formed Eén NL.
Kraneveldt left the LPF, returned her seat to the party and joined the social-democratic PvdA.
the LPF announced that it would also run the next elections, under the name "Fortuyn".
prominent politicians announced they would step down before the elections.
the CDA, ministers Cees Veerman and Karla Peijs announced they would not return, as did state secretary Clemence Ross.
D66's current chairperson Lousewies van der Laan and her predecessor Boris Dittrich also announced they would not return.
Department of Defense in the mean time is demanding a rectification of the story published by De Volkskrant.
organisations launched a voting tool which helped voters to decide between the multitude of parties.
Institute for Public and Politics (IPP), a government agency, had the "Stemwijzer" (the "Voting-pointer").
Stemwijzer consisted out of thirty propositions like "Citizens should elect the Prime Minister."
voters could show their support for these propositions by clicking either "agree", "don't agree" or "don't know".
Stemwijzer had also been made for General, European, Provincial and Municipal elections since 1989.
voters could show their support for thirty six propositions on a five-point scale.
they show whether they thought the current cabinet had performed well.
Kieskompas showed users their attitude towards party leaders as competent and trustworthy.
stated which party was the closest to them and which party the farthest.
also gave them the possibility to see which coalition best matched their political preferences.
Freek de Jonge performed an'election show'('verkiezingsconference') on public television on the night before the elections.

parties had consciously kept their options open and expressed a preference for the composition of a new cabinet.
2004 and 2005, the polls indeed indicated that the united left could gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
November polls however showed that the CDA was gaining on and surpassing the PvdA.
polls indicated that the PvdA was bleeding votes to the SP while the CDA remained more or less stable.
left- and right-wing blocks remained in an equilibrium with neither side gaining enough votes for an overall majority.
centrist parties such as the ChristianUnion could play a decisive role.
debates were dominated by social-economic questions and especially the performance of the Balkenende cabinets.

CDA claimed that the reforms were finished and that the following cabinet would not have to take any serious measures.
VVD wanted to continue reforming to increase the performance of the Dutch economy.
PvdA and the GreenLeft however also announced that they wanted to reform part of the economy and welfare system.

and integration, which had dominated the 2002 and 2003 elections, were clearly less important during these elections.
right-wing parties, such as One NL and Party for Freedom, had campaigned extensively on the issue of immigration and integration.
said that the "Islamisation of the Netherlands" is a "tsunami" that needed to be stopped, "because it threatens our culture."
environment finally also became a secondary issue during the elections.
first attention to environmental issues was attracted by Greenpeace who interfered in the CDA party congress on 30 September 2006.

voting has been voluntary in the Netherlands since the elections of 1971, not all voters exercise their right to vote.
elections tend to draw between 70% and 90% turnout; the 2006 election drew a turnout of 80.1%.
order to get more of these seats two combined lists were formed.
the vast majority of people vote for the top candidate, however this is not always the case.

fixed operation, a controller has a set programmed time to service all movements every cycle.
controller will service all movements whether or not there is vehicle demand.
are three general ways for a traffic signal to operate, FREE, COORD, and FLASH operation.
COORD operation, short for coordination, the signal is running a background cycle length.
volume picks up again the signal switches back into either FREE or COORD operation.
are several basic timing functions that need to be programmed for the traffic controller to operate.
time determines the minimum duration of the green interval for each movement.
turns, minor streets, major streets, usually have different MIN times.
extension, or passage time determines the extendable portion of the green time for a movement.
movement remains in the extendable portion as long as an actuation is present and the passage timer has not expired.
Don't Walk is the duration of the flashing pedestrian clearance.
is timed as the length of the crosswalk divided by a speed of 3.5 feet per second.
Length controls the time from one major street green to the next major street green for purposes of coordination.
is often set by the master controller for the particular plan used.
is also used if the signal has no detectors attached.
timing can be set by the master controller for the particular plan used.
well coordinated signal system can enhance traffic flow, reduce delay and minimize pollution.

change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine's circumstances, you need a good reason.
participating peer node in BitVault architecture is a "Smart Brick", which is a trimmed down PC with large disks.
Smart Bricks in a BitVault system are connected by a high-bandwidth, low latency network.
stores immutable data objects, i.e., objects which cannot be changed.
physical location of the objects is not fixed and can be on any of the bricks.
location changes depending on its frequency of access; it can even be replicated at more than one brick.
DHT partitions the entire hash table into smaller hash tables.
bricks communicate using peer-to-peer technology, over the Membership and Routing Layer (MRL).
copies of a single object, called "replica", are stored in the BitVault system, to give enough redundancy.
any index is damaged, the nearest replica can be notified to start its repair.
if the index notices that the replica is damaged, it can initiate the repair of the replica.
method of error recovery is called the "Object Driven Repair" model.
MRL is also responsible to route messages to and from bricks and its associated DHTs.
MRL is implemented using an XRing architecture, which maintains a distributed routing table which facilitates one-hop routing.
brick architecture is divided into two parts– the Index Module and the Data Module.
IM is connected to a small Access Module, which serves as the gateway to external clients.
Check In requires the object, its key and an initial replication degree.
MRL routes the object and all its parameters to some brick.
the object has achieved the required replication degree, its index is said to be complete, otherwise it is partial.
brick must do further replication of an object which has partial index.
also periodically verify that the index of the object is still complete.
Out is the process of retrieving data from the BitVault system.
the brick doesn’t have the object, it passes the request on to other bricks, in parallel.
the brick has the object, it is retrieved from its Data Module and routed to the requestor.
transient failure will occur when a brick is experiencing temporary failure such as a software crash forcing a reboot.
parallel replication speeds up the repair of a damaged index to get it back to the complete state.
a new brick is added to the BitVault system, it takes up a random ID and contacts other bricks.
bricks will then include this new brick in their list of members.
newly added brick also gets a response from those bricks which added this to their membership list.
load balancing of the system kicks in to populate the new brick with live replicas.
periodically query other bricks about the load condition in them.
brick then transfers some replicas onto the low-load bricks to get a more or less balanced load on each brick.
also issues messages to other bricks to update their indices to reflect the change.

and avocados are the primary irrigated crops grown, and a significant area of land is used for cattle grazing.
population of the watershed is relatively small and the rate of growth low.
slow growth and low interest rates over the past two decades are emblematic.
limits growth, but low growth itself encourages corruption and makes it difficult to improve government effectiveness.

in 2015, this comprehensive plan proposed ways to improve the health and sustainability of the watershed.
research on prospective memory and retrospective memory has demonstrated that retrospective memory has a role in prospective memory.
was necessary to create more accurate terms in order to explain the relationship fully.
memory describes more accurately an experimental paradigm, therefore, the term prospective remembering was subsequently used.
double dissociation for the two has not been found, therefore concluding they are not independent entities.
example used in the reviews explains this in the following scenario:
basic information of the retrieval context includes time, location and objects, which in combination form the required retrieval context.
all the research this issue is still debatable within the scientific community.
research in this field looks at the phenomenon of mental time travel.
to this, it is certain that mental time travel requires central executive functioning, and most often a conscious ability.
new research has found many cases in which mental time travel occurs involuntarily without consciousness.
research shows this occurs for autobiographical events, and as a result these cases are more specific and detail oriented.
research has moved away from the retrospective portion and towards the prospective aspect of mental time travel.
episodic memory is the memory of moments from the past.
is frequently used in studies of Alzheimer patients and testing their dementia.
compared the effect of the disease on both prospective and retrospective memory.
this case the episodic memory being tested was the ability to remember the testing instructions.
test retrospective memory participants were presented with a list of nouns that had been divided into four categories.
autobiographical memory is recalling specific events from your own past.
of this type of memory has been used when researching the effect of emotion and context on memory.
and Henkel (2009) conducted a study looking at childhood events, context and metamemory.
wanted to see if the participants memory of remembering childhood events was accurate.
results showed that when context was recreated metamemory improved as did vividness of the actual event.
these topics, it is also used in studying mental time travel and age-related factors.
semantic memory refers to the collection of knowledge, meaning and concepts that have been acquired over time.
(2010) researched a pure mediated priming effect and wanted to discover which model accounted for it.
priming refers to the connection between two concepts that have a weak or no association with each other.
study shows pure priming has more applications than previously thought.
amnesia may cover events over a longer or only a brief period.
most common include Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, brain infection (such as encephalitis or meningitis), dementia, seizures, and stroke.
common causes include a brain tumor or psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, depression, criminal behavior, or psychogenic amnesia).
amnesia usually happens in close association with a stressful event that involves serious threat to life or health.
are two types of retrograde amnesia, one dealing with episodic memory, and one dealing with semantic memeory.
primary focus is on retrograde amnesia for specific, usually time-limited, knowledge.
study was conducted by Kesner (1989) on retrospective memory involving rats.
brain regions in the medial temporal lobe play a unique role in memory.
is also evidence that the medial temporal lobe automatically encodes memories.
role of the medial temporal lobe for retrospective memory was assessed by Okuda et al.
the medial temporal lobe displayed activation levels associated with prospective memories.
hippocampus plays an important role for remembering specific personal experiences in humans, as well as memory for sequence of events.
series of lesion studies assessed the role of the hippocampus on retrospective memory.
the first delayed response task, nonhuman primates were shown two food wells.
the primates to get a reward, they had to remember which food well was baited.
results showed that lesions to the hippocampus impaired performance on this task.
a variation of the study, the primates were required to approach the food well that was empty after a delay.
was found that damage to the thalamus also caused impaired performance on both tasks, but at longer delay intervals.
studies confirmed that damage to the hippocampus and thalamus impaired the recall for episodic memory of previously experienced events.
a lesion study involving rats, Ferbinteanu and Shapiro (2003) found the importance of the hippocampus for correctly remembering past events.
is known that the thalamus plays a crucial role in memory.
taxes play a crucial role in cutting the carbon emissions that cause climate change.
investigating stroke-patients with damage to the thalamus, Cipolotti et al.
found that the stroke victims had poor recognition and recall memory on verbal and non-verbal tests.
to the thalamus have been found to impair the recognition memory of monkeys.
researchers also suggested that combined damage to both regions of the thalamus can lead to amnesia.
amygdala plays a special role in that it is crucial to the emotional aspect of retrospective memory.
amygdala has been associated with memories for past emotional events.
number of studies have provided evidence that the amygdala acts as an intermediate for emotionally influenced memory.
studies have investigated lesions of the amygdala in animals and humans.
also found that emotional events (both pleasant and aversive) are better remembered than neutral events.
went on to find that the amygdala plays a crucial role for enhancing the strength of long-term and episodic memory.
PET, the amygdala was shown to be responsible for enhanced episodic memory in the recognition of emotional stimuli.
involve testing both prospective and retrospective memory; sometimes difficult to isolate one.
this study retrospective memory performance did not match retrospective memory scores on PRMQ.
infantile amnesia is an important, yet difficult area to study.
studies have tried and failed to determine the cause of this.
was found that older adults had lower retrieval for high specificity tests, but not for low specificity.
it was also found that the effects of divided attention on retrieval of younger adults mimicked the effects of aging.
retrieval efficiency depends on effortful, resource-demanding retrieval processes that is diminished in older adults.
we age, the ventricles in the brain get larger as our brains get smaller.
changes do not normally depend on total brain size, but rather which part of the brain is getting smaller.
frontal lobes usually shrink more quickly, and the temporal and occipital lobes are slower.
of neurons in the hippocampus (which plays a critical role in memory) are lost by the age of 80.
has also been found that dopamine levels decrease by 5–10% per decade.
neurotransmitter plays a critical role in neural cognition (decrease associated with Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease).
differences in memory performance have been observed between men and women.
series of experiments revealed that women did better at verbal episodic memory tasks (ex.
words, objects, pictures and everyday events), tasks with both verbal and visuospatial processing (ex.
the location of car keys), and tasks requiring little to no verbal processing (ex.
on the other hand, were better at purely visuospatial processing (ex.
of these differences may vary due to environmental factors such as education.
reaction to a very severe stressor is called post traumatic stress disorder.
sometimes leads to flashbacks and nightmares that cause people to re-live these traumatic events for long periods afterwards.
at life as we actually live it and the differences that emerge when recalling it.
goal was to discover if there are qualitative differences for remembering pleasant versus unpleasant events.
findings support the notion that unpleasant events have a stronger impact on our recall.
brain injury happens when the head suffers from a sharp blow, or suddenly accelerates or decelerates.
traumatic amnesia typically resolves itself gradually, however it will leave a mild, but permanent deficit in the patient's memory.
to certain areas of the brain may lead to cognitive and memory deficits– see Neuroanatomy section above.
damage was speculated to be axonal damage to serotonergic cells while cell bodies remained intact.
damage is at least partly responsible for the commonly found reduced verbal memory in users.
results have been found by many studies that have looked at brain anatomy in frequent marijuana users.
goal is to determine whether or not marijuana has any effects on cognitive abilities (including memory).
that there are in fact anatomical differences between the brains of frequent marijuana users and non-using control samples.
users showed a lower magnitude of activity (but no structural changes) in parahippocampal regions.
when subject to associative memory tasks, users performed within normal ranges.
is still a controversial issue, and more research is required to draw conclusive results.
disease accounts for 60 to 70 percent of cases of dementias.
is caused by a severe thiamine (vitamin B) deficiency due to chronic alcoholism or malnourishment.
thiamine dificiency can lead to symptoms such as: confusion, loss of balance, drowsiness, and some specific problems with vision.
the deficiency is considered severe, the memory loss may be accompanied by agitation and dementia.
standard treatment is intravenous thiamine, administered as soon as possible after symptoms become apparent.
the treatment does not correct the condition and recovery is known to be gradual and sometimes incomplete.
following are some examples relating to retrospective memory (or lack thereof):
was forwarded to the monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings without any action being taken on it.
had converted to Quakerism and had been imprisoned several times for his beliefs.
them was Francis Daniel Pastorius, a young German born near Würzburg to a family of elite officeholders.
1681, Penn invited people from his native England and from other European countries to the new colony.
town merchants traded with the largely Quaker colony of West Jersey.
October, 1683, thirteen German-Dutch families from Krefeld in the Rhine valley arrived with their own land claim.
upon a chance to create a viable German-speaking town, Pastorius negotiated with Penn to combine the two claims.
required land good for tilling because the emigrants would need to grow their own food to survive.
and Penn became good friends, and they often discussed plans for the new settlement over dinner.
was thus founded along a Lenni Lenape trail four miles (6 km) north of Philadelphia, between the Wissahickon and Wingohocking creeks.
became a separate and self-sufficient town of Dutch and German speakers.
Pastorius, they were not wealthy, but were skilled craftsmen who knew they would have to work hard for a living.
the first year they cleared land and planted crops for food and flax for weaving.
set up looms and soon were producing linen cloth that sold widely throughout the colonies.
serfdom was abolished in northwestern Europe by 1500, servitude was ubiquitous in Europe, sometimes under harsh conditions.
were widely owned in the colonies and local slave markets made purchasing slaves easy.
slave trade was protected by the British crown and some thought it necessary for economic growth in the colonies.
was justified by racism and intolerance towards what many British saw as "uncivilized" cultures.
ship owners and captains made large profits carrying slaves from Africa to the Caribbean islands and the mainland colonies.
in several ways they felt themselves outsiders, which allowed them to see and question what the English could not.
1686 a Quaker Meetinghouse was constructed near the current site of Germantown Friends Meeting.
and indentured servants were a valuable asset for a farmer because they were not paid.
1688, five years after Germantown was founded, Pastorius and three other men petitioned the Dublin Quaker Meeting.
argues that every human, regardless of belief, color, or ethnicity, has rights that should not be violated.
the petition the reference to the Golden Rule is used to argue against slavery and for universal human rights.
first reading, the argument presented in the petition seems indirect.
is the Meeting specifically asked to condemn the practice of slavery.
doing so, it arguably was very successful, but it would be easy to miss the sophistication of their argument.
the Caribbean colonies there had been many slave revolts over several decades, so the possibility was real.
logic strengthened the newly defined universal rights, which applied to all humans, not just the "civilized".
petition has several examples of such counter-intuitive but forceful arguments to push the slave-owning reader off his balance.
petition contains several points of difficulty for the reader unfamiliar with history.
that period up to 20,000 captured Christians were said to be kept as slaves in Algiers.
the Barbary pirates were renegade individuals from Europe including England and Holland.
petition's mention of this point, then, is another example of their sophisticated reasoning.
in the year that the Petition was written, a number of Quakers were enslaved in Morocco.
analogy in the first paragraph of the petition cast the taking of slaves by the English in a questionable light.
four men were claiming that slaves had social and political equality with ordinary citizens.
the petition refers to the black slaves as "negers", which was a German and Dutch word meaning black or negro.
its 1688 usage the term was simply descriptive and not in any way derogatory.
the petition the four men show respect for enslaved people and declare them equals.
minutes of London Yearly Meeting do not mention the petition directly, apparently skirting the issue.
practice of slavery continued and was tolerated in Quaker society in the years immediately following the 1688 petition.
of the authors continued to protest against slavery, but for a decade their efforts were rejected.
three decades passed before another Quaker petition against slavery was written with sophistication comparable to the Germantown 1688 petition.
the Germantowners'condemnation of slavery continued, and their moral leadership on the issue influenced Quaker abolitionists and Philadelphia society.
of the Quaker abolitionists published their articles anonymously in Benjamin Franklin's newspaper.
1776 a proclamation was written by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting banning the owning of slaves.
1688 petition was the first American document of its kind that made a plea for equal human rights for everyone.
conservator Morgan Zinsmeister removed previous repairs and reduced centuries of old and discolored adhesives with various poultices and enzymatic solutions.
and discoloration in the paper were reduced through aqueous treatment.
were made with acrylic-toned Japanese papers that were carefully applied to bridge the voids.
the petition was photographed at high resolution and then encapsulated along its edges(not laminated) between sheets of inert polyester film.
the 1688 petition is for many a powerful reminder about the basis for freedom and equality for all.
minorities and women of many third-world countries are especially vulnerable.
the poorest countries, especially, women make up the fabric of society.
that are sometimes called "advanced" are to some extent dependent on cheap labor and resources taken from those less fortunate.

history of Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, can be traced to the founding of a trading post by E.T.
on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901.
gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post.
November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks.
1968, the vast Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was discovered in Alaska's North Slope.
archaeological site excavated on the grounds of the University of Alaska Fairbanks uncovered a Native camp about 3,500 years old.
evidence gathered at the site, archaeologists surmise that Native activities in the area were limited to seasonal hunting and fishing.
addition, archeological sites on the grounds of nearby Fort Wainwright date back 10,000 years.
within Alaska but away from Fairbanks date to the time of the Bering Land Bridge more than 13,000 years ago.
July 1897, the first news of the Klondike gold strike reached Seattle, Washington, triggering the Klondike Gold Rush.
of people boarded steamships heading north to the gold fields.
who intended to establish a trading post at Tanacross, Alaska, where the Valdez-Eagle Trail crossed the Tanana River.
hired the steamer "Lavelle Young" to transport him and his supplies, and they began their trip upriver in August 1901.
turning into the Tanana from the Yukon, the steamboat ran into low water.
venturing upstream several miles, the boat reached an impassable point.
therefore unloaded Barnette's cargo on August 26, 1901, with an irate Barnette assisting.
traded for furs, then traveled to Valdez via dog team with his wife and three other men.
mountain pass they traveled through was later named Isabel Pass in honor of Barnette's wife.
Barnette traveled upriver with the "Isabelle", he met Judge James Wickersham in St. Michael.
was the judge for the federal Third Judicial District, which stretched from the North Slope to the Aleutian Islands.
was impressed with Barnette and his plan to establish a trading post at Tanacross.
suggested Barnette name his settlement Fairbanks, after Charles W. Fairbanks, the senior Senator from Indiana.
man could pick a set amount of space, which was marked with posts at each corner, hence "staking" the claim.
they also recorded their claims with Barnette, most men also reported their claims at the official office in Circle.
maximize his gain, Barnette had power of attorney for several relatives in Ohio.
of Pedro's discovery spread during the months that followed Barnette's arrival in September 1902.
January 1903, Barnette's cook, Jujiro Wada, arrived in Dawson City with word of the gold find.
Barnette's trading post, town lots were claimed for $2.50 apiece, and there was fierce competition for the choicest spots.
speculation was fierce in Chena, where claims were frequently stolen and had to be enforced with firearms.
vary, but historians estimate that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men arrived in the Tanana Valley.
put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand.
objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food.
gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down.
responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise.
afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.
asked Cleary to name the two main streets in town Cushman and Lacey, after U.S.
Francis W. Cushman of Washington and John F. Lacey of Iowa.
estimated 500 people in town, and another count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six saloons, and no churches.
spring arrived, Wickersham published the first newspaper in the settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter.
even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area.
left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City.
June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling for as little as $10.
fall 1903, the flood of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks.
gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it.
Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble discovered what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska.
extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold.
gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley.
Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley.
vote passed, and Barnette was sworn in as the city's first mayor on the next day.
used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family.
1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand.
production increased from $40,000 in 1903 to $600,000 in 1904 and $6 million in 1905.
expansion and the accompanying rise in population drove further productivity.
month earlier, two Catholic priests built the town's first church, Immaculate Conception Church.
in 1904, construction of a railroad began in Fairbanks and Chena, its downstream neighbor.
of the Tanana Mines Railroad (later the Tanana Valley Railroad) was finished to Fairbanks on July 17, 1905.
new banks opened in 1905, as did the city's first greenhouse, and a new $10,000 bridge across the Chena River.
river rose, flooding the town, and the bridge had to be dynamited to halt the flood.
next year, a fire destroyed most of Fairbanks, and the damage was estimated at $1.5 million.
town was quickly rebuilt, and the town's first hospital, St. Joseph's, was built on the north bank of the Chena.
1907, Barnette's bank was forced to temporarily close due to the Panic of 1907 and legal troubles.
schools were built on the north side of the Chena River, which was separate from town.
1909, Fairbanks gold production peaked at more than $9.5 million.
town saw its first library open that year, and the "Fairbanks Daily News-Miner", the city's longest-lived newspaper, began publishing.
Fairbanks, the common belief was that Barnette had embezzled money from the bank.
he was found guilty of only one of 11 charges against him, Barnette had a poor reputation in Fairbanks.
years afterward, Fairbanks newspapers referred to any robbery as "Barnetting" the subject.
accusations against Barnette were big news in a town that had little crime.
was restricted to a district separated from the rest of town by a wooden fence.
"line," as it was known, operated until the 1950s with the tacit approval of city authorities.
1911, the Fairbanks Commercial Club, a group of businesses, created the slogan "Fairbanks, Alaska's Golden Heart."
that year, Fairbanks boasted a population of more than 3,500 people, making it the largest city in Alaska.
more people lived in mining camps outside the city itself.
1910 marked the beginning of a decline in Fairbanks'fortunes.
year, less than $6 million in gold was produced—two-thirds the total of the previous year.
1911, production was half what it had been in 1909.
1918, it was ten percent of what it had been nine years before.
decline in production caused businesses to go out of business.
that sold to miners closed, as did those that supported the mines directly.
War I caused a further decline as the town's young men were drafted and sent overseas.
years after that remark, the U.S. Congress appropriated $35 million for construction of the Alaska Railroad system.
1917, the Alaska Railroad purchased the Tanana Valley Railroad, which had suffered from the wartime economic problems.
school was thought up by James Wickersham, who had risen to become Alaska's delegate to Congress.
1915, Wickersham gained approval of a bill funding the college from the 63rd United States Congress.
July 4, 1915, acting "without the authority of law," he laid the cornerstone for the school.
site for the school was directly north of the U.S.
Experimental Station (Tanana Valley), an experimental farm created by Charles Christian Georgeson in 1907.
farm was a project by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explore the agricultural potential of Interior Alaska.
1916, one year after the founding of the University of Alaska, the experimental farm employed 20 people.
mining declined in the Fairbanks area, some miners turned to homesteading.
the Homestead Act, many miners applied for grants of land from the federal government and established farms around the city.
1919 survey by the U.S. Geological Survey identified 94 homesteads within six miles of Fairbanks.
in the area was spurred by food and fodder shortages during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916.
Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming.
also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success.
these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success.

1925, the territorial legislature authorized the spending of up to $40,000 per year on airfield construction.
that year and 1927, more than 20 airfields were built.
of Fairbanks'location halfway between New York City and Tokyo, it became a crucial stop on the first around-the-world flights.
Post's 1933 solo circumnavigation stopped in Fairbanks, as did Howard Hughes'1938 effort.
1920, the first flight from the continental United States to Alaska used Fairbanks as a base.
reality, the bombers flew photographic missions intended to scout locations for military airfields to be built in the territory.

construction began in summer 1939, a few days before Germany invaded Poland to start World War II.
first runway was finished in September 1940, and the base was dedicated then, before most of the buildings were complete.
the first winter after the dedication, soldiers practiced flying and servicing aircraft in subzero weather conditions.
than 1,000 workers, most of whom were hired from outside Alaska, worked on the project through 1941.
these outside workers, the construction effort caused unemployment to almost vanish in Fairbanks, causing a large demand for labor.

massive Lend-Lease effort required additional facilities to be built in and near Fairbanks.
professors also contributed to the war effort with specially created Russian language classes.
airmen were regular customers of Fairbanks stores, and they bought large amounts of consumer goods unavailable at home.

civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university.
helipad was set up in a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees.
plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees.

de Silencio" was criticized for failing to match the highly regarded novel on which it was based.
novel written by Martín Santos has a labyrinthine fragmented structure and an ironic narrator.
has been described as "a novel written by an intellectual, about intellectuals and intended to be read by intellectuals".
de Silencio" was released on a region 2 DVD on June 19, 2007.
extras include an interview with director Vicente Aranda and actors Imanol Arias and Juan Echanove.
Italian crested newt ("Triturus carnifex") is a species of newt in the family Salamandridae.
carnifex" is found in parts of the Balkans and Italy.
is an aquatic breeder that can spend up to four months in the water.
location of the ponds where they breed affects the time when "T. carnifex" enters the water.
carnifex" prefers living in deep water since it is a nektonic species: it swims freely and is independent of currents.
typically prefer ponds in northern Europe, where temperatures are colder.
"T. carnifex" start to arrive between February and May, and leave between July and October.
warmer ponds, adult newts arrive within a month and leave during a two-week period in July.
altitudes, where temperatures begin to decrease, have a direct effect on the size of "T. carnifex".
discovered that living in colder temperatures resulted a body size increase in both male and female.
carnifex" is poikilothermic and larger body sizes help to reduce heat fluctuations.
also found that fluctuations in body temperature of T. carnifex decreased when body size increased.
interference has dramatically changed the habitat of "T. carnifex" due to the expansion of industrial areas and urban centers.
results in a fragmentation of natural landscapes, which leads to selective extinction, genetic drift, and inbreeding from isolation.
fish to isolated wetland habitats also leads to a decline of amphibians because of predation on newt larvae.
carnifex" is a pond-dwelling species of salamander that has adapted to living in temporary or polluted ponds.
a result, adult newts in the genus Triturus have multiple ways to respire.
three methods of oxygen intake are via the skin (the primary source), lungs, and buccal cavity.
is due to their poorly vasculated, elastic, simple lung structures, although the lungs are more vasculated at the posterior end.
oxygen-poor environments, such as stagnant ponds, pose a threat to the survival of larval newts.
consequently have external gills at birth that persist until metamorphosis, which assists survival in low-oxygen conditions.
are numerous secondary filaments along with the main filaments, which are lengthened to extend the oxygen-catching capability.
increase in surface area counteracts the decreased oxygen available, by allowing greater oxygen uptake.
larval stages, the gills are well-developed with a great number of respiratory lamellae.
adaptation is hypothesized to be an advantage in response to the conditions in an aquatic environment.
the gills, there are neuroepithelial cells, which are important for sensing oxygen during developmental and adult stages.
suggests that they retain water, another saying that it secretes mucus.
it uses mostly cutaneous respiration as an adult, which enables it to thrive.
are still other adaptations that enable the newts to survive.
carnifex" have made physiological adaptations that enable them to stay in hypoxic conditions or meet their increased metabolic needs.
compensation is in the larvae as soon as they are born.
size can increase as the temperature declines for adults– in larvae, there is no dramatic change in spleen size.
adaptations have evolved due to both the environment and the physiological conditions the newt finds itself in.
can be seen when the animal releases red blood cells into the bloodstream as a method of maintaining oxygen levels.
feature is commonly shared among amphibians, and it is possible that all ectotherms are capable of this.
the category of ectotherms, "T. carnifex" is a heterothermic animal, meaning its internal temperature varies with differing climatic temperatures.
mechanism causes the newt to adapt to the changing temperatures by the increase of liver pigmentation in the winter months.
pigment cells play an important role in scavenging ions and free radicals in the newt, including the uptake of oxygen.
the winter months, the newt enters a state of hibernation, its respiratory rate slowing, the amount of oxygen intake decreasing.
increase of these liver pigment cells allow for storage of oxygen, as well as other important ions and free radicals.
is very susceptible to slight changes in its environment, and is thus considered an ideal bio-indicator species.
this way, the larval newt is exposed to any contaminants present in the water from the moment of its birth.
is also genotoxic, meaning it builds up in the kidneys and liver, thus accumulating in the food chain.
allows them to adapt and moderate environmental changes in their habitats.
can affect "T. carnifex"'s respiration by an interaction with the cardiovascular compartment of the newt.
is mainly seen by the metabolic changes that occur with altering temperatures.
there is an increase in temperature, metabolic rate will increase, as will the heart rate.
occurrence will cause the need for higher intake of oxygen.
an oxygen-low environment, the organism will need to undergo splenic activity in order to remain oxygenated.
the newts enter a hypoxic environment, their spleen will decongest to allow erythrocytes out and into blood stream.
process will increase hemoglobin in the blood, and therefore the oxygen-carrying capacity.
this has occurred, "T. carnifex" are able to survive in oxygen poor environments.
this difference will change how the newt deals with changes in its respiratory conditions.
developmental change is the loss of external gills from juvenile stage to adulthood.
heart of "Triturus carnifex", like that of most amphibians, consists of two atria and one ventricle.
do not have a coronary artery on the ventricle, due to circulation that is found in the conus arteriosus.
contain a special circulatory adaptation that allows them to survive ventricular penetration.
flow physics are determined by certain formulas which can be used to find specific values.
Law, Pouseuille’s Law, and the Law of Bulk Flow all are necessary to find values of the cardiovascular system.
volume is a factor necessary for function and survival of an organism.
circulatory system has many functions, such as bringing necessary substances throughout the body and distributing them where needed.
function is the providing of hydraulic pressure to certain organ systems in the organism.
process will affect many aspects of the system, including the composition and volume of the blood.
surroundings include both the environment, and the physiological conditions the newt finds itself in.
such instance of this regulation is known as compensatory respiration, found during hypoxia.
happens when there is an extremely low or limited amount of oxygen available to an organism.
compensatory phenomena, many factors of an animal may become subject to change.
of these is the blood volume, which can vary anywhere from 6-8.5ml/100g of body weight.
"T. carnifex", respiration in the lungs is not nearly as important as the cutaneous compartments.
research has taken place with anesthetized "T. carnifex", and under these circumstances cutaneous respiration is the sole method of breathing.
amphibians the increase in catecholamines can cause high blood sugar because of stimulation of the liver and muscles.
colder the temperature, the harder it seems for "T. carnifex" to reach this 4000 beat minimum.
implies that in these conditions, the spleen is very congested.
release of oxygen from the spleen is unnecessary and not triggered.
opposite is seen when the animal is placed in a hypoxic environment.
is a release of erythrocytes from the spleen and the values in the blood are raised to high.
blood volume, a factor affecting blood pressure is the temperature.
lower temperatures, the newts will have a lower blood pressure, and the opposite is true for a higher temperature.
congestion of the spleen rises, the pressure will fall; and vice versa.
there is a decrease in blood at 18 degrees, the spleen is still emptied (as it is at any temperature).
well oxygenated environments, temperature can be seen working alone, without the added challenge of a hypoxic environment.
an increase in temperature occurs in the surrounding environment of a newt, this increases metabolic activity.
is to assist with the greater need for consumption of oxygen.
the blood plasma will decrease and prevent an increase in blood pressure.
terms of compartmentalization of the newt’s respiratory systems, the systemic (lungs) and cutaneous (skin) systems work and function independently.
this, there is a very high correlation between the two with respect to their abilities in times of hypoxia.
systems attempt to obtain as much oxygen as possible– cutaneous through vasodilation, and systemic through splenic decongestion.
will exhibit features associated with a process known as“aging”.
involves dropping elements that are less mature from the circulatory compartment.
are other decreases seen in these cells, and these include enzymatic activity.
it is necessary for some supplementation of this, the liver increases in activity during this period.
is as if there is a shift in responsibility from the haemopoietic cells to the liver.
is a high correlation between increased activity of the liver and decreased myelopoietic activity.
in metabolic activity could be due to the low motility or movement of newts during winter.
most basic aspect iof the heart s the cardiovascular compartment’s ability to facilitate and maintain circulation.
structures of the heart play a vital role in its ability to do this.
of the heart is due to the electrical stimuli (signals) that are received from the central nervous system in organisms.
specific to amphibian hearts, the capacity to regenerate is actually higher than many animals, humans included.
evidence of regeneration is seen in the production of DNA.
the presence of mitotic figures seen defines division and creation of new cells.
short, where the damage occurs is directly related to how much regeneration will occur.
are broad generalizations relating to amphibians that can be used to describe their digestive processes.
such generalization is that digestion raises metabolic rate in the organism in which it is occurring.
is similar to the shunting of blood flow to the gastrointestinal compartments, as seen in muscular exercise.
the similarities end at the surface and underlying mechanisms between the two processes differ.
is demonstrated by an increase of the concentration of HCO3 in the blood.
another example of regulation as opposed to conformation in the Italian crested newt.
height of metabolic change is directly proportional to how much food is consumed by the newt.
important note regarding the heart of the newt is that it possesses an incomplete separation between the two sides.
is not ideal, as it makes it possible for oxygen rich blood and oxygen poor blood to mix.
of this, the physiology of newts attempts to avoid mixing.
of the circulatory system can alter with the different environments "T. carnifex" finds itself in.
requirements of the blood compartment will change when the environment of the animal tampers with the blood’s oxygen-carrying capabilities.
movement of oxygen molecules into the tissues of the newt from the surrounding medium occurs in two distinct stages:
example of this difference is seen in the response to hypoxia between organisms at differing developmental stages.
juvenile newts, there is no cardiovascular response in conditions of hypoxia.
carnifex" displays a unique hemoglobin and red blood cell (RBC) adaptation in their circulatory system.
extra proteins were produced in high concentrations in early RBC, but decrease quickly as the cell matures.
found that although hemoglobin production decreases as the RBC matures, the cell creates more protein to aid in hemoglobin production.
carnifex" is likely to develop in areas of varying temperatures and changing oxygen availability.
with developmental changes, "T. carnifex" will undergo a coupling of many processes as it eases into adulthood.
of these processes include the metabolic needs of different tissues, cardiac activity, and respiratory procedures such as gas exchange.
coupling will be achieved by the autonomous nervous control system.
nervous system assists in development of cardiovascular functions, but this change will occur much later in life.
time there is a switch from one type of respiration (e.g.
there will be a required alteration and modification of the circulatory system.
increase that comes with development is that of blood pressure.
this is not true for the larval and embryonic stages of "T. carnifex".
many changes will have to occur for the organism to reach the mechanisms it contains as a fully developed animal.
the heart (and related structures) is the first organ to operate functionally.
of mechanisms in "T. carnifex" is vital in understanding how the organism will function as a whole.
includes the development of the organism, and why and how it develops in the manner that it does.
response will demonstrate the extent to which neurohormonal instruments are at work operating in the cardiovascular system.
pressure in response to hypoxia will go up in adults, but will not follow this pattern in younger organisms.
adulthood, this extent will be much larger in comparison to juveniles.
early development, it is possible (but not proven) that cardiac receptors have an influence on the regulation of blood pressure.
in the cardiovascular system is often due to hormonal changes, or the innervation within the system.
do this through induction to changes in metabolism and ion regulation.
of these stressors and stimulus that must be neutralized come from the environment of the Italian crested newt.
carnifex" lives in an open aquatic environment relatively close to human activity, which makes it prone to sewage leakages.
is noted that the absorption of the direct environment is a daily part of "T. carnifex"'s life.
environments have been known to sometimes receive the previously discussed sewage leaking.
compounds nonylphenol as well as ethoxylate surfactants can be found in polluted rivers, where the newts reside.
two substances discussed can be transformed, by microorganisms, into compounds which are much more toxic.
are extremely good bioindicators, due to the magnification of these chemicals in the environment demonstrated in the newt.
mitochondria, there is a multitude of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm.
droplets assist in the movement of substances across the integument.
negative effect of the chemical nonylpheno, a decrease in the presence of lipid droplets, can be observed in the cytoplasm.
are vital to the level of permeability that the skin has.
is very low in October to November, then peaks in January.
are low in September to November, and rise to a maximum from December to April.
there is a steady decrease lasting from May until July.
experiments allowing newts to be exposed to nonylphenol, there was a decrease in corticosterone and aldosterone.
steroidogenic and chromaffin tissues have an effect on them deriving from the exposure.
being said, it is possible that experimentally this situation could arise.
this hypothetical environment, similar mechanisms to marine fish would be employed.
the terrestrial environment, there will be a change to the integument that will directly affect osmoregulatory mechanisms.
change is the shift from a smooth, mucosal skin surface to one that is rough and dry.
change is to allow easier transport of water through the cutaneous membrane and into the newt to allow for hydration.
experiments, it was discovered that dehydrated newts were prone to a loss of motor control.
only 22% water weight loss, newts in the aquatic phase lost their ability to remain upright and mobile.
after adaptation to a terrestrial phase, they could lose 30% before a loss of motor control was recorded.
is an indication of how vital water levels are to the function of "T. carnifex".
uptake will also show a change between the two phases.
water loss or gain and ion transport go hand in hand when discussing osmoregulation in "T. carnifex".
phase newts will show a near doubling of sodium movement into the newt, which is said to be unidirectional.
large uptake in correlation with the terrestrial phase will indirectly increase the transport of water across the epithelium.
aquatic newts will undergo a loss of ions through diffusion across the surface of the body.
phase newts, on the other hand, face an alternate issue with water loss.
important equation to apply to the ion and water movement into "T. canifex" is that of Hertz’s convection-diffusion equation.
it was discovered that a lowering of fluid absorption from external environments is shown in the presence of serosal bumetamide.
is one structure, aquaporin, that above all else proves most significant for the water transport across a membrane.
though osmosis is being mainly discussed, this is just one of a few tactics for transporting water.
other tactics being referred to are known as isosmotic transport.
can be described as water being able to flow in bulk minus the motivating epithelial forces.
transport is, however, dependent on the active transport of sodium.
important equation to assist in determination of values having to do with osmoregulation is Heff’s equation.
few other equations to assist with determining values in osmoregulation are volume flow per unit membrane:
of substances happens to the kidney’s proximal tube, the small intestine, skin, and glands.
is reasonable considering that there is a large number of sodium pumps on the lateral membranes of transporting epithelia.
equilibrium is reached at the transepithelial equilibrium, the water flow will be lumen into blood, according to Curran.
is what will couple water flow-in across the tight junction with active solute flow-in.
the Hertz convection-diffusion equation says much about the entering of water and solutes across a membrane.
is transported through principle cells, and Cl- is transported through mitochondria-rich cells.
Diamond-Bossert theory is a predominant model in terms of isosmotic transport.
speaks to a concentration gradient of 0 of the solute concentration gradient across the lateral intercellular space.
Law is of vital importance in explaining this model with regards to diffusion.
is critical here, and this can be maintained through anion flow throughout the involved cells.
last model of osmotic flow in "T. carnifex" is osmosensor feedback.
are two major factors that categorize epithelia that transport fluids.
are vital to determine which organs are doing what in an organism.
features are the transport that occurs when no external driving force appears, and the uphill transport of water.
sum up, sodium/potassium pumps can be found on the lateral membranes of fluid transport epithelia.
will be fluid in the lateral space that during osmosis will become hypoerosmotic with regards to the external environment.
Hertz convection-diffusion is instrumental in determining a direct analysis of the coupling between water and solute uptake.
is more than likely that epithelial cells contain osmotic sensors.
skin of "T. carnifex" is a highly permeable structure, because it is the source of osmoregulation.
to their skins'ability to absorb water, these newts do not need to drink.
first layer of cells contains three adaptive characteristics that help protect the epidermal layers.
inner portion of the integument consists of the connective tissue that makes up the dermis layers.
water is still able to get through the layers of the epidermis.
are especially important to the newt’s physiological well-being because they are responsible for the absorption of sodium ions.
highly permeable skin is a favourable adaption this is the main source of osmoregulation in crested newts.
skin also helps to limit water loss by the mucus and the intercellular spaces in the stratum corneum.
advantage of having thicker skin is that it helps prevent the organism from suffering an excessive loss of water.
is especially helpful since the crested newt goes through changes in its environment, depending on the season.
permeability was observed when in the terrestrial environment, which caused rapid rehydration.
is a suggestion that osmoregulation can be modified by hormonal or environmental factors.
plays a key role in the osmoregulation of the newt.
National Assembly plays a key role in attempting to improve governance in the country.
permeability is dependent on the release of hormones such as prolactin, vasotocin, as well as other thyroidal and internal hormones.
on a close relative of "T. carnifex" to determine the effects different environmental conditions have on the newts osmoregulatory systems.
winter months, prolactin is released into the circulatory system, which drives "T. carnifex" into the aquatic environment (Lodi 1981).
only does this hormone prompt a change of habitat for the newt, it reduces the active transport of sodium ions.
contrast to prolactin, which decreases osmotic permeability, vasotocin increases the permeability and is secreted during the summer months.
hormone is regulated by another major hormone– adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
vasotocin not only increases cutaneous water permeability, but promotes increased cutaneous blood flow.
these situations, kidney functions associated with water reabsorption do not make a large impact on the reduced output of urine.
winter, when the newt is in the aquatic phase, the skin’s osmotic permeability is highly reduced.
can be measured by observing a reduction in urine output.
terrestrial phase is characterised by an upkeep in high GFR and urine flow.
maintenance is associated with an increase in the permeability of the integument, which allows for quick re-hydration.
transepithelial potential– or TEP– of a newt's cell is upheld by the intake of sodium in vivo.
an experiment to observe the sodium permeability and saturation effect.
data suggest that the saturation of the sodium transport mechanism occurs at around 10mM.
phosphatase, an enzyme located in the proximal tubules, plays an important role in the polarization of membrane surfaces.
was also noted that the activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased, due in part to hypophysectomy.
summer, aldosterone creates an increase in enzymatic activity (Lodi et al.
will independently cause an increase in Na+ channels within the cutaneous membrane.
of many different species are often found congregating in ponds, therefore niche overlap is very common.
carnifex" has adapted a specialized niche, to avoid species competition.
metamorphosis, "T. carnifex" becomes roughly eleven times heavier than other smaller newt species in a specific pond.
when "T. carnifex" are placed in poorly oxygenized water, they switch their primary respiratory surface from skin to lungs.
means that they do not thermoregulate by internal forces, but rather adopt the temperature of the surrounding conditions.
can be either advantageous or problematic, depending on the situation.
of the phase-changes of "T. carnifex", there will be a large variation in the temperature of their surrounding environments.
means that it is necessary to use mainly behavioral mechanisms to survive in the changing temperature of their environments.
Italian crested newt can be classified as ectotherms due to their inability to internally regulate their temperature.
body temperature of "T. carnifex" is dependent on the temperature of the external environment.
have been studies that show that there will be a greater increase in body size in females.
means that the internal forces of this newt that control the body temperature have almost no importance.
are traditionally called“cold-blooded” although blood has really nothing to do with how these animals thermoregulate.
means that "T. carnifex" will regulate in a way that depends more on behavior.
there is a large range of environmental temperatures, newts are very insensitive to a thermal gradient profile.
are thermoconformers, which means they will acclimate to their surrounding environmental temperatures.
of this, there is an increase in the time allotted for thermoregulation.
predators are an issue for "T. carnifex", there will be a vulnerability associated with their presence.
larvae of newts are extremely vulnerable as they cannot defend themselves.
growth and development of these larvae will be largely dependent on these temperatures.
newts are developing, they go through a stage of metamorphosis.
that are in the metamorphosizing stage tend to prefer warmer temperatures than those in the stage following metamorphosis.
the larvae in this stage will undergo a much more precise thermoregulation process than those in the intermediate stage.
thermal environment of the terrestrial phase does produce many more daily fluctuations of temperature change than does the aquatic phase.
processes, such as digestion and locomotor activity, will result in a change in thermoregulation, specifically higher preferred body temperatures.
is true regardless of the activity level of the animal in question.
upward shift in the maternal body temperature will increase the rate of development.
temperature will influence a number of things: survival, body size, growth rate, and locomotor performance.
development is very important on the temperature of the surrounding water.
faced with a thermal gradient, reproducing females will show a preference for higher temperatures.
environmental temperatures are approximately 10-24 degrees Celsius from March to November, and 4-8 degrees Celsius from November to March.
temperatures of "T. carnifex" will closely resemble those of the surrounding environment.
is likely that this is all because estrogen induces a shift in the preferred body temperature.
carnifex" inhabits an aquatic environment much of the time, and this particular environment presents many thermoregulatory challenges.
deal with this, the Italian crested newt will use both thermoregulation and thermo-acclimation.
external environment is heterogeneous and must be dealt with in three ways: thermoregulation, thermal acclimation, and thermal sensitivity.
co-adaptational theory suggests that there is a combination of behavior and physiological compensations.
response will therefore change the benefit that is received from a particular body temperature.
is why "T. carnifex" will conform to the external temperature, instead of regulating internally.
these circumstances, the maintenance of body temperature will exist in a narrower range.
can modify their preferred body temperatures in response to the temperature change that comes with the altering seasons.
temperature will determine the equilibrium that is reached between the formation and disruption of factors (ex.
flexibility is a requirement of functionality for the fluid mosaic membrane that exists in animal cells.
top of this, temperature also determines the degree to which enzymes can act as catalysts.
carnifex" undergoes attempts in this domain to achieve this idea.
systematic state in "T. carnifex" will refer to multiple things going on in the physiology of the animal.
can be things like ionic distribution, alternative enzyme patterns, and differing metabolic patterns.
a specific temperature, a state can be achieved that can be called as“steady”.
defining factors are the specific concentrations, or turnover rates of bodily components.
components can be anything ranging from ionic concentration to the fluidity of the membrane.
drop in temperature will lower this number and physiological functions can come to a standstill.
adaptation will cause a rise in fluidity and a higher physical tolerance of the cells undergoing this temperature change.
the other hand, rises in temperature will likely result in the eventual denaturation of proteins within "T. carnifex".
is obviously an extreme problem, but even before that problems will arise.
denaturation, a rise in temperature will lead to an increase in permeability of the biological membranes.
temperatures produce limits on the lengths to which metabolism has the ability to change.
such basic law is that any change in Tb will be directly proportional to Ta.
other laws have more to do with the metabolic rate:
in "T. carnifex" can be affected by both metabolic and behavioral changes.
ectotherms will use behavioral adaptations to compensate for the wide variety in temperatures within their environments.
often select the temperature they prefer at a certain time of day in order to control their body temperatures.
when placed in an environment with a variation of temperatures, newts will use both behavioral thermoregulation and metabolic compensation.
newts alter the speed in which they dive between descents and ascents.
altering the behavior used as a larvae and when swimming, "T. carnifex" can effectively thermoregulate.
main organ involved in amphibians'heat loss and gain from the environment is their skin (Shoemaker, VH).
homeotherms, poikilotherms and ectotherms usually exhibit a thermal preference, although not quite in the same way.
consumption has normally been determined to be the most convenient and relevant measure of metabolic activity.
respond to variance in temperature by employing either behavioural or physiological changes.
changes in body temperature are unavoidable, however, depending on how much solar radiation is available.
has been debated whether a behavioral thermal adaptation is actually advantageous.
fact, some have decreed it to be an evolutionary inhibitor.
much speculation has been made for how preferred body temperature acclimation works, its significance has been mostly unexplored.

Russian device would therefore be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world.
veracity of Russia's claims concerning the weapon's size and power have been questioned by US defense analysts.
was successfully field-tested in the late evening of September 11, 2007.
new weapon is to replace several smaller types of nuclear bombs in its arsenal.
damage is inflicted by a supersonic shockwave and extremely high temperatures.
weapons differ from conventional explosive weapons in that they generate a longer, more sustained blast wave with greater temperatures.
doing so, they produce more damage over a larger area than a conventional weapon of similar mass.
comparison, the MOAB produces the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT from 8 tons of high explosive.
defense analysts question both the yield of the bomb and whether it could be deployed by a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber.
are also questions on what type of explosives it used.
questions if it was what some experts call a fuel-air explosive or if it was a thermobaric weapon.
says that the weapon depicted in the video appears to be a fuel-air explosive, based on its shape.
military analyst Sascha Lange speaking at "Deutsche Welle" pointed out multiple discrepancies of the released video and expressed his skepticism.
he does not necessarily believe is that the weapon is new.
says the Russians have possessed a range of thermobaric weapons for at least four decades.
says"These are fuel-air explosives, designed to generate intense blast pressure over a large area.
is reported that the Russian bomb is a so-called thermobaric bomb that produces both blast and heat.
Russian military has been a pioneer in the development and use of these thermobaric weapons.

cell lymphoma (MCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), comprising about 6% of NHL cases.
are only about 15,000 patients presently in the U.S. (The prevalence seems to be somewhat higher in men.)
cells generally over-express cyclin D1 due to a t(11:14) chromosomal translocation in the DNA.
diagnosis, patients typically are in their 60s and present to their physician with advanced disease.
half have either fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss (over 10% of body weight).
lymph nodes (for example, a "bump" on the neck, armpits or groin) or splenomegaly are usually present.
marrow, liver and GI tract involvement occurs relatively early in the course of the disease.
like most malignancies, results from the acquisition of a combination of (non-inherited) genetic mutations in somatic cells.
it is an acquired genetic disorder, MCL is neither communicable nor inheritable.
cells may also be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis, making them harder to cure with chemotherapy or radiation.
affected by MCL proliferate in a "nodular" or "diffuse" pattern with two main cytologic variants, "typical" or "blastic".
(aka "blastoid") variants have intermediate to large-sized cells with finely dispersed chromatin, and are more aggressive in nature.
may also replace normal cells in the bone marrow, which impairs normal blood cell production.
generally requires stained slides of a surgically removed part of a lymph node.
methods are also commonly used, including cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
chain reaction (PCR) and CER3 clonotypic primers are additional methods, but are less often used.
immunophenotype profile consists of CD5+ (in about 80%), CD10-/+, and it is usually CD5+ and CD10-.
cyclin D1 is expressed but it may not be required.
workup for Mantle cell lymphoma is similar to the workup for many indolent lymphomas and certain aggressive lymphomas.
is also a not-uncommon leukemic phase, marked by presence in the blood.
this reason, both the peripheral blood and bone marrow are evaluated for the presence of malignant cells.
endoscopy and neck CT scan may be helpful in selected cases.
some patients with the blastic variant, lumbar puncture is done to evaluate the spinal fluid for involvement.
scan- Computerized tomography scan yields images of part or whole body.
of radioactive glucose may give a false positive, particularly if the patient has exercised before the test.
overall 5-year survival rate for MCL is generally 50% (advanced stage MCL) to 70% (for limited-stage MCL).

thought is that given a long time, some non-blastic MCL transforms to blastic.
survival of most blastic patients is shorter, some data shows that 25% of blastic MCL patients survive to 5 years.
is longer than diffuse type and almost as long as nodular (almost 7 yrs).
microglobulin is another risk factor in MCL used primarily for transplant patients.
regimens are available and often get good response rates, but patients almost always get disease progression after chemotherapy.
relapse is typically more difficult to treat, and relapse is generally faster.
regimens are available that will treat relapse, and new approaches are under test.
of the aforementioned factors, many MCL patients enroll in clinical trials to get the latest treatments.

frontline treatment, CHOP with rituximab is the most common chemotherapy, and often given as outpatient by IV.
is becoming popular and showing promising results, especially with rituximab.
is showing better complete remissions (CR) and progression free survival (PFS) than CHOP regimens.
line treatment may include fludarabine, combined with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone, usually with rituximab.
and clofarabine are two other drugs being investigated in MCL.

of active immunotherapy include cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and immunotransplant, which combines vaccination and autologous stem cell transplant.
no active immunotherapies are currently a standard of care, numerous clinical trials are ongoing.
of ongoing clinical trials and further studies are required to improve our knowledge.
November 2013, ibrutinib was approved by the US FDA for treating MCL.
targeted agents include the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, mTOR inhibitors such as temsirolimus, and the P110δ inhibitor GS-1101.

main causes of deforestation in Ethiopia are shifting agriculture, livestock production and fuel in drier areas.
developing countries, especially in Africa, Ethiopia is exceptionally rich in history, as well as cultural and biological diversity.
is true for any country, but it is especially relevant for rich countries.
this rich cultural and natural heritage is threatened, especially in the form of deforestation.
populations are increasing deforestation which is leading the country to famine.
the population continues to grow, the needs of the people increase.
as populations grow and the need for energy increases, fragile ecosystems are threatened.
country has lost 98% of its forested regions in the last 50 years.
in Ethiopia play a big role in protecting erosion, as tree roots protect against washouts.
also help to keep water in the soil and reduce global warming by uptake of carbon dioxide.
forests have been very important for the livelihoods of the people of Ethiopia.
Ethiopian people used trees for lumber for construction, and to fuel their cooking fires.
also made traditional medicines from trees and other forest plants.
the growing need for forested lands, lack of education among locals has led to a continuing decline of forested areas.
trends estimated that in 2000 Ethiopia had 43,440 km² of natural forest area, which is 4% of its total land area.
to other East African countries Ethiopia’s deforestation rate is about average.
the deforestation rates in East Africa are second highest of the continent.
it has the smallest fraction of its forest area designated primarily for conservation.
from Northern Africa, East African countries show the second highest decline rates of conservation forests in the continent.
FAO (2007) estimated a deforestation rate of 1,410 km² per year.
analysis shows that the forested land declined to 1,907 km², which equals 67% of the forest cover in 1973.
2001 and 2005 another 55.4 km² of forest land were allocated for private coffee production and 20 km² for rubber plantations.
estimated the rate of deforestation between 1972 and 2000 using remote sensing techniques.
he could show that within the 28-year period 80% (400 km²) of the 1972 forest cover (489.24 km²) was lost.
describes that within the formerly closed forest, clearings created a speckled pattern of non-connected small forest patches.
with it will go the world’s only original wild populations of "Coffea arabica".
economic loss of that genetic resource ranges between 0.4 and 1.5 billion USD/year.
explains deforestation in the coffee forest area he studied by linking it to historical events in certain time periods.
period was characterized by resettlement and villagization programs and the expansion of state farm programs.
percent of forest loss was a result of converting 101.28 square kilometers of high forests into coffee plantations.
later periods forests continued to be converted to agro-forestry systems, agricultural land and settlement areas.
speed and pattern varies depending on the distance to state monitoring and coincides with changes in government.
the 1950s to 1974 private land ownership was promoted through land grants to civil servants and war veterans.
a result, large numbers of rural people were dislocated– also to forest areas.
transport and communication infrastructure and thereby better access to markets is facilitating deforestation.
forest cover change was detected close to areas with good road networks and around settlements.
a result of a political power vacuum during periods of political transition, large forest areas were cut down.
by food insecurity agricultural land is just more valuable to farmers.
afromontane rainforests of Southwestern Ethiopia are the world’s birthplace of "Coffea arabica" and harbor their last wild populations.
variability in their tolerance towards diseases and drought reflects the high genetic diversity of the wild coffee populations.
value has been estimated between 0.42 and 1.458 billion US$ a year.
about 5 billion kg of coffee per year are consumed in the importing countries.
houses have become popular and the specialty coffee market is booming.
suffer from poverty as well as food insecurity and cannot bear the costs of forest conservation.
and international stakeholders are involved in a competitive game for resources, rights and mandates.
also says that anybody who is willing to work the land has a right to obtain land without payment.
this goal can be enforced through land allocation, it almost certainly will conflict with land users'tenure security.
prohibits any person to use or harvest trees, settle, graze, hunt or keep bee hives in the state forest.
before the 2005 elections land certification continued also in other regions of Ethiopia.
results showed that certification has indeed improved tenure security and investments into land.
2000 a new approach to forest ownership and management was initiated with the help of international donor agencies.
so-called co-management approach builds on a contract between the government and communities which rely on forest management for their livelihood.
user groups are established and exclusive rights for forest use are granted to the members of the group.
contract confirms the boundaries of the forest, defines ownership and use and other specific conditions.
principal idea behind the co-management approach is that secured rights are a crucial incentive for sustainable management.
initial promising results, the sustainability of that approach still needs to be evaluated.
farmers have abandoned wild coffee collection when coffee prices were too low.
there is no scientific evidence that higher prices for forest coffee are an incentive for sustainable harvest practices.
fact, even the knowledge about the amount of wild coffee that can be collected in a sustainable way is scarce.
of the complex nature of the problem of deforestation, the Ethiopian government alone is not able to prevent deforestation.
now we also know that markets alone are unable to prevent this either.
of Ethiopia’s national budget is covered by international development aid.
surprisingly international aid agencies should also play a prominent role in sustainable forest management.
projects aim at developing forest management plans and signing contracts between local communities and the government.
rural areas, the government realized that if the deforestation continues the overall condition of the country will worsen.
any person cuts a tree, he or she needs to plant one to replace it.
current government and people are working hard together to make their country a better place.
are governmental and nonprofit groups working with the government to protect the land.
have now come to the realization that trees need legal recognition, and must be protected for future generations.

is a genus of positive-sense ssRNA viruses that contains one species: Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV).
has two host-dependent clades: one for raspberries; the other for grapevines.
are a significant agricultural burden, resulting in decreased yield and quality of crops.
has a synergistic relation with "Raspberry leaf mottle virus", with co-infection greatly amplifying the concentration of virions in infected plants.
virus is transmitted via pollination with RBDV-infected pollen grains that first infect the stigma before causing systemic infection.
is non-enveloped with an isometric protein coat about 33 nanometres in diameter.
the protein coat is the viral genome, which is bipartite, with the RNA strands referred to as RNA-1 and RNA-2.
first ORF encodes for a cell-to-cell movement protein, while the second ORF is expressed as a subgenomic RNA strand.
strand, RNA-3, is 946 nucleotides in length and encodes for the coat protein.
has been shown to not occur if RNA-3 is either not present or is sufficiently damaged.
into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell.
reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions has been developed to detect RBDV.
including reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase in the whole process, the procedure can be conducted in a single step.
tests are sensitive enough to identify the specific strain of the virus.
virus is not well adjusted to the chicken, and some strains of the virus "go berserk."
can be eradicated from infected plants by a procedure that first applies thermotherapy then cryotherapy to infected shoots.
heat to infected plants causes vacuoles in infected cells to enlarge, with these cells later being killed during cryotherapy.
either Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or Fe-ethylenediaminedi(o)hydroxyphenylacetic acid after cryotherapy stimulates regrowth and prevents chlorosis from developing in plant shoots.
this method, about 80% of shoots survive the initial heat therapy, with 33% surviving the cryotherapy and successfully regrowing.

is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through a bacterial fermentation-synthesis.
synthetic B is used to fortify foods and sold as a dietary supplement.
B consists of a class of chemically related compounds (vitamers), all of which show pharmacological activity.
other subtler kinds of vitamin B deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated.
B is used to treat vitamin B deficiency, cyanide poisoning, and hereditary deficiency of transcobalamin II.
is given as part of the Schilling test for detecting pernicious anemia.
cyanide poisoning, a large amount of hydroxocobalamin may be given intravenously and sometimes in combination with sodium thiosulfate.
are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements.
infants up to 12 months the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.4-0.5 μg/day.
for children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8 μg/day.
the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.

most cyanobacteria, including "Spirulina", and some algae, such as dried Asakusa-nori ("Porphyra tenera"), pseudovitamin-B is found to predominate.
B deficiency can potentially cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system.
levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and poor memory may be experienced.
B deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.
B is rare from plant sources, so vegetarians are most likely to suffer from vitamin B deficiency.
are at a higher risk of vitamin B deficiency if they were born to vegetarian mothers.
elderly who have diets with limited meat or animal products are vulnerable populations as well.
B is a co-substrate of various cell reactions involved in methylation synthesis of nucleic acid and neurotransmitters.
of the trimonoamine neurotransmitters can enhance the effects of a traditional antidepressant.
the plasma concentration of homocysteine falls as the intracellular concentration of vitamin B rises.
a deficiency in vitamin B may impact the production and function of those neurotransmitters.
B is found in most animal-derived foods, including fish and shellfish, meat (especially liver), poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products.
bioavailability from eggs is less than 9%, compared to 40% to 60% from fish, fowl and meat.
NIH fact sheet lists a variety of animal food sources of B.
fortified with B are also dietary sources of the vitamin.
for which B-fortified versions are widely available include breakfast cereals, soy products, energy bars, and nutritional yeast.
vitamin can also be a prescription product via injection or other means.
2003 study found no significant difference in absorption for serum levels from oral versus sublingual delivery of 0.5 mg of cobalamin.
there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries.
pernicious anemia can be treated entirely by the oral route.
amount of cyanide (20 µg cyanide in a 1,000 µg cyanocobalamin tablet) is less than daily consumption from food.
such cases B is thought to be only a marker for disease, and not a causal agent.
acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver disease can also be accompanied by an increase in circulating cobalamin.
cobalamin levels are one of the diagnostic criteria for the latter two diseases.
of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a dimethylbenzimidazole group.
the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.
hydrogenases and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.
of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B is made, must be synthesized by bacteria.
of B because it can be metabolized in the body to an active coenzyme form.

has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning.
(adoB) and methylcobalamin (MeB) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B that naturally occur in the body.
of the body's reserves are stored as adoB in the liver.
plants nor animals are independently capable of constructing vitamin B.
bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its biosynthesis.
production of B is achieved through fermentation of selected microorganisms.
griseus", a bacterium once thought to be a yeast, was the commercial source of vitamin B for many years.
B functions as a coenzyme, meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
humans, two major coenzyme B-dependent enzyme families corresponding to the first two reaction types, are known.
of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer.
this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur.
B-dependent MTR reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism.
addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain neurotransmitters, catecholamines and in brain metabolism.
neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B deficiency.
first is an intestinal mechanism using intrinsic factor through which 1-2 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours.
second is a diffusion process by which approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed.
human physiology of vitamin B is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B deficiency.
acid releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore antacid and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B.
addition some elderly people produce less stomach acid as they age thereby increasing their probability of B deficiencies.
(also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin) is a B binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands.
must wait to bind food-B until B has been freed from proteins in food by pepsin in the stomach.
then binds to the R-protein to avoid degradation of it in the acidic environment of the stomach.
the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins and release their bound B, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B).
of food vitamin B thus requires an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, intrinsic factor, and small bowel.
with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B deficiency possible.
who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B.
pernicious anemia, there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis, in which antibodies form against parietal cells.
may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B protective function.
the IF/B complex is recognized by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the portal circulation.
vitamin is then transferred to transcobalamin II (TC-II/B), which serves as the plasma transporter.
the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed.
total amount of vitamin B stored in body is about 2–5 mg in adults.
0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed.
is the main form of B excretion; most of the B secreted in the bile is recycled via enterohepatic circulation.
B beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine.
the process, he discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss.
tried this and reported some signs of success in 1920.
specific factor treatment for pernicious anemia, found in liver juice, had been found by this coincidence.
events led to discovery of the soluble vitamin, called vitamin B, from bacterial broths.
chemical structure of the molecule was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin and her team in 1956, based on crystallographic data.
Tolstoj quadrangle in the equatorial region of Mercury runs from 144 to 216° longitude and-25 to 25° latitude.
was provisionally called "Tir", but renamed after Leo Tolstoy by the International Astronomical Union in 1976.
contains the southern part of Caloris Planitia, which is the largest and best preserved basin seen by Mariner 10.
Southern Ocean contains the largest population of krill in the world.
ancient and degraded Tolstoj multiring basin, about 350 km in diameter, is in the south-central part of the quadrangle.
daily range of 600 K is greater than that on any other body in the solar system.
10 photographic coverage was available for only the eastern two-thirds of the Tolstoj quadrangle.
data from three Mariner 10 encounters with Mercury were used in mapping the quadrangle.
showed the plains to contain highly eroded remnants of large craters and basins that are only very shallow circular depressions.
complex history of contemporaneous craters and plains formation is therefore suggested.
detailed discussion of the origin of the intercrater plains on the Moon and Mercury was given by Strom.
because their distribution cannot now be mapped accurately, many of these patches are included with the smooth plains material.
patches of these intermediate plains, where clearly rougher and possibly older, are mapped as the intermediate plains material.
impact that produced the Tolstoj Basin occurred very early in the history of the quadrangle.
patches of material of dark albedo lie outside the innermost ring.
central part of the basin is covered by smooth plains material.
ejecta tends to be blocky and only weakly lineated between the inner and outer rings.
lineations with a slight swirly pattern are best seen on the southwest side of Tolstoj.
the Imbrium and Orientale Basins on the Moon, it is surrounded by an extensive and well-preserved ejecta blanket.
the ejecta also influences a large part of the as-yet-unseen terrain to the west.
stratigraphic and structural comparison between the Orientale and Caloris Basins has been made by McCauley.
and others have proposed a formal rock stratigraphy for the Caloris Basin that we have adopted on the present map.
the Imbrium-related stratigraphy of Shoemaker and Hackman, that devised for Mercury is a rock rather than a time stratigraphy.
Caloris floor plains material is a special problem and is not included in the Caloris Group.
Caloris floor plains have a more open, coarser fracture pattern than does the Maunder.
ridges in the floor of Caloris lack the crenulated crests that are common on lunar ridges.
plains also embay the Caloris Formation and account in particular for the skeletal map pattern of the Van Eyck Formation.
obvious secondary craters from Caloris have been recognized on the smooth plains.
patches of very smooth plains material occur in the floors of many of the youngest craters.
of these dark- halo craters has associated bright rays, although secondary craters are well preserved.
implications of contrasting color differences for mercurian crater and plains materials have been discussed by Hapke and others.
circumbasin scarps around Caloris, Tolstoj, and Mozart are the most prominent structural features in the quadrangle.
roughly rectilinear outlines of massifs within the Caloris Montes suggest structural control by a prebasin fracture pattern.
much lower, discontinuous outer scarp is considered to be the feeble equivalent of the Montes Cordillera scarp around Orientale.
the Cordillera, it probably lies outside the limit of the crater of excavation.
Van Eyck Formation is characterized by an extensive radial ridge-and-valley system with minor concentric scarps and lineaments.
a small part of the ridge and fracture system that characterizes the floor of Caloris is within the quadrangle.
Tolstoj Basin is encompassed by parts of at least three ragged and discontinuous inward-facing scarps.
sharpness of the single rim-scarp of Mozart reflects the youth (younger than the smooth plains) of this large impact.
like the lunar mare ridges, appear to mark the outlines of subjacent craters.
lineaments may have been enhanced or preserved by the gentle upwarping of this region of Tolstoj ejecta discussed above.
largest lineament, which marks the northwest limit of recognizable Tolstoj ejecta, is a subdued scarp some 450 km long.
of earlier faults or fractures by subsequent impacts probably occurred throughout the history of the planet.
azimuthal trends of all lineaments mapped within the quadrangle are, however, dominantly northwest (315°) and northeast (35°–40°).
situation is reminiscent of the so-called lunar grid on the Moon, which is generally ascribed to planetwide internal causes.
this event was a period of only slightly less intense bombardment.
period was followed by impact of the asteroid that created the Caloris Basin and deposits of the Caloris Group.
of the smooth plains and Caloris floor plains materials may have been deposited during or immediately after the Caloris event.
recognizable geologic history of the quadrangle ends with these events probably several billion years ago.
summary of the generalized geology history of Mercury was given by Guest and O’Donnell and Davies and others.

Malicious Practices Act ("Verordnung zur Abwehr heimtückischer Diskreditierung der nationalen Regierung") was passed on 21 March 1933 in Nazi Germany.
here on life for thousands of Germans would be controlled and monitored for those dubbed as‘social outcasts’.
Act in particular portrayed some of the Nazis'key political and philosophical policies.
Malicious Practices Act was a measure introduced to rid the German state of its‘oppressors'and‘enemies’.
two key guidelines were that of Protective Custody and Preventative Custody.
Custody was aimed at the undesirables within society, for example paupers, homosexuals and Jews.
who were unfortunate enough to fall into this category could be arrested even if an offence had not been committed.
particular this was in an attempt to eliminate other political parties from German politics and eradicate their presence permanently.
circular of the Reich and Prussian Minister of Interior, produced on 14 December 1937, stated:
who through minor, but repeated, infractions of the law demonstrate that they will not adapt socialist state, e.g.
tramps, whores, alcoholics with contagious diseases, particularly transmitted diseases, who evade the measures taken by the public health authorities."
being appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933, Hitler still faced huge problems.

quickly began sacking senior police officers in order to replace them with key Nazi supporters.
uniformed presence alone gained the support of ordinary Germans who sought change.
their existence brought fear and intimidation amongst the others, something which came to a head on 27 February 1933.
was pursued through the mass arrests of political party leaders and the closure of party newspapers.
Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties.
arrests were introduced in order to round up members of the socialists and communist parties.
Communist Party and the Socialists have left the coalition that Prodi forged to gain his parliamentary majority.
parties, more or less reformed as socialists, appeal to a surprising number of voters.
10,000 Communists and Socialists were arrested in March and April.
June, the numbers in‘protective custody’-most of the workers- had doubled.
good number of those arrested were the victims of denunciations by neighbours of workmates.

time has shown that conditions within concentration camps were harsh, dangerous and eventually, murderous.
Nuremberg laws were also introduced to stamp out any Jewish presence.
in 1935 at the annual party rally, the laws had two basic aims.
the Reich Citizenship Law was also passed, which stripped Jews of their citizenship.
anti-Jewish prejudice and violence did not end here, with events radicalising during Kristallnacht on 10 November 1938.
the passing of the Enabling Law would have been fairly impossible without the Malicious Practices Act.
soit je... " (English:"So Be I...") is a 1988 song recorded by the French artist Mylène Farmer.
versions achieved a relative success on the charts, failing twice to reach the top ten in France.
single was released under the traditional formats (vinyls) but also CD maxi and, for the first time, a CD video.
single was also released in Japan, but about two years after the Francophone countries.
for all her songs since "Tristana", Farmer wrote the lyrics.
suggests that "the singer's single religion is despair, sadness and great lucidity on the future".
speaks to someone to warn him against her own solitude.
same semantic field is used as in "Regrets": cold, winter, time.
in "Rêver" and "Redonne-moi", some lyrics are sung in the high notes to express sadness.
5:23 video was directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also wrote the screenplay.
video was the singer's favourite at the time, and was her sole one in sepia tone.
said in an interview that the sobriety of the clip was well suited to this song.

she goes down again next to the deer and gets up with her face covered with mud.
the end of the video, the owl flies and the snow starts again to fall.
to journalist Caroline Bee, the "melancholy tone is accentuated by the cold colours".
"Top 50" gave a positive review of the video, saying it"is both simple and technically impeccable.
video for the 1997 single release was composed of images from the 1996 tour.
single debuted at number 31 and reached a peak at number twelve in its sixth week.
most of her performances, Farmer wore a large white wedding dress.
1997, she also performed the song to promote the live version, on "Les Enfants de la lune" (TF1, 6 June).
the Mylène Farmer en concert (1989), Farmer wore a black patterned dress and began crying from the second refrain.
the Live à Bercy (1996), Farmer wore a clear trousers and a bra, and was accompanied by pianist Yvan Cassar.

2007, historian Nigel West providesd perhaps the longest single description of the OMS in English in his book "Mask".
2011, historian Thomas Sakmyster stated: The OMS was the Comintern's department for the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities.
sources agree that the OMS "acted as an adjuct between the two main Soviet intelligence services."

1923, the OMS received direction from the "Illegal Commission," headed by Mikhail Trilisser and two others.
1924, direction of the OMS transferred to the GRU and the OGPU.

1937-1939, the OMS received blame as a center of counter-revolutionary activity, by which time it was "totally liquidated."
Krivitsky's assessment, this role made Piatnitsky effectively "Finance Minister and Director of Personnel" of the Comintern.

scores are interpreted with a norm-referenced or criterion-referenced interpretation, or occasionally both.
norm-referenced interpretation means that the score conveys meaning about the examinee with regards to their standing among other examinees.
are two types of test scores: raw scores and scaled scores.
scaled score is the results of some transformation applied to the raw score.
purpose of scaled scores is to report scores for all examinees on a consistent scale.
that a test has two forms, and one is more difficult than the other.
on both forms can be converted to a scale so that these two equivalent scores have the same reported scores.
example, they could both be a score of 350 on a scale of 100 to 500.
well-known tests in the United States that have scaled scores are the ACT and the SAT.
ACT's scale ranges from 0 to 36 and the SAT's from 200 to 800 (per section).
outside that range are difficult to measure, and return little practical value.
return of the settlers would be a difficult process both in practical terms and because of Israeli public opinion.
it is not an issue of psychometrics, per se, but an issue of interpretability.
tests are scored "right-wrong", an important assumption has been made about learning.
addition, a secondary assumption is made that there is no meaningful information in the "wrong" answers.
fact that the answer is correct does not indicate which of the several possible procedures were used.
the student supplies the answer (or shows the work) this information is readily available from the original documents.
if the "wrong" answers were "blind" guesses, there would be no information to be found among these answers.
this second case it should be possible to extract this order from the responses to the test items.
extraction processes, the Rasch model for instance, are standard practice for item development among professionals.
rescaling is intended to compare these scores to a standard of some sort.
further collapse of the test results systematically removes all the information about which particular items were missed.
scoring practice oversimplifies these data in the initial scoring step.
result of this procedural error is to obscure diagnostic information that could help teachers serve their students better.
procedure bypasses the limitations produced by the linear dependencies inherent in test data.

(August 10, 1915- February 16, 1969) was a Chicago businessman, inventor, and social theorist.
built several profitable businesses during the years of the Great Depression.
also designed and created a safety lever device for hydraulic machine presses to improve worker safety.
was first put to use in his primary manufacturing facility.
during the 1930s and thereafter, mechanical production engineers copied and put Gordon's development to use in factories throughout the Midwest.
an industrialist during the 1940s and 1950s, Gordon adopted various public service social policies that benefited the families of workers.
also was an astute evaluator of commercial value within the communication industry.
was born on a tenant farm in Gary, Indiana, in 1915.
lived there as a young boy until his family moved to Chicago.
his parents opened a grocery store on Archer Avenue, located south of Cicero.
Chicago, besides the grocery store, Gordon's father, Victor, went into partnership with a W.O.
to develop and grow a food-processing and distribution business, the W.O.
graduated from law school at 19, too young to be permitted to take the bar examination to become a lawyer.
he and a high school friend, M.J. Levine, went to work as salespersons for a sugar supply company.
21, the minimum legal age, Gordon successfully took the bar exam and became a member of the Illinois Bar.)
and his friend later acquired the profitable sugar company where they had begun their commercial careers.
the 1930s Gordon went into business for himself, starting up the United Packing& Gasket Company.
factory, located in Cicero, originally was a government confiscated Al Capone distillery during the Volstead Act years.
company manufactured gaskets and other components for the automotive industry.
the post sputnik period, Gordon manufactured specially designed absorbent parts used for the U.S. Government rocket program.
food processing company as well as his future interest in the sugar supply company which his partner maintained.
some of the workers would gamble and occasionally lose their entire paychecks.
policy ensured that the families of workers who gambled would still have money for bills and expenses.
a result of his progressive worker friendly policies, Gordon's workers never unionized or struck his plants during his lifetime.
Gordon started up his gasket operations, hydraulic machine presses were extremely dangerous.
safety feature prevented workers from inadvertently placing an idle hand or arm inside the presses when they were in operation.
adaptation of his machine presses eventually became known in the industrial Midwest.
manufacturers sent a team of engineers to Gordon's plant to inspect his retrofitted machine presses on a first-hand basis.
World War II, the U.S. government rationed many vital commodities.
solve this raw materials shortage Gordon developed a process to create synthetic cork from crushed peanut shells.
his machine press improvement, Gordon allowed his patentable rights for this process to vest in the public domain.
purchased stock in small to mid-size telephone companies and exchanges throughout the Midwest during the 1930s,'40s, and'50s.
these companies were consolidated into AT&T's or Continental Telephone's massive operations.
when he was a young man and throughout his life, Gordon was fascinated with the telephone.
saw it as more than a mere communication device, believing that the telephone had the capability to truly level society.
the phone lines, according to Gordon, such issues that stratify society as race, social status, and ethnicity become moot.
envisioned the quickly expanding telephone network as the ideal social network.
prescient 1950s-'60s theorizing regarding the telephone anticipated such popular modern-day Internet social networks as Facebook and MySpace.
the phone, you are able to become the very best person that you can possibly be," Gordon said.
his death, Gordon followed up with participating students to assess their progress in implementing these ideas with annual telephone calls.
early prognostications regarding assumed personalities in virtual environments have relevance in today's highly wired world.
the 1950s, Gordon anticipated the modern era of cell phones.
course, Gordon's prescient views regarding telephony are now a commercial reality.
he died, Gordon was writing a book, to be entitled "Success at Arm's Reach".
a heart attack at 46, Gordon recuperated at his residence in Highland Park, Illinois.
Park, with its tree lined streets nestled on Lake Michigan, was an excellent venue for him to contemplate his future.
Park hosts the tranquil Ravinia Park music festival which is the oldest in North America.
first telephone call Gordon received during his Highland Park convalescence was from someone attempting to sell cemetery plots.
energized him to quickly take up the cause of privacy rights.
began to think about the issue of privacy in the broader context of civil rights.
also became an active public speaker on the topic of privacy rights.
presentation he made on this topic was before a meeting of the International Academy of Law and Science.
worked to disseminate his views on privacy rights in other ways.
addition to privacy rights, Gordon also advocated civil and political rights.
preconditions for the enjoyment of civil and political rights cannot be built overnight.
and political rights were extended to the working class.
the 1960s, he tried to help an oppressed family flee Communist Czechoslovakia.
the time Czechoslovakia was a brutal police state that did not permit normal immigration.
assistance involved communicating in code with the Czech family through the pre-arranged placement of different-imaged postage stamps on airmail letters.
despite Gordon's concerted efforts, the Czech family was unable to escape from the Iron Curtain country.
was a Fellow in the American Judicature Society and in the International Academy of Law and Science.
and Goldye Gordon had five children: Sandy, Judy, Barbara, Robert, and Alan.
to the role of MMPs in pathological conditions, inhibitors of MMPs may have therapeutic potential.
might have other biological activities which have yet been fully characterised.
potent MMP inhibitors have been identified, including hydroxymates, thiols, carbamoylphosphonates, hydroxyureas, hydrazines, β-lactams, squaric acids and nitrogenous ligands.
first generation of MMP inhibitors were based on the structure of the collagen molecule.
first MMP inhibitors that were tested in patients were Ilomastat and Batimastat.
MMP inhibitors have exhibited serious side effects during preclinical trials.
MMP inhibitors are unable to target specific MMPs connected to specific pathological conditions.
they inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which have protective functions or are not related to pathology.
studies investigating the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were encouraging.
these results, clinical studies were conducted but turned out to be disappointing.
studies have shown that MMPs may even have paradoxical roles in tumor progression.
seem to have tumor-promoting effects as well as tumor suppressive effects dependent on different contexts.
inhibitor binds to the zinc at the active center of the enzyme, thereby blocking its activity.
and MMP form a complex which is able to inactivate the MMP.
mechanism to inhibit MMP activity is by dislodging the enzymes from their receptors.
salts bind to a heavy metal site distinct form the zinc-containing active center, which inhibits their activity.
activity can be decreased by binding to the cleavage site on the substrate e.g.
molecular features of most MMP inhibitors are responsible for the affinity.
structural difference MMPs'is mainly in the S1'side and by modifying the P1'group, inhibitor selectivity can be developed.
potential MMP inhibitors will be explained in the following sections, including information on their development, structure-activity relationship and pharmacokinetics.
was mentioned before, the first generation of MMP inhibitors were based on the structure of the collagen molecule.
relationship between the collagen molecule and one of the first generation inhibitors, Marimastat, is shown in figure 2.
and Batimastat were the first two MMP inhibitors to be tested in patients.
structural relationship between these two inhibitors, and also to marimastat, can be seen in figure 3.
hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors display an excellent anticancer activity in tumor cells but the clinical performances of these compounds were disappointing.
they were tested in patients they induced dose-limiting muscular and skeletal pain in a number of the patients.
4 shows the structures of the hydroxamate-based inhibitors that followed the pioneering hydroxamate-based inhibitor structures.
main features of this group of molecules are a substituted aryl, a sulfonamide and a hydroxamate zinc-binding group.
has an N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminocarboxylate zinc-binding group, different from the hydroxamate-zinc binding group seen in MMI-270 and Cipemastat.
also has a triaryl substitution that the other structures didn‘t have.
three permutations direct the SAR away from MMP-1 and toward the „deep pocket“ MMPs such as the gelatinases.
shows anticancer activity in animal models, but it is easily metabolised to an amine metabolite that causes phospholipidosis.
has shown anticancer activity in numerous animal models, but there is no data available of its clinical performance.
on the other hand, is one of the best studied MMP inhibitors.
outcome of its clinical evaluation has not yet been disclosed.
has improved ADME and MMP-1 selectivity properties and has shown excellent oral efficacy in an animal model of osteoarthritis.
the therapeutic objectives for these inhibitors is not cancer, like it has been for most of the MMP inhibitors.
is a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor with a thiol zinc-binding group.
has some selectivity as it doesn't inhibit all the MMPs operations.
metalloproteinases that release TNF-alpha, TNF-II, L-selectin, IL-1-RII and IL-6 are for example not inhibited by Rebimastat.
phase I of clinical trials, there was no sign of dose-dependent joint toxicity and a disease stabilization.
was noted in phase II early breast cancer trials, which was connected to MMP inhibitor toxicity.
results of the trial was a higher incidence of adverse reactions, without survival benefit.
28-2653 is highly selective for MMP-2, MMP-9 and membrane type 1 (MT-1)-MMP.
has been shown to diminish tumor growth in nasal cancer in rats as well as prostate cancer cell cultures.
compound only has moderate effect on mices adipose tissue and no alteration on joints.
on this, it is concluded that class of inhibitors is less likely to trigger neuromuscular adverse effects.
556052-30-3 is similar to Ro 282653 but incorporates a 4-((2-methylquinolin-4-yl)methoxy)phenyl sidechain that is TACE selective.
is a compound named 848773-43-3 that is a potent MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 inhibitor that spares MMP-1 and TACE.
substituting 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl heteroaryl at C-4'of the diphenylether segment to accomplish MMP-13 selectivity over MT-1 MMP, made the compound 420121-84-2.
compound has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 1,0nM for MMP-13.
class of MMP inhibitors is easy to synthesize and are potent enough for clinical valuation.
is the latest pyrimidine based inhibitor, the compound is a pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxamide that is very potent and MMP-13 selective.
the S1'pocket of MMP-13 is an S1'side pocket that is unique to the matrix metalloproteiase.
dicarboxamides bind to this side pocket, which increases the selectivity.
and selective MMP-3 inhibitors have been developed by using a hydroxypyrone as the zinc
attaching an aryl backbone to the 2-position of the pyrone ring, more selectivity was gained.
the hydroxypyrone ring, three positions are available to attach backbones, position 2-, 5- and 6-.
on MMP inhibitors with phosphorus based zinc binding groups focused on α-biphenylsulfonylamino phosphonates.
inhibitors have been developed that exhibit selectivity for MMP-8 over other MMPs.
MMP-8 inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of acute liver disease and multiple sclerosis
MMP inhibitors have been reported to target MMP-11 and MMP-13.
phosphinate MMP inhibitors contain phenyl segments that are thought to be responsible for the selectivity to MMP-13.
phosphinic group of those inhibitors (RR (O)OH) binds as a zinc ligand.
inhibitors have been developed that showed high selectivity for MMP-11.
could be a useful target for tumorgenesis in breast cancer.
inhibitors with carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups do not bind through two oxygen of the phosphonate.
binding forms a 5-members chelate ring that looks similar to the binding of hydroxamic acid.
cell penetration prevention contributes to the low toxicity of these inhibitors.
with a carbamoyl phosphonate zinc-binding group are selective for MMP-2.
could be a useful target for tumor invasion and angiogenesis.
carbamoyl phosphonate inhibitor has been developed that affects MMP-2 and MMP-9 sparing other MMPs.
compound showed inhibitory activity on cell invasion and tumor colonization.
in vivo studies, this inhibitor showed efficacy with oral dosing and administration into the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal).
with carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups are water-soluble at physiological pH.
is believed that tetracyclines also effect MMP expression and proteolytic activity.
is a semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been studied for dental and medical applications.
effects on diseases like periodontitis and cancer has been investigated.
is nearly completely absorbed with a bioavailability about 95% in average and a 20% reduction with co-administration of food.
expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are often elevated in human cancer.
increased expression and activity correlates with advanced tumor stage, increased metastasis and prognosis.
modified tetracyclines (CMT) have been developed to explore their inhibitory potential.
studies in tetracyclines and CMTs showed that they can inhibit MMP activity.
CMT called COL-3 or metastat has been demonstrated to be a potent MMP inhibitor.
features a tetracycline scaffold that is unsubstituted on positions C4-C9.
are excreted through the urinary tract while 55-66% is excreted in feces.
drug is highly lipophilic and able to cross the blood brain barrier at higher doses.
clinical trials plasma protein binding has been shown to be high (~94,5%).
activity is regulated at various levels for example by endogenous inhibitors like α2-macroglobulin and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).
regulates a broad spectrum of proteases, while TIMPs are more specific endogenous MMP inhibitors.
is an abundant plasma protein that acts in tissue fluids.
does not inhibit the activation of MMPs or the MMPs themselves.
entraps proteinases like MMPs and forms a complex with them.
complex is endocytosed and cleared by a low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein.
of TIMP levels are considered to play a role in pathological conditions associated with unbalanced MMP activities.
N-terminal regions of the four TIMPs share a common structure.
and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values.
is a region composed of a common country that we share with the Palestinians.
all contain twelve cysteine residues that form six disulfide bonds.
bonds are critical for the conformation of the N-terminal and its MMP-inhibitory activities.
TIMP molecule form fits into the active site of an MMP.
TIMP contact the catalytic cleft of the MMP in a similarly as a substrate.
inhibit all MMPs except TIMP-1 which does not inhibit MT-1-MMP.
examples are TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 which are more potent MMP-2 inhibitors than MMP-9 inhibitors.
could potentially be useful against illnesses like cardiovascular disease and cancer.
application of TIMPs as therapeutic instrument through gene therapy or direct protein application is still in early stages of development.
is preferable to inhibit specific MPPs that play a role in pathological conditions.
TIMPs inhibit multiple MMPs it is desirable to develop engineered TIMPs with altered specificity.
targeting of specific MMPs is expected to improve efficacy and prevent side effects like musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS).
structures of MMP inhibitors provide a source of insight of the structural relationships for selectivity.
throughput screening can as well increase the chances of discovering inhibitors with high selectivity.
Siege of Akragas took place in 406 BC in Sicily; the Carthaginian enterprise ultimately lasted a total of eight months.
Carthaginian Senate, after some debate, agreed to intervene on behalf of Segesta.
no treaties had been signed between the Greeks and Carthaginians to signal a closure of hostilities.
first defeated the men of Motya, then ravaged their land.
next target was the territory of "Golden Shell", the land around Panormus.
activities gained Hermocrates fame and sympathy with Sicilian Greeks, but no recall from Syracuse.
general finally tried to stage a coup in Syracuse, where he died in a street fight.
and Akragas did not neglect their defenses during the activities of Hermocrates.
walls of both the cities were also kept in repair.
and Akragas took speedy action to prepare for the expected Punic response after the downfall of Hermocrates.
posted a fleet of forty triremes at Eryx to watch for the movement of the Punic navy.
when his kinsman Himilco was appointed as his deputy, Hannibal set about making preparations in earnest.
was a prudent move which was to pay dividends shortly.
outnumbered Greek ships now gave way and the Punic expedition safely landed near Motya.
Libyans supplied both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army.
heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses.
light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry.
Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear.
Heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields and short thrusting swords.
Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear, but often were equipped by Carthage.
Libyans, Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields.
provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle.
and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge.
at this time did not use elephants, but Libyans provided bulk of the heavy, four horse war chariots for Carthage.
Punic navy was built around the trireme, Carthaginian citizens usually served alongside recruits from Libya and other Carthaginian domains.
is no mention of an Akragan navy, but the relief force contained had 30 triremes.
Carthaginian army was unopposed by the Greeks when they marched towards Akragas in the early summer of 406 BC.
left his warships at Motya before setting out for Akragas.
began preparation for the siege in earnest once his army reached Akragas.
Akragans did not oppose these activities, but stayed within their city.
the final preparations were made, Greeks awaited the Carthaginian assault.
decided not to build circumventing walls but to starve the Greeks into submission.
position of the city on high ground made it difficult to assault directly or storm from several directions at once.
chose to use two siege towers to assault one of the gates on the west side of the city.
Carthaginians managed to inflict casualties on the defenders but after an all-day struggle, could not force the gate.
night the Greeks made a sortie and burnt the towers down.
Punic soldiers were uneasy about desecrating tombs, and they panicked when a plague broke out in the Carthaginian camps.
this point Daphnaeus of Syracuse arrived with 30,000 hoplites and 5,000 cavalry to break the siege, accompanied by thirty triremes.
Greek army may have been larger as light troops are not included in the tally.
Greeks ultimately managed to defeat the Carthaginians in a hotly contested battle.
Punic army fled the field leaving almost 6,000 dead behind.
positioned the Greeks favorable against the Punic army, with the initiative firmly in their hands.
in overall command of the Greek army, scouted the main Carthaginian camp, and decided against a direct assault.
Greek army at Akragas was kept supplied by huge ship convoys carrying provisions from Syracuse.
Carthaginians soon faced food shortages, and the mercenaries began to grow restless as starvation set in the Punic camp.
winter approached, the situation grew from serious to desperate for the Carthaginians.
– Europe’s situation is serious – very serious.
was saved from dealing with a mutiny by good fortune and prompt action.
when the mercenaries had reached their breaking point, Carthaginians learned of the approach of a supply convoy from Syracuse.
the surviving Greek triremes beached themselves, the Carthaginian flotilla captured the entire convoy.
solved the supply problems for Himilco, and caused the Greeks in turn to face the threat of starvation.
secretly bribed the Campanian mercenaries, who deserted Akragas after complaining of food shortages.
rapidly dwindling food stocks persuaded the Akragan authorities to abandon the city.
mid-December, 40,000 people along with the army, marched east for Gela, carrying whatever valuables they could out of the city.
sick, the old and some diehards stayed behind in Akragas.
had little difficulty taking and pillaging the nearly empty city the following morning, putting to sword any who resisted.
winter had set in, Himilco did not push onto Gela but encamped at Akragas.
city, the richest in Sicily, was thoroughly plundered, and many priceless pieces of art were shipped to Carthage.
Carthaginian army would stay in the city until the spring of 405, when the campaign for Gela took place.
refugees of Akragas accused Daphnaeus and the other generals of treason in Syracuse.

to the International Cooperative Alliance, a cooperative is a “jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.”
the summit, the leaders discussed nuclear terrorism threats and nuclear security preparedness.
Washington summit had focused on nuclear terrorism with explosive nuclear devices, perceiving that as the biggest threat to international security.
2012 Seoul summit also discussed protection against dirty bombs and the sabotage of nuclear facilities.

article explains the differences in meaning between some technical terms used in economics and the corresponding terms in everyday usage.
all economists and policymakers defer to the NBER's determination for the precise dates of a U.S. recession's beginning and end.
example, a dictionary definition is: "not engaged in a gainful occupation", which is broader than the economic definition.
use the word "money" to mean very liquid assets which are held at any moment in time.
units of measurement are dollars or another currency, with no time dimension, so this is a stock variable.
assets, such as land and buildings, may also be included.
related but different everyday usage occurs in the sentence "He makes a lot of money."
with the term "investment", the everyday usage of "capital" coincides with its use by financial economists.
everyday usage, "government spending" refers to the broader concept of government spending on goods and services plus transfer payments.
spending by governments, unlike current spending, can be self-financing through user charges.
general usage, including by economists outside the above context, welfare refers to a form of transfer payment.
use the word efficient to mean any of several closely related things:
of these definitions involve the idea that nothing more can be achieved given the resources available.
popular usage, efficient often has the similar but less precise meaning "functioning effectively".
lost potential gain is the cost of the opportunity that is accepted.
this cost is explicit: for example, if a firm pays $100 for a machine, its cost is $100.
accounting, there is a different technical concept of cost, which excludes implicit opportunity costs.
"marginal" in common usage tends to mean "tangential", implying limited importance, in economics "marginal" means "incremental".
common usage, "significant" usually means "noteworthy" or "of substantial importance".
econometrics— the use of statistical techniques in economics— "significant" means "unlikely to have occurred by chance".
example, suppose one wishes to find if the minimum wage rate affects firms'decisions on how much labor to hire.
not, then it is said that the estimate is "insignificant at the 5% level".
this case the technique, as well as the estimate obtained with the technique, is called "biased".
economics it refers to a quantitative measurement of the degree of flexibility of something in response to something else.
general usage, one is said to be rational if one is sane or lucid.

the living conditions of Azeris in Iran closely resemble that of Persians:
in Iran are in high positions of authority with the Azeris Ayatollah Ali Khamenei currently sitting as the Supreme Leader.

in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an important part of the nation's economy.
the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.
because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low.
Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse.
road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities.
the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill equipped to handle this growing problem.
the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems.
the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads.
the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.
underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport.
nation's merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world.
civil air transport was the largest by total destinations and vehicles during most of its post-war existence.
the USSR, Aeroflot had a monopoly on all air transport.
ranged from civil transport and cargo to transporting political prisoners to the gulags, and more.
practically uninhabitable weather also made travel and construction nearly impossible.
travel would be the best means of transportation for people and cargo.
at its formation in March 1932, had three main purposes.
engineers would play a key role in the origins of Soviet aircraft manufacturer, Ilyushin.
much of the Soviet Union's existence, air travel served to deliver freight.
the 1930s, freight made up 85 percent of Aeroflot's services.
fact, in 1939, they surpassed the U.S. in volume of airfreight.
Stalin's strong xenophobia, Aeroflot commenced its first international route in 1936, operating between Moscow and Prague.
jet age and the introduction of new, faster and more reliable ways of air travel greatly changed Soviet aviation.
the Soviet Union essentially revolved around Moscow, this networking technique proved effective.
the early 1980s, Aeroflot had experienced massive growth in the aviation market.
carried 116.1 million passengers and millions of pounds of cargo.
because of travel restrictions, only 3.4 million passengers were international travelers.
the mid-late 1980s, Aeroflot's domestic flights were noted consistently as "harrowing" experiences for both Western and Soviet passengers.
board, passengers complained of being forced to sit in "hot airplane cabins without air conditioning", and "indifferent" cabin crews.
the time Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroika and its reforms, permitting free speech and pluralism, Aeroflot had shown considerable growth.
needs time to put its pro-growth reforms in place.
the Soviet Union broke up, Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new, free market economy.
became a privatized company, and soon other airlines found their way into the Russian spotlight.
1993, Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes.

Soviet Union had 7,192 airports, of which 1,163 had paved surface.
Soviet authorities, under Leonid Brezhnev, began focusing on the national pipeline system in the 1970s.
as with many other sectors of the Soviet economy, bad maintenance led to deterioration.
the late 1980s only 1,500 km pipelines were under maintenance, half of what was minimally needed.
the storage facilities were inadequate to handle the growing Soviet oil supply.
in the pipelines network became, in the 1980s, a common feature of the system.
crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr.
had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used.
were even some who believed in the recapitalisation of the railways.
leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate.
resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate.
Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich to solve the railway crisis in 1935.
problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities.
much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber.
and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.
the 1980s Soviet railways had become the most intensively used in the world.
explanation has to do with Soviet policy, the first being the autarkic model created by Joseph Stalin's regime.
country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.
transport played a minor role in the Soviet economy, compared to domestic rail transport or First World road transport.
road network had problems meeting the people's demand, a problem which the Soviet leadership publicly acknowledged.
the 1980s, there were 13 million laborers employed in the transport sector.
developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies.
transport and the volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly.
transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances (defined as less than 200 km) than rail transport.
more expensive than railway transport, due to long distances between starting points and destinations.
of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in the 1980s, while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent.
obstacle was that Five-Year Plans in the USSR's later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions.
roads were not paved, and because of this shortage, several dirt roads were created.
of cars, however, had increased dramatically in the late 1970s.
a very small proportion of the population in the USSR owned cars.
of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport.
the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses.
1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel.
bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.
industry was under the control of the Ministry of Merchant Marine of the USSR.
1913 85 percent of all merchant ships were foreign built.
Stalin died in 1953, his successor started to increase trade with non-communist countries, most of which were on other continents.
1974 it had reached 14.1 million deadweight tons, about 3 percent of the world's total.
the 114 million tons moved by the Soviet merchant marine in 1974, 90 million of it was export and import.
reason for the technological backwardness of the merchant marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping.
Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world.
of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.
Soviet Union had 26 major ports, eleven of them inland ports.
of the ports could be considered major by world standards.
the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically.
in the northeast territories of the USSR most ports were closed down due to cold climate.

did not believe that residents of Quebec were uniformly antisemitic.
book about Groulx and other Quebec nationalists was based on her doctoral dissertation.
average period for approval of a thesis at the university was three to six months.
articles acknowledged Groulx's antisemitism and the generally favourable attitude of the Roman Catholic church towards fascist doctrine during the 1930s.
claimed that Delisle's work had been subsidized by Jewish organizations, but did not document this.
asked Canal D to rebroadcast the documentary as they considered Charron's introduction to be defamatory and inaccurate.
is revered among French residents of Quebec as a father of Quebec nationalism, although his work is little read today.
separate his political and literary activities from his academic work, Groulx wrote journalism and novels under numerous pseudonyms.
would be no more Jews here other than those who could survive by living off one another.
Delisle's message is discomfiting to many French-Canadian nationalists and it should be.
portrays a nationalism which was racist, paranoid, xenophobic, and anti-Semitic.
Scott has noted that, after Delisle's work was quoted with approval in Mordecai Richler's book"Oh Canada!
Quebec!," which generated its own controversy, Delisle was subject to considerable criticism.
1994, Gary Caldwell criticized Delisle's work on the following grounds in an article in "The Literary Review of Canada".
is a sociologist and demographer who is a member of the governing national council of the Parti Québécois.
weight of individual national members of the Governing Council is much greater.
summary, Caldwell characterized the Université Laval as "disloyal" to the French Canadian community for having granted Delisle a doctorate.
Delisle contested his conclusions in a letter published in "Le Devoir" on April 11, 2003.
and Caldwell both acknowledge that Groulx at times expressed antisemitic opinions.
by contrast, argues that antisemitism is an integral component of Groulx'race-based nationalism and his enthusiasm for right-wing authoritarian governments.

yet chronic disease has become a major social problem that requires a collective response.
meant that, prior to minimally invasive surgery, many women underwent multiple laparotomies for only mild pathologies.
these cases, the surgical intervention of a laparotomy was considered to be more damaging than the disease itself.

legal implications of marketing claims call for caution or overstated claims can lead to regulatory or civil challenges.
term Green Marketing came into prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
proceedings of this workshop resulted in one of the first books on green marketing entitled "Ecological Marketing".
were by Ken Peattie (1992) in the United Kingdom and by Jacquelyn Ottman (1993) in the United States of America.
past decade has shown that harnessing consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far easier said than done.
these challenges, green marketing has continued to gain adherents, particularly in light of growing global concern about climate change.
are also growing fears that climate change will more adversely threaten the lives of the poor.
emerging greenhouse gas reduction market can potentially catalyze projects with important local environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits.
stronger growth will benefit emerging markets that export goods and services to the US.
popularity of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated.
is an unfortunate legacy from the 1970s when shower heads sputtered and natural detergents left clothes dingy.
sometimes take advantage of this confusion, and purposely make false or exaggerated "green" claims.
term“greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits.
reality, the company may be doing very little that is environmentally beneficial
January 2012, Patagonia became the first brand to register for benefit corporation status.
68% can be classified as Light Greens, consumers who buy green sometimes.
1989, 67 percent of Americans stated that they were willing to pay 5-10 percent more for ecologically compatible products.
1991, environmentally conscious individuals were willing to pay between 15-20 percent more for green products.
more than one-third of Americans say they would pay a little extra for green products
important challenge facing marketers is to identify which consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products.
is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful.
social marketing "P's" that are used in this process are:
level of greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what activities should be undertaken by a company.
greening in one area may or may not be leveraged effectively in others.
although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless strategic in the product area.
individual's belief that an environmental claim lacks honesty can have a negative effect on attitude toward a brand.
on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment.
life cycle assessment model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout the life cycle of a product.
main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products.
addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.
today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use.
resulting carbon emissions are substantially higher than those of the transportation sector.
interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building.
product had difficulty climbing out of its deep green niche.
consumer electronics sector provides room for using green marketing to attract new customers.
example of this is HP's promise to cut its global energy use 20 percent by the year 2010.
products for example, are one of the most popular alternatives that can benefit the environment.
benefits include sustainable forestry, clean air, energy efficiency, water conservation, and a healthy office.

cascading effect that resulted ultimately forced the shutdown of more than 100 power plants.
trip caused load to transfer to other transmission lines, which were not able to bear the load, tripping their relays.
software bug known as a race condition existed in General Electric Energy's Unix-based XA/21 energy management system.

conventional VRLA battery tends to deteriorate quickly when operated in this partial SoC range.
United States Department of Energy has also funded UltraBattery for research into grid-scale stationary energy storage applications.
2007, CSIRO formed a subsidiary company, Ecoult, to address this market.
also received support from the Australian Government to further the development of Ultrabattery.
May 2010, US battery manufacturer East Penn Manufacturing acquired Ecoult from CSIRO.
is a hybrid device that combines ultracapacitor technology with lead-acid battery technology in a single cell with a common electrolyte.
technology (specifically the addition of the carbon electrode) gives UltraBattery different performance characteristics to conventional VRLA batteries.
normal lead-acid battery operation, lead sulfate crystals grow on the negative electrode during discharging and dissolve again during charging.
time sulfation can become permanent, as some crystals grow and resist being dissolved.
condition is sometimes termed the“hard” sulfation of the battery electrode [REF].
undesirable effect is the production of hydrogen inside the plate, further reducing the efficiency of the reaction.
The inefficiency is largely due to increases the incidence of side reactions (for instance electrolysis) which dissipate energy.
presence of the ultracapacitor integrated in the UltraBattery acts to limit the formation of hard sulfation inside the cell.
This supports the battery’s ability to operate for long periods in a partial SoC where the battery operates more efficiently.
continues into the reasons why the presence of the ultracapacitor reduces sulfation so successfully.
electrolyte solution is made up of sulfuric acid and water.
can be used for a range of energy storage applications, such as:
is virtually 100 per cent recyclable and can be made at existing battery manufacturing facilities.
has several advantages over the existing nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries currently used in hybrid electric vehicles.
for later use) renewable energy sources on microgrids to improve predictable power availability.
can also be used in standalone microgrid systems, renewables power systems and hybrid microgrids.
microgrid systems combine diesel or other fossil fuels with UltraBattery storage to improve the efficiency of fossil-fuel energy generation.
energy storage in the system reduces the size of the gen-set (i.e.
of generators) because the batteries can handle peaks in the load.
power systems combine UltraBattery technology with the renewable generation source to deliver local power.
can use either photovoltaic, wind or solar thermal energy, and commonly incorporate a back-up diesel generator.
microgrids integrate renewable generation sources with UltraBattery energy storage and fossil-fuel gen-sets to maximize the efficiency of base-load generation.
main challenge with renewables is energy storage, in two senses.
can greatly reduce the cost of energy compared with diesel-only powered microgrids.
example of this type of microgrid is the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project (KIREIP), being undertaken by Hydro Tasmania.
megawatt-scale renewable energy project aims to reduce both the cost of delivering power to the island and carbon pollution.
can be used to backup an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
conventional UPS systems, the batteries sit, essentially unused, until a grid outage event occurs.
load-levelling application uses 336 UltraBattery cells (1000 Ah, 2 volts).
Japan, the Shimizu Corporation has set up a microgrid (see Section 5.2) in a commercial building.
building'system, which includes 163 UltraBattery cells (500 Ah, 2 volts), also monitors cell voltage, impedance and temperature.
load-levelling application was set up to control the factory’s demand for power.
strings of UltraBattery cells are connected to the grid in Lyon Station, Pennsylvania.
project provides continuous frequency regulation services bidding into the open market on PJM.
turns the inherent variability of power from photovoltaic panels or wind turbines into a smooth, predictable signal.
the variability of the renewable signal in this way makes renewable energy more reliable.
allows electricity utilities to improve their overall system performance at peak times.

can reduce these effects and ensure power quality from the grid for local users.
battery’s capacity turnover is the amount of possible energy throughput in relation to the capacity of the battery.
is a normalized measure of how many times the theoretical capacity of a battery can be used over its lifetime.
higher capacity turnover indicates the battery provides more energy over its lifetime
charging and discharging, some of the battery’s stored energy is lost as heat, and some is lost in side reactions.
lower the energy losses of a battery, the more efficient the battery is.
high DC–DC efficiency of UltraBattery is achievable because (like conventional VRLA batteries) it operates very efficiently below 80% SoC.
indicate that for VRLA batteries“from zero SOC to 84% SOC the average overall battery charging efficiency is 91%”.
include thermal losses and losses due to various side reactions (chiefly hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and grid corrosion).
comparison with conventional VRLA batteries, UltraBattery can be charged efficiently and at high charging/discharging rates.
et al.’s test results showed that the Ultrabattery was able to cycle at the 4C1 rate for around 15,000 cycles.
VRLA battery using this test procedure could only cycle at the 1C1 rate.
battery would be fully discharged (or charged) in 15 minutes at the 4C rate.
exact chemical process by which carbon so significantly delays sulfation is not fully understood.
sulfation also significantly enhances charge acceptance by reducing hydrogen gas production at the electrode.
electrolyte solution contains H2SO4 in water, and its lead electrodes are inert.
have the same transport and hazard restrictions as conventional VRLA batteries
part of each UltraBattery– lead, plastic, steel and acid– is virtually 100% recyclable for later reuse.
recycling facilities for these batteries are already available and 96% of lead acid batteries used in the US are recycled.
manufacturers recover and separate the lead, plastics and acid from VRLA batteries.
parts are cleaned, ground, extruded and moulded into new plastic parts.
hybrid electric vehicles batteries were tested at a 70% SoC in a pulse charge-discharge pattern.
had about 1.8 times more capacity turnover, and therefore cycle life, than a conventional VRLA battery.
test car had comparable miles per gallon performance as the same model powered by Ni-MH batteries.
trial compared the performance of the UltraBattery and three other lead-acid battery types for renewable energy smoothing applications.
by Sandia National Laboratories show that UltraBattery performs for much longer than conventional VRLA batteries in utility cycling.
430 days of cycling, the East Penn UltraBattery and Furukawa UltraBattery still had not failed.
referendum on becoming an overseas department of France was held in Mayotte on 29 March 2009.
Comoran vice-president said the vote was a "declaration of war".
population of Mayotte was approximately 186,000 at the time of the election.
Mahorans are fluent only in local languages, including Shimaore and Bushi, rather than the French language.
is believed that one-third of the population consists of illegal immigrants, mostly from the neighboring, impoverished Comoros islands.
President Nicolas Sarkozy promised a referendum on Mayotte's future status during the 2007 French presidential election.
Mahorans hoped to benefit economically in the future with a possible yes result.
unemployment rate in Mayotte stood at over 25% at the time of the 2009 referendum.
of Mayotte's major political parties and politicians, including the General Council President Ahmed Attoumani Douchina, supported the "yes" campaign.
today’s political parties and politicians are so well known that Polish politics is boring us to sleep.
campaign also received strong support from the French government in Paris.
Islamic imams and religious leaders had urged a "no" vote.

already let go of two or three wives in the past."
poll results indicated that the "yes" option had received approximately 95.2% of the total votes cast.
estimated voter turnout was a high 61% of eligible Mahorans.
a yes result, Mayotte, which was an overseas collectivity, became an integral French department on March 31, 2011.
judicial, economic and social laws and customs will have to be changed to conform with French law.
will have to ban polygamy before it becomes a department.
currently do not have equal inheritance rights in Mayotte, which will be changed to comply with the French justice system.
minimum age in which a person can legally marry will be raised from 15 to 18 years old.
would likely have to legalise same-sex civil unions, known as PACS in France.
law will be progressively abolished and be replaced by uniform French civil code.
courts and justice system will be replaced by secular courts, though the qadis will retain a role as legal consultants.
a department, Mayotte will become eligible for expanded French social and economic programs, as well as European Union funds.
the French government will not immediately extend the social welfare system enjoyed by metropolitan France.
French government has also promised financial support to strengthen Mahoran infrastructure.
citizens will see increased income taxes as a result of their full integration in French republic.

parliament is the central legislative body in the political system of North Rhine-Westphalia.
State Parliament is the central legislative body of the state.
the state government itself can bring relevant bill proposals to parliament for consideration.
this stage, members of parliament again make suggestions regarding the bill.
are enacted by majority vote, as the constitution does not require any more stringent criteria for passage.
parliament operates by a quorum decision making process, meaning that only half of its legal members must be present.
amendments and the budget must go through the advisory process three times, instead of the standard two.
parliament rejects the referendum, then a plebiscite is undertaken in which the people at large can vote.
successful plebiscite leads to the referendum being passed as law.
practice, this form of direct democracy does not play a large role in the legislative process.
authority of the state parliament in numerous legal areas has waned in the last few decades.
is due to the overriding legal authority of the federal government in Berlin.
the United Kingdom, the government has had the legal authority to revoke naturalized Britons’ citizenship since 1918.
European Union likewise has a strong influence on the passage of laws at the national level.
through the Bundesrat, each state has a direct say in national matters, including those that involve the EU.
the Minister-President must always first be a member of parliament.
no such majority results, a runoff vote between two nominees takes place.
vote of no confidence dissolves the government and therefore automatically dismisses all state ministers.
Minister-President, in most cases, puts the government together with people from the coalition parties.
lead candidate for smaller coalition parties are regularly included in the government as ministers.
it will probably lead a coalition government, though with which other parties remains unclear.
to the state government, the state parliament has extensive powers.
as mentioned above, parliament has the power to dissolve the government through a motion of no confidence.
Court of Audit controls the use of state funds by all state governmental bodies.
court likewise controls the finances of the parliament, but it also reports to parliament, which elects the court’s highest members.
is meant to strengthen the independence of the judges on the court.
on population statistics, North Rhine-Westphalia is responsible for about a fifth of the members of the Federal Convention.
state parliament fills all those seats designated to the state that remain.
majority of work by the parliament takes place in committees, rather than in plenary sessions (which include all parliament members).
general, members of the state parliament are career politicians and sit together according to what party they belong to.
is also during this period that committee seats are filled.
"Präsidium" is headed by the President of the Parliament ("Landtagspräsident"), who is chosen from among the ranks of parliament.
general, the President of the Parliament comes from the largest constituent political party in the government.
Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia is elected by a system of personalized proportional representation.
members are selected by a universal, equal, direct, secret, and free vote.
the inclusion of overhang seats and leveling seats is possible.
members are elected by a direct mandate to represent specific constituencies.
remaining seats are allocated to candidates who appear on party lists.
first vote is cast directly for a candidate to represent a specific district.
second vote is for a party and largely determines the relative size of each party's bloc in the new parliament.
state has 17,554,329 residents (as of 31 December 2012), of which about 13.2 million citizens have the right to vote.
state is divided into 128 electoral districts of approximately equal population.
an electoral district differs more than 20% from the average size, new borders are drawn up.
for the election in each electoral district can come from parties, vote groups, and individual voters.
lists can only be put up for a vote by the parties themselves.
first vote that each voter casts is for a direct candidate to represent one of the 128 electoral districts.
winner of this vote enters the state parliament regardless of how the second vote (for the party list) turns out.
the distribution of seats for each party, the second vote is of particular significance.
an effort to balance representation, the second vote is not counted when:
seats are distributed to candidates among the winning parties in the order that they were listed in the party list.
theory, several parties can have overhang seats at the same time, though this has not yet occurred.
order of the parties depends first on the number of votes achieved by each party in the last state election.
members who were elected directly and do not belong to a party list, a special election is held.
parliament elected in 1947 only had a term of three years.
constitution from 1950 then established a four-year term for members of parliament, which was extended to five years in 1969.
all cases, new elections must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament.
course, do to overhang and leveling seats, parliament still has over 200 members.)
introduction of the second vote in May 2010 changed all that.
SPD won 99 seats, while the CDU managed to pick up 67.
CDU suffered heavy losses in the elections of 2010, but remained a strong force in parliament.
the bottom of the list is the Pirate Party, whose representatives are only 15% female.
in previous election periods, the state party leaders are entirely male.
the election of Hannelore Kraft marks the first time ever that a woman has headed the state government.

proportion of children of primary school age enrolled in school had long been virtually 100 percent.
was the norm, and females and males attended school in near-equal numbers at all levels.
is typical of any country, however, rates of schooling were higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
was a socially respected profession and one that paid relatively well.
teachers, trained in teachers'training colleges, were deemed well qualified.
main problem confronting the education system was the inadequacy of facilities, instructional materials, and teachers'aides.
schools often were seriously overcrowded and were forced to resort to holding classes in multiple shifts.
addition, dropout and repetition rates, although moderate by Latin American standards, were still considered high.
education in Uruguay was free and compulsory; it encompassed six years of instruction.
number of primary schools in 1987 was 2,382, including 240 private schools.
were 16,568 primary school teachers and 354,177 primary school students.
resulted in a pupil-teacher ratio of approximately twenty-one to one in 1987, compared with about thirty to one in 1970.
education in secondary schools encompassed six years of instruction divided into two three-year cycles.
first, or basic, cycle was compulsory; the second cycle was geared to university preparation.
addition to the academic track, public technical education schools provided secondary school education that was technical and vocational in nature.
two systems were parallel in structure, and there was little provision for transfer between the two.
sectors of society traditionally tended to prefer the academic course of study, which was regarded as more prestigious.
a result, academic secondary education had expanded more rapidly than technical education in the second half of the twentieth century.
1987 there were 276 general secondary schools in Uruguay, including 118 private schools.
addition, ninety-four technical education schools had a total enrollment of 52,766 students in 1987.
1988 about 69 percent of university students were from Montevideo.
number of university students continued to grow rapidly, from nearly 22,000 in 1970 to over 61,000 in 1988.
was one reason that the student population was so large yet the number of graduates relatively low.
1986 only 3,654 students (2,188 women and 1,455 men) graduated from university, whereas 16,878 entered that year.
continued to note the discrepancy between university training and job opportunities, particularly in the prestigious fields.
gap contributed to the substantial level of emigration of the best-educated young Uruguayan professionals.
model adopted for public schools was taken from the French system, and a centralized, nationwide system was established.
this system was adopted in the 1990’s, many non-public schools were established.
rigid separation into three branches of education grew up—primary, secondary, and university.
training for grade school teachers was connected to the primary school system.
National Institute of Technical Education (Instituto Nacional de Educación Técnica—INET) grew up as an extension of the secondary school system.
the late 1950s, all three branches of the education system had established administrative autonomy, including complete control over their budgets.
the late 1960s, Uruguayan secondary schools and the various faculties of the University of the Republic had become extremely politicized.
1973 the authorities vowed to put an end to this situation, and political purges in the education system became widespread.
teachers were able to find work in private schools, but others either left the profession or emigrated.
branches of the university, such as the Institute of Social Sciences, were closed for a time.
1973, the year in which Uruguay descended into authoritarian rule, major changes were decreed in the education system.
the same time, the compulsory length of schooling was raised from six to nine years.

typography refers to the use of fonts on the World Wide Web.
HTML was first created, font faces and styles were controlled exclusively by the settings of each Web browser.
first Cascading Style Sheets specification was published in 1996 and provided the same capabilities.
techniques did not gain much use, and were removed in the CSS2.1 specification.
Internet Explorer added support for the font downloading feature in version 4.0, released in 1997.
has subsequently increased interest in Web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.
the first CSS specification, authors specified font characteristics via a series of properties:
high penetration rate has made them a staple for Web designers.
CSS2 font properties were removed from CSS2.1 and later included in CSS3.
CSS specification allows for multiple fonts to be listed as fallback fonts.
CSS, the codice_1 property accepts a list of comma-separated font faces to use, like so:
this font is not available, the Web browser attempts to use the next font in the list.
none of the fonts specified are found, the browser displays its default font.
families are designed to split fonts into several categories based on their general appearance.
technique to download remote fonts was first specified in the CSS2 specification, which introduced the codice_7 rule.
could result in fonts being used against the terms of their license or illegally spread through the Web.
(PFR), Embedded OpenType (EOT) and Web Open Font Format (WOFF) are formats designed to address these issues.
the releases of Firefox 3.5, Opera 10 and Safari 3.1, usage employing other formats was expected to increase.

Hoefler& Co. offer a proprietary font delivery system rooted in the cloud.
this does not interfere with fonts and foundries under free licences.
while not specifically a webfont specification, was the first standard for embedding fonts.
was developed by the type foundry Bitstream in 1994, and became natively supported in Netscape Navigator 4, in 1996.

common hurdle in Web design is the design of mockups that include fonts that are not Web-safe.
common solution is to replace the text with a similar Web-safe font or use a series of similar-looking fallback fonts.
practice involves overlaying text with an image containing the same text written in the desired font.
is good for aesthetic purposes, but prevents text selection, increases bandwidth use, and is bad for search engine optimization.
common is the use of Flash-based solutions such as sIFR.
is similar to image replacement techniques, though the text is selectable and rendered as a vector.
this method requires the presence of a proprietary plugin on a client's system.
solution is using Javascript to replace the text with VML (for Internet Explorer) or SVG (for all other browsers).
hosting services allow users to pay a subscription to host non-Web-safe fonts online.
services host the font for the user and provide the necessary@font-face CSS declaration.

this period conflict developed from minor raids to major conflicts, incorporating many of the innovations of continental warfare.
arrival of the Vikings brought a new scale of naval warfare, with rapid movement based around the Viking longship.
Birlinn, which developed from the longship, became a major factor in warfare in the Highlands and Islands.
"livery and maintenance" castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons.
the politically divided world of early medieval Scotland the nucleus of most armed forces was a leader's bodyguard or war-band.
the end of World War II, Nazi leaders fled, relocating all over the world.
by sectarianism, Iraq’s armed forces have become unable and unwilling to fight.
the British language, this was called the "teulu", as in "teulu Dewr" (the "War-band of Deira").
peace-time, the war-band's activity was centred around the "Great Hall".
war-band was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size.
wider forces depended on the obligations to defend a province or kingdom by land and sea.
stones, like that at Aberlemno in Angus, show warriors with swords, spears, bows, helmets and shields.
appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.
were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around.
produced relatively large numbers of men serving for a limited period, usually as unarmoured or poorly armoured bowmen and spearmen.
also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of feudal troops.
introduction of feudalism to Scotland is usually attributed to the Davidian Revolution of the twelfth century.
Barrow wrote that among other changes this brought "fundamental innovations in military organization".
varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.
could fight at sea, but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies.
they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape.
process probably began in the thirteenth century, but would be intensified under Robert I.
are mentions in Medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including William the Lion and Alexander II.
indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr, but he avoided a sea battle.
it has been pointed out that Scottish medieval armies had probably always been dependent on infantry forces.
practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred.
systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears.
were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield.
archers were mainly drawn from the border regions, with those from Selkirk Forest gaining a particularly reputation.
largest number of Late Medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles, about 800, were of the tower house design.
versions of tower houses in southern Scotland were known as peel towers, or pele houses.
the end of the period royal builders in Scotland adopted European Renaissance styles in castle design.
these were adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl).
Wars of Independence brought the first recorded instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland.
I used a range of siege engines, which were carefully constructed, transported, deployed, dismantled and stored for reuse.
destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender.
also deployed lighter bolt-shooting balistas, belfry siege towers and on one occasion a covered sow.
of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick, the future Robert I, who was present on the English side.
armies, with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault, blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics.
disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I.
English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade.
first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341.
artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century.
Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train.
these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland.
IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511.
of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands.
naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315.
were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.
the establishment of Scottish independence, Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity.
the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.
office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period.
upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie.
the Flodden campaign the fleet consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft.
a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war.
lasting significance of the Chicano Movement on contemporary Chicano/a writers and artists cannot be overstated.
in any movement there is a need for signage that brings awareness to the issues at hand, starting with murals.
represented the main form of activism in Mexico prior to the Chicano Movement taking place in the United States.
Plan Espiritual de Aztlan understood art as a vehicle of the movement and of revolutionary culture”.
immigration and displacement are a common themes in Chicano art.
common theme is the labor exploitation in agricultural, domestic work, and service industry jobs, particularly of the undocumented.
has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs.
Chicano People’s Park (Chicano Park) in San Diego highlights the importance of activism to Chicano art.
many years, Barrio Logan Heights petitioned for a park to be built in their community, but were ignored.
this park is full of murals and most of them refer to the history of the Chicanos.
of them include Cesar Chavez, La Virgen de Guadalupe and many others.
extensive negotiations, the city finally agreed to the development of a community park in their reclamation of their territory.
the words of poets, to the streets of Skid Row...murals are still storytellers with some bite.
expressed through the Chicano Peoples'Park, community-orientation and foundation is another essential element to Chicano art.
created by Chicano artists reclaim public spaces, encourage community participation, and aid in neighborhood development and beautification.
communities of Mexican descent within the United States, the shared social space has often been a public space.
art has developed into two major mediums– muralism and cultural art centers.
art has drawn much influence from prominent muralists from the Mexican Renaissance, such as Diego Rivera and José Orozco.
art was also influenced by pre-Columbian art, where history and rituals were encoded on the walls of pyramids.
not only addresses public availability to the community, but also includes meaningful content, always speaking to the Chicano experience.
again ensure accessibility and relevance, cultural art centers were located in their immediate community.
Graphics offered apprenticeship opportunities, work alongside an experienced silkscreen printer, or‘master printer,'to develop their own limited-edition silkscreen print.
150 teenagers attended daily art classes taught by Ochoa and graffiti declined significantly.
art affirms their cultural identity through religious iconography and key elements of their Mexican, U.S., and indigenous cultures.
and indigenous culture is celebrated through the practices of their ancestors (shrines, dance, murals, etc.).
of the most celebrated holidays in Mexican culture is the Day of the Dead.
holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember family and friends who have died.
these roots, the emergence of radiant Chicano art were traced.
from Chicanos for equality and social justice have roots in this long history of loss and displacement.
Chicanos preserve their connection to their Aztec heritage by incorporating Aztec imagery (Quetzalcoatl, goddesses and gods, livelihood, temples, etc.)
their art, from murals to prints to performance dance to music, as a way for historical and cultural affirmation.
the barrios, as ethnic enclaves, have long histories of dislocation, marginalization, poverty, and inequity in access social services.
originated in the 1930s and blossomed in Southwestern Chicano communities during the post-war prosperity of the‘50s.
this method was quickly replaced by lowering blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed frames and drop spindles.
customizations consist of sun visors, fender skirts, bug deflectors, and swamp coolers.
or chrome spoke wheels or rims such as Astro Supremes, Cragers, Tru spokes, Crowns, Daytons and Zeniths are also common.
the early 1990s, lowriders have become common in urban youth culture in general, primarily in West Coast hip hop.
in the barrio also incorporates graffiti as a form of artistic expression, often associated with subcultures that rebel against authority.
here, although graffiti remains the major form of street art, other mediums have evolved- including stenciling, stickers, and wheatpasting.
members also often use graffiti to designate membership, differentiate rivals and alliances, and mark ideological borders.
of gang-related graffiti often consists of cryptic symbols and initials with unique calligraphy styles.
to other forms of art within the Chicano Movement (silk-screen printing, murals, etc.
is now commonly recognized as a form of public art, embraced by museums, art critics, and art institutions.
everyday materials, such as paper plates, and elevating it into art, is one type of rasquachismo.

deals with two main areas of creativity: Ideation of new ideas, and problem solving.
high rate of ideas per unit of time was considered an indication of creativity.
former parallel drawn between quantity and quality appears to no longer hold true.
of the characteristics of organized thinking is a state of“low stimuli”, unencumbered by a large quantity of ideas.
organized or structured approach to idea generation is the starting point for Systematic Inventive Thinking.
main discovery was that creative solutions incorporate an elimination of a conflict in the problem state.
types of hints are used: principles, standards and physical effects.
are 40 principles; each help with defining high level strategies for solving the problem.
are 70 standards, which are more elaborated ideas based on collective past solutions.
the 1970s, one of Altshuller's students, Ginadi Filkovsky, immigrated to Israel and joined the Open University in Tel Aviv.
began teaching TRIZ and adapting it to the needs of both Israeli and international hi-tech companies.
Ph.D. students, Jacob Goldenberg and Roni Horowitz, joined Filkovsky, focusing their research on developing and simplifying the methodology.
work formed the basis of the SIT method as it exists today.
in contrast to SIT, this principle is scattered around the method.
is particularly applicable when the template approach is applied to problem solving.
first step in using SIT for Problem Solving is to define the problem world.
an essential component from a product and find uses for the newly envisioned arrangement of the existing components.
to a product a component of the same type as an existing component.
2 keywords for this tool are: 1) more and 2) different.

affluent cultures are more likely to adopt the Task Unification mindset.
are easy to identify as those characteristics that can change within a product or component (e.g.
first step in using SIT is to define the problem world.
also can turn every real problem into an amusing puzzle.
Closed World condition deals with the resemblance between the problem world and the solution world.
condition forces us to rely on resources already at our disposal, rather than "importing" new external resources for the solution.
Closed World condition, by contrast, forces the thinker to find a creative solution by heavily limiting the space of possibilities.
other words, a problematic element in a situation is neutralized, so it no longer presents an obstacle.
needs, however, are never ignored– they are simply introduced at a later stage.
Function Follows Form principle is applied as an overarching framework to focus the application SIT’s Thinking Tools.
follows form is a principle associated with classic architecture, and it is also being used in government buildings.
nature, water cascading down a mountain will always follow the path of least resistance– the easiest route.
thinking, too, our minds tend to take the path of least resistance– those avenues most familiar to us.
doing, it is difficult to arrive at ideas new to us or to our competitors.
encourages an approach to the counter-intuitive path– the path of most resistance.
example, why do TV controls always have to be on the lower part of the TV set?
it not be easier if they were on the upper part?
television sets were first introduced, the controls were potentiometers made out of wax.
since then, new generations of TV sets are available, and still one would find the controls on the lower part.
the "sweet spot" requires a balance that leads to both ingenious and viable ideas.
notion was expressed in a Harvard Business Review Article entitles“Finding Your Innovation Sweet Spot”.
we innovate we push our thinking outward, trying to create something new and different from what we have now.
SIT thinking process uses the FFF procedure and the five thinking tools in order to generate new forms (virtual products).
"closed world" condition for example acts as an inhibitor, making sure we don't wander too far out.
combination of opposite forces keeps us ideating in the sweet zone.
templates may contribute to the understanding and prediction of new product emergence.
invention of new products has traditionally involved methods that encourage the generation of large numbers of ideas.
even if they prove productive, the patterns are likely to be idiosyncratic and, quite often, not even verbally definable.
usual process of developing new products begins with a definition of market need.
will begin in product markets, rather than in the labor market.
is done based on intuition or on market analysis, focus groups etc.
defining the needs, a process is begun of developing products to address these needs.
order to overcome these problems, the SIT method suggests starting the process of product development from the product itself.
systematic thinking tools in analyzing the product can lead to potential new products or to a definition of new needs.
of the important elements of SIT is to characterize the system and environmental variables.
methodology is most often taught through programs on Innovation; Business Administration; Marketing; Organizational Development; Leadership; Management Studies.
goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe and healthy work environment.
may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment.
common-law jurisdictions, employers have a common law duty to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees.
1950, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health.
research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon.

protective equipment can help protect against many of these hazards.
hazards (biohazards) include infectious microorganisms such as viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax.
affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad population of workers.
care workers, including veterinary health workers, risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens and various infectious diseases, especially those that are emerging.
such as regulatory agencies set occupational exposure limits to mitigate the risk of chemical hazards.
international effort is investigating the health effects of mixtures of chemicals.
is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals.
occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry.
workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of drowning.
are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.
and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations.
rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector.
nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed.
industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery.
causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.

these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information.
occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a risk assessment be carried out prior to making an intervention.
assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices.
recommended controls are implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine of it has been lowered to an acceptable level.

details about the Commission are available at their official webpage.
broad contour of that framework is outlined in the Approach Paper released by the Commission on 4 October 2012.
institutional framework governing the financial sector has been built up over a century.
are over 60 Acts and multiple rules and regulations that govern the financial sector.
of the financial sector laws date back several decades, when the financial landscape was very different from that seen today.
example, the RBI Act and the Insurance Act are of 1934 and 1938 vintage respectively.
Securities Contract Regulation Act was enacted in 1956, when derivatives and statutory regulators were unknown.
piecemeal changes have induced complex and cumbersome legislation, and raised difficulties in harmonising contradictory provisions.
harmonisation is imperative for effectively regulating a dynamic market in the era of financial globalisation.
emphasis in Europe has been on regulating financial markets with a view to moderating future crises.
piecemeal amendments have generated unintended outcomes including regulatory gaps, overlaps, inconsistencies and regulatory arbitrage.
instance, complex financial intermediation by financial conglomerates of today falls under the purview of multiple regulators with gaps and overlaps.
remit of FSLRC, as contained in its Terms of Reference (ToR), comprises the following:
Approach Paper is the outcome of these deliberations and substantive research work.
shows the contours of the legal-institutional framework that the FSLRC may recommend.
WGs consisted of sector experts who created their own report with relevant recommendations which were submitted to the Commission.
Commission is supported by expert consultants in the fields of economics, finance, law and related areas.
will write subordinated legislation which could either utilise detailed prescriptive rules or be principles-based, depending on the
combination of legislation and subordinated legislation should yield a body of law that evolves smoothly over time.
Commission would want laws to hold financial firms to a higher standard: that of complying with the principles.
model of the proposed regulatory architecture will comprise the following agencies:
present DICGC will be subsumed into the Resolution Corporation which will work across the financial system.
Financial Redressal Agency (FRA) is a new agency which will have to be created in implementing this financial regulatory architecture.
the existing FSDC will have modified functions in the fields of systemic risk and development.
critical pillar of financial law is the construction of independent regulators and their functioning.
FSLRC analysed the governance puzzles of establishing sound independent regulators, which involves the twin goals of independence and accountability.
to the issue of independence, there are four arguments in favour of independence:
the same time, independence cannot be given to an agency in isolation.
should not delegate power to unelected officials without adequate accountability mechanisms.
channels of accountability need to be constructed as independent agencies are not subject to accountability through elections.
was the accountability mechanism through which the independent agency was brought under check.
most other areas of financial law, the accountability mechanisms required are much more complex.
will yield substantial gains for the Indian economy when compared with the present arrangements.
independence is not an unmixed blessing: when unelected officials are given power, this needs to be accompanied by accountability mechanisms.
will help ensure that adequate analysis has preceded rule-making, and show the full regulatory intent to citizens and judges.
an independent regulator comes into being through a well drafted law, this law contains specific objectives and specific powers.
is not an end in itself; it exists in order to address market failures.
of financial services are often more vulnerable than consumers of ordinary goods and require a special effort by the State.
present body of financial law is not animated by consumer protection.
Commission believes this is a major gap in Indian financial law and regulation, which needs to be addressed.
details of consumer protection would, of course, lie in the subordinated legislation that financial regulators would draft.
proposed law will clearly pose this question to the regulator.
this rule-making mandate, there would be a supervisory function to ensure compliance with these rules.
problems would be reduced by having a single principles-based law which would cover the entire financial system.
will propose the creation of a unified Financial Redressal Agency (FRA).
would have front-ends in every district of India, where consumers of all financial products would be able to submit complaints.
technology would be used to connect up these front-ends into a centralised light-weight adjudication process.
well structured workflow process would support speedy and fair handling of cases.
is the efforts by financial regulators to reduce the probability that a financial firm collapses.
addition, if a large number of financial firms fail at the same time, this can disrupt the overall financial system.
principle of proportionality will apply: regulatory interventions should be related to the risks faced.
regulators may enforce the law for various components of the financial system.
around the world have worked hard to make the financial system safer.
it is important to ensure smooth functioning of the economy, and avoid disruptive firm failure.
the case of banks, the deposit insurance program (where all households are guaranteed up to Rs.
of their bank deposits) would be operated by the resolution corporation.
key feature of the resolution corporation will be speed of action.
must stop a financial firm while the firm is not yet bankrupt.
grand question of this field is the appropriate sequencing and pace of India's capital account liberalisation.
prosperous countries have negligible capital controls, and India's peers among developing countries have greater capital account openness than India.
Indian policy makers have repeatedly stated, in the long run, India will move towards capital account openness.
Commission will leave the timing and sequencing of capital account liberalisation entirely to policy makers.
possible approach in justifying capital controls lies in the argument that conditions in the global economy are sometimes turbulent.
controls could then be useful as a tool for shielding India from those problems.
economic purpose for capital controls suggests the use of temporary capital controls, which are brought in during certain periods.
controls can either be structured as detailed microeconomic interventions (e.g.
rules about margin payment by foreign investors trading on exchanges) or they can be structured as macroeconomic instruments (e.g.
should the law, that is enacted by Parliament, place the functions of rule-making and supervision for capital controls?
of FDI in multi-brand retail) are determined by the government.
capital account restrictions are analogous to protectionism in the financial sector.
with liberalisation of trade, capital account decontrol involves analysing the political ramifications of gainers and losers from liberalisation.
drafting of subordinated legislation under the capital controls law) should be placed with the Ministry of Finance or the RBI.
Commission will debate these questions, which define the basic character of capital controls law.
problem of systemic risk requires a bird's eye perspective of the financial system.
first function in this field is that of reducing the probability of a breakdown of the financial system.
financial regulator tends to focus on regulating and supervising some components of the financial system.
sectoral regulation, financial regulators sometimes share the worldview of their regulated entities.
that impact on multiple sectors need to be swiftly taken, and correctly enforced by multiple different agencies.
management might involve utilising taxpayer resources, which can only be authorised by the government.
Commission will debate these questions, and will take a view on them, and make recommendations accordingly.
uniquely important policy problem in India is that of financial inclusion.
fundamentals of public administration suggest that quasi-fiscal functions should only be performed by the fiscal authority.
could be achieved by placing rule-making functions related to development (e.g.
for priority sector lending) closer to the fiscal authority, while asking regulatory agencies to verify compliance (i.e.
open question in the field concerns the institutional mechanism through which this could be achieved.
that derives its value because the State asserts that it is legal tender.
policy independence is required, in order to avoid election-related cycles in monetary policy.
this independence, an accountability mechanism needs to be set up.
mainstream strategy that is used worldwide is that of tasking the monetary authority with achieving price stability.
management of public debt requires a specialised investment banking capability.
series of expert committees have suggested that this should be done in a professional debt management office for two reasons:
FSLRC has looked into the necessity of keeping these sector specific rules and will retain them only under special circumstances.
regarding enforceability of derivative contracts have to be laid down.
priority of clearing houses in the bankruptcy process needs to be examined.
the over-the-counter market also comes with its own set of contractual issues.
the release of the FSLRC Approach Paper an extensive debate has taken place on the Commission's proposed suggestions.
plenty responses were positive and encouraged the Commission's work, strong oppositions on some fundamental issues have also come up.
FSLRC has also suggested some big changes for the RBI.
call to cut back some of its powers and redefining its objectives met significant resistance.

academic researchers contend that Oakland's history of under-realized industrialization led to the emergence of a food desert.
public advocacy groups and community-based organizations has emerged as a part of the food desert movement in West Oakland.
is no standard definition or agreed upon set of qualifications for an area to be designated as a "food desert".
proximity to San Francisco made it a desirable location for both industry and residency.
housing became increasingly concentrated in Oakland because of its proximity to the railway terminus, shipping ports, and the city center.
residential, and agricultural development continued in the area through the 1920s.
developers consolidated land purchases, subdivision and construction, vast tracts of small, single-family homes became prevalent in the East Bay.
suburbanization was highly racialized however, as African Americans and other racial minorities were typically denied access to such loans.
housing covenants continued to concentrate the growing African American population to the West Oakland neighborhood throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
historical paradigm of“supermarket redlining” is widely considered an extremely influential factor in the occurrence of food deserts.

low-accessibility to healthy food bears significant health and disease consequences on the residents of the West Oakland food desert.
are contesting definitions of accessibility when applied to food deserts in West Oakland.
inadequate access is defined as accessibility in a certain area relative to other areas.
can be measured by distance and density of supermarkets or by the ownership of cars.
to the USDA, ownership of a car is the best factor to measure accessibility of both rural and urban populations.
and Horel, however, point out that distance and density measures only indicate“potential access” and not“realized access”.
diseases can be prevented if residents are to reach the right resources, such as affordable supermarkets and a healthy diet.
further explained by Robert Gottlieg, the food justice movement is linked to other movements addressing injustice:
affordability and accessibility to healthy foods are linked to race, ethnicity and social-economic disparities.
may require changes in zoning and economic incentives for investment.

occur in amplifiers due to decreasing amplification and changing phase when operated near saturation.
behavior is commonly referred to as gain or phase compression.
resulting behavior is commonly referred to as gain or phase expansion.
signal to be amplified is first passed through the linearizer, distorting the signal, with no loss in gain.
distorted signal is then fed to the High-Powered Amplifier to be amplified.
distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier negates the distortion introduced by the linearizer producing a near linear transfer characteristic.
gain compression of the amplifier starts above a certain input power level (red curve).
practice, the linear output power level of an amplifier increases significantly (up to four times).
output soared to 40 times its level at the beginning of the twentieth century.
increased linear operating range is also illustrated in "Figure 2" (light blue area).
chart shows the relationship between input and output power of an amplifier with and without pre-distortion linearizer.

Engine Systems Inc. (SES) is a Canadian aerospace company led by Pradeep Dass and is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
compressors, gear boxes, and other related technologies being developed are integrated into SES's major R&D projects.
Dass has been involved in the development of the engine for over 20 years.
May 10, 2012, SES publicly announced the launch of their company at the Farnborough Air Show (July 9–15, 2012).
August 6, they announced their participation in the AUVSI’s Unmanned Systems North America.
of the engine can be used for propulsion of an SSTO vehicle, long-range missiles, and hypersonic transport aircraft.
engine is being developed with the flexibility for various vehicles and mission profiles.
can rise above the material limits of the compressor blades in a conventional turbojet.
DASS engine concept improves upon the heat exchange process in multiple ways.
nanoparticles are seeded into the intake air from the inlet cone to further enhance heat transfer.
particles act as a supplemental fuel and assist the operation of flow control devices downstream.
combination of hydrogen and nanoparticles of Boron are being considered as the engine's fuel.
specific impulse ("I") of air-breathing engines are superior to rockets over a wide range of Mach numbers.
gains have the potential to realize a larger payload mass fraction (e.g.
potential gains from a larger female workforce are striking.
for NASP to LEO vs 2.6% for Soyuz-2 to LEO).
higher "I" associated with air-breathing engines is a major motivation for the development of supersonic combustion ramjet engines.
engines typically have a lower thrust-to-weight ratio compared to rockets.
is why the DASS engine will be integrated into a lifting-body vehicle.
an SSTO vehicle, reduced vehicle mass and increased payload mass fraction translates to lower operation costs.
transport, the ability to travel at hypersonic speeds drastically decreases the time required to cover long distances.
lower air density at these higher altitudes reduces the overall vehicle drag, which further improves efficiency.
research and development is focused on engine operation at Mach 5 cruise at an altitude of 30 km.
for the DASS Engine to operate beyond the target 30 km and Mach 5 operating conditions, the design will be modified.
higher altitudes the air density decreases and the vehicle must travel faster to achieve a sufficient inlet mass capture.
low flight speeds the DASS engine relies solely on the on-board turbojet that runs on a conventional hydrocarbon fuel.
this mode, the bypass is closed and all air is processed through the turbojet core.
exhaust nozzle (patent pending) contracts in the subsonic mode for optimal specific thrust.
the engine accelerates to supersonic velocities, the articulated portions of the intake direct flow into the heat exchanger (patent pending).
hydrogen fuel is passed through the heat exchanger, decreasing the temperature of the air prior to engine compression.
that the magnitude of heat transfer is coupled to the amount of hydrogen available for combustion in the afterburner.
combustion products are then expanded through a supersonic nozzle, variable geometry nozzle.
engine will be designed to completely consume the air to optimize for thrust.
engine can operate at Mach 4 and provide thrust in excess of a conventional ramjet.
high Mach numbers (~4.88) air cannot be cooled below the turbojet limit (1200K).
a result, no combustion can occur in the core turbojet and the engine must transition into a pure ramjet mode.
engine still realizes an efficiency boost from the cooling effects of the heat exchanger (albeit much less in this mode).
terminal flight speed is limited to that of a hydrogen fueled ramjet.
engine will operate on multiple fuels (hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and metallic fuels).
hydrocarbon fuel is typically used in turbojet/turbofan engines, which are considered mature/conventional technology.
has a large heat capacity (~14 kJ/kgK), so it is an excellent heat sink for the heat exchanger (patent pending).
also has the best energy content per unit mass of any fuel and is a light molecule.
a result, it can provide large thrust levels with a low specific fuel consumption.
fuel has excellent storage qualities, high energy content per unit volume, and can assist in convective heat transfer.
technology components of the DASS GN 1 and DASS GN X are quite similar.
DASS GN1 is meant exclusively for aerospace and the DASS GN X is meant for space applications only.
table below shows a comparison of the DASS engine to more conventional high-speed engines (Ramjet) at two Mach numbers.
first Ramjet uses a combination of fuels (Kerosene and hydrogen) in similar proportions as the DASS engine.
is clear that at the lower Mach number, the DASS engine provides a higher specific thrust.
is due to higher pressure that can be utilized by the turbojet.
Mach 4 the DASS GN1 performs similarly to a ramjet.
this speed, the DASS GN1 engine would likely convert to a pure ramjet.
typical rocket specific impulse is between 250– 500 seconds.
of the main challenges is to develop a technique to inject the nano-particles in a manner which promotes homogeneous mixing.
a small amount of nanoparticles are required to provide the heat transfer gains required by the engine.
was found that even with very small mass loadings (0.1%), large gains in heat transfer can be achieved (40%).
it is feasible to use the available hydrogen as a carrier for the particles.
nanoparticles outperform hydrogen (per unit volume) and hydrocarbons (per unit mass and volume) in terms of energy storage.
important metrics are the energy per unit mass and energy per unit volume.
are usually designed on a per unit volume basis (for drag considerations).
a per unit volume basis, Boron outperforms both hydrogen and hydrocarbons.
a per unit mass basis, Boron outperforms hydrocarbon fuels but is not as good as hydrogen.
the DASS engines will take advantage of the excellent properties of Boron along with hydrocarbon, and hydrogen fuels.
proposed structure of the heat exchanger is a nano-porous foam.
foam will strengthen the nano-porous structure while maximizing the heat transfer and minimizing the pressure drop.
in combination with the added effect of nano-particle dispersion should allow for a smaller heat exchanger.
technology hurdles for the DASS engine are related to the implementation of nanotechnology in the engine components.
Canadian Government (through NSERC funding) is also a partner in the DASS Engine project.
mechanisms have been proposed, including the increase in the overall surface area associated with nano-coating.
it is possible that the nanoparticles act as small scale fins, which are known to improve heat exchanger effectiveness.
reduces the work requirements in pumping or compressing the fluid as it passes through the heat exchanger.
presence of surface roughness associated with nanoparticle deposits also promotes mixing, which directly affects convective heat transfer.
suspension of a large amount of small scale solid particles in a gas results in a large surface-area-to-volume ratio.
end result, which is not observed with larger scale particles (i.e.
is the alteration of the properties of the bulk fluid.
will investigate the potential enhancement of the thermal conductivity of gases with suspended nanoparticles.
contrast, metal particles can be packed and stored efficiently and safely.

RAF had an excellent training program (using bases in Canada), maintained very high aircrew morale, and inculcated a fighting spirit.
officers monitored battles by radar, and directed planes by radio to where they were most needed.
RAF's success convinced Eisenhower that its system maximized the effectiveness of tactical air power; Ike became a true believer.

classical time period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization.
atmosphere is an international public good and GHG emissions are an international externality (Goldemberg"et al.
change in the quality of the atmosphere, "A", does not affect the welfare of all individuals and countries equally.
other words, some individuals and countries may benefit from climate change, but others may lose out.
emissions are unevenly distributed around the world, as are the potential impacts of climate change (Toth"et al.
with higher than average emissions that face potentially small negative/positive climate change impacts have little incentive to reduce their emissions.
of climate change can be considered a transfer of wealth from the present generation to future generations (Toth"et al.
amount of mitigation determines the composition of resources (e.g., environmental or material) that future generations receive.
of carbon dioxide (CO) might be irreversible on the time scale of millennia (Halsnæs"et al.
are risks of irreversible climate changes, and the possibility of sudden changes in climate.
the other hand, these effects are also true of mitigation efforts.
the scientific basis for these investments turns out to be wrong, they would become "stranded" assets.
the costs of reducing emissions may change over time in a non-linear fashion.
an economic perspective, as the scale of private sector investment in low-carbon technologies increases, so do the risks.
private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of stall speed.
over future climate policy decisions makes investors reluctant to undertake large-scale investment without upfront government support.
later section on finance discusses how risk affects investment in developing and emerging economies.
definition implicitly assumes that resources can be substituted, a view which is supported by economic history.
view is that reductions in some exhaustible resources can only be partially made up for by substitutes.
true, this might mean then some assets need to be preserved at all costs.
remedy for this would be for developed countries to pay all the costs of mitigation, including costs in developing countries.
solution is suggested by both Rawlsian and utilitarian constructs of the social welfare function.
functions are used to assess the welfare impacts on all individuals of climate change and related policies (Markandya"et al.
growth is a key driver of CO emissions (Sathaye"et al.
the economy expands, demand for energy and energy-intensive goods increases, pushing up CO emissions.
the other hand, economic growth may drive technological change and increase energy efficiency.
specialization is in energy-intensive sectors, then there might be a strong link between economic growth and emissions growth.
should be clear to everyone that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use.
technological change or energy efficiency improvements, specialization in high or low energy intensity sectors does not affect global emissions.
it was suggested that there was some degree of flexibility between economic growth and emissions growth.
gave the example of China, which has made structural reforms with the aim of increasing GDP.
policies have mainly been designed to increase competition in the market, but they can have a significant impact on emissions.
concluded that structural reform of the energy sector could not guarantee a shift towards less carbon-intensive power generation.
could, however, allow the market to be more responsive to price signals placed on emissions.
Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty designed to reduce emissions of GHGs.
Kyoto Protocol sets legally-blinding emissions limitations for developed countries ("Annex I Parties") out to 2008-2012.
US has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and its target is therefore non-binding.
economics of the Kyoto Protocol is discussed in Views on the Kyoto Protocol and Flexible mechanisms#Views on the flexibility mechanisms.
estimates for the treaty are summarized at Kyoto Protocol#Cost estimates.
analysis of the CDM is available at Clean Development Mechanism.
summarize, the caps agreed to in Kyoto's first commitment period (2008-2012) have turned out to be too weak.
of the surplus allowances have been bought from the EITs, but overall little trading has taken place.
have mainly concentrated on meeting their targets domestically, and through the use of the CDM.
countries have implemented domestic energy/carbon taxes (see carbon tax for details) and emissions trading schemes (ETSs).
reducing the energy and carbon intensity of future growth;
individual articles on the various ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes- see Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading for a list.
Kyoto treaty does not set a global price for carbon.
the treaty does not place caps on emissions in developing countries.
lack of caps for developing countries was based on equity (fairness) considerations (see Kyoto Protocol#Negotiations for more information).
countries, however, have undertaken a range of policies to reduce their emissions domestically.
later Cancún agreement, agreed under the UNFCCC, is based on voluntary pledges rather than binding commitments.
UNFCCC has agreed that future global warming should be limited to below 2 °C relative to the pre-industrial temperature.
the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate efficiency from equity (Goldemberg"et al.
p. 34) suggested a number of policies to improve efficiency, including:
of the aspects of efficiency for an international agreement on reducing emissions is participation.
participation significantly reduces the effectiveness of policies to reduce emissions.
is because of how the global economy is connected through trade.
equilibrium theory points to a number of difficulties with partial participation (p. 31).
are of "leakage" (carbon leakage) of emissions from countries with regulations on GHG emissions to countries with less regulation.
example, stringent regulation in developed countries could result in polluting industries such as aluminium production moving production to developing countries.
many developing countries, there are no regulations for data privacy at all.
have suggested that spillover might be beneficial and result in reduced emission intensities in developing countries.
also requires that the costs of emission reductions be minimized (Goldemberg"et al.
considered as part of a policy to reduce emissions, and also that carbon sinks are included.
requires that the marginal costs of mitigation for each of these components is equal.
efficiency, there is no consensus view of how to assess the fairness of a particular climate policy (Bashmakov "et al.".
see also economics of global warming#Paying for an international public good).
does not prevent the study of how a particular policy impacts welfare.
a global tradable quota system, welfare impacts would vary according to quota allocation.
4.2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change commits industrialized countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing emissions.
a new method is being developed to help ensure that funding is available for climate change mitigation.
involves financial leveraging, whereby public financing is used to encourage private investment.
by cutting public investment, they are hindering private investment.
costs of mitigation and adaptation policies can be measured as a change in GDP.
problem with this method of assessing costs is that GDP is an imperfect measure of welfare (Markandya"et al.
can be made to GDP estimates to allow for these problems, but they are difficult to calculate.
response to this problem, some have suggested using other methods to assess policy.
emissions baseline is, by definition, the emissions that would occur in the absence of policy intervention.
of the baseline scenario is critical in the assessment of mitigation costs (Markandya"et al.
because the baseline determines the potential for emissions reductions, and the costs of implementing emission reduction policies.
are several concepts used in the literature over baselines, including the "efficient" and "business-as-usual" (BAU) baseline cases.
the efficient baseline, it is assumed that all resources are being employed efficiently.
high emission BAU baselines imply relatively low net mitigation costs per unit of emissions.
the BAU scenario projects a large growth in emissions, total mitigation costs can be relatively high.
in an efficient baseline, mitigation costs per unit of emissions can be relatively high, but total mitigation costs low.
mortality and morbidity costs are potentially a major ancillary benefit of mitigation.
benefit is associated with reduced use of fossil fuels, thereby resulting in less air pollution (Barker"et al.
is the ability to reduce emissions at the lowest cost.
carbon sinks in a policy framework is another source of flexibility.
planting and forestry management actions can increase the capacity of sinks.
is, however, uncertainty over how net emissions are affected by activities in this area (Markandya"et al.
are, by definition, emission reduction options that have net negative costs (Markandya"et al.
presumption of no regret options affects emission reduction cost estimates (p. 455).
convention, estimates of emission reduction costs do not include the benefits of avoided climate change damages.
the costs of implementing policies are less than the benefits, a no regret option (negative cost) is identified.
magnitude of potential technological efficiency improvements depends on assumptions about future technological innovation and market penetration rates for these technologies.
climate change impacts and mitigation policies involves a comparison of economic flows that occur in different points in time.
discount rate is used by economists to compare economic effects occurring at different times.
discount rate is generally positive because resources invested today can, on average, be transformed into more resources later.
choice of discount rate has a large effect on the result of any climate change cost analysis (Halsnæs"et al.
discount rates used in assessing mitigation programmes need to at least partly reflect the opportunity costs of capital.
deciding how to discount future climate change impacts, value judgements are necessary (Arrow"et al.
(2001a:9) found that there was no consensus on the use of long-term discount rates in this area.
is a quantitative type of analysis that is used to assess different potential decisions.
of the benefits of decision analysis is that the analysis is reproducible.
concluded that while decision analysis had value, it could not identify a globally optimal policy for mitigation.
determining nationally optimal mitigation policies, the problems of decision analysis were viewed as being less important.
means that the costs and benefits of preventing (abating) the emission of the last unit of CO-eq are being compared.
result can change if the damage function is changed to include the possibility of catastrophic climate change impacts.
energy subsidies are present in many countries (Barker"et al.
of these subsidies would substantially reduce GHG emissions and stimulate economic growth.
was for an emissions pathway consistent with atmospheric stabilization of GHGs between 445 and 710 ppm CO-eq.
cost estimates were supported by a moderate amount of evidence and much agreement in the literature (IPCC, 2007b:11,18).
relaxation of some or all these assumptions would lead to an appreciable increase in cost estimates.
most of the assessed studies, costs rose for increasingly stringent stabilization targets.
scenarios that had high baseline emissions, mitigation costs were generally higher for comparable stabilization targets.
scenarios with low emissions baselines, mitigation costs were generally lower for comparable stabilization targets.
assessed studies where estimates are given for regional mitigation costs.
predicted that the renewables sector could potentially benefit from mitigation.
Vancouver serves as the largest metropolitan area in Western Canada, Calgary serves as the largest city.
following is a list of these areas and their populations as of 2011.
Canada consists of the country's four westernmost provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
covers 2.9 million square kilometres– almost 29% of Canada’s land area.
Alberta and Saskatchewan are landlocked between British Columbia and Manitoba.
Canadian Prairies are part of a vast sedimentary plain covering much of Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba.
prairies form a significant portion of the land area of Western Canada.
continental divide also defines much of the border between Alberta and British Columbia.
areas enjoy the mildest winter weather in all of Canada, as temperatures rarely fall much below the freezing mark.
has a dry continental climate with warm summers and cold winters.
province is open to cold Arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter.
contrast, summers can fluctuate from cool to hot and are generally wetter.
and Manitoba have a continental climate and experience extremes in weather.
Saskatchewan Party, also a conservative party, holds power in Saskatchewan and the NDP forms the government in Alberta.
a result, the government’s confidence and hold on power were shaken.
of the 104 western MPs in the Commons, 54 are Conservatives, 20 are New Democrats, and 29 are Liberals.
population of Ontario alone (13.1 million) exceeds that of all the Western provinces combined.
total population of Atlantic Canada, however, is 2.3 million, and this region is represented by 30 senators.
Ontario is under-represented, Quebec has representation proportional to its population and the Atlantic provinces are over-represented.
have advocated the so-called Triple-E Senate, which stands for "equal, elected, effective."
westerners find this approach simplistic and either advocate keeping the status quo or may support other models for senate reform.
population of Saskatchewan is only slightly larger than it was in 1931.
trend of net emigration in both provinces is reversing because of a lower cost of living than Alberta and B.C.
"BRCA" mutation is a mutation in either of the "BRCA1" and "BRCA2" genes, which are tumor suppressor genes.
mutations in these genes may produce a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome in affected persons.
risk of breast and ovarian cancer is higher for women with a high-risk "BRCA1" mutation than with a "BRCA2" mutation.
all mutations are high-risk; some appear to be harmless variations.
can be inherited from either parent and may be passed on to both sons and daughters.
risk of "BRCA"-related breast cancers for men with the mutation is higher than for other men, but still low.
"BRCA" mutations can increase the risk of other cancers, such as colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.
mutations in any of these genes disable the gene or the protein that it produces.
is because people with the mutation are likely to acquire a second mutation, leading to dominant expression of the cancer.
they are inherited from the parents, they are classified as "hereditary" or "germline mutations" rather than "acquired" or "somatic mutations".
caused by a mutated gene inherited from an individual's parents is a "hereditary cancer" rather than a "sporadic cancer".
humans have a diploid genome, each cell has two copies of the gene (one from each biological parent).
only one copy contains a disabling, inherited mutation, so the affected person is heterozygous for the mutation.
loss of the functional copy is called "loss of heterozygosity" (LOH).
resulting errors in DNA repair may result in cell death or a cancerous transformation of the cell.
are many variations in "BRCA" genes, and not all changes confer the same risks.
variants are harmless; others are known to be very harmful.
the person chooses to be tested, then two types of tests are available.
quickly results are returned depends on the test—single-site analysis requires less lab time—and on the infrastructure in place.
itself, a negative test result does not mean that the patient has no hereditary predisposition for breast or ovarian cancer.
family may have some other genetic predisposition for cancer, involving some other gene.
most cases of familial breast cancer, however, genetic predisposition remains elusive.
with deleterious mutations in either the "BRCA1" or "BRCA2" genes have a high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.
woman's ten-year risk for ovarian cancer is also increased by 6-12% under these conditions.
with a "BRCA" mutation have more than 100 times the normal rate of Fallopian tube cancer.
breast cancer appears at an earlier age than sporadic breast cancer.
ovarian and Fallopian tube cancer is more treatable than average because it is unusually susceptible to platinum-based chemotherapy like cisplatin.
those not surviving, 11% die from either breast or ovarian cancer, and 89% from other causes.
those women not surviving, 26% would die of breast cancer, 46% ovarian cancer, and 28% other causes.
those not surviving, 21% would die of breast cancer, 25% ovarian cancer and 54% other causes.
likelihood of surviving to at least age 70 can be improved by several medical interventions, notably prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy.
few men, with or without a predisposing mutation, develop breast cancer before age 50.
other men, men with a "BRCA" mutation, especially a "BRCA2" mutation, may benefit from professional and self breast exams.
variety of screening options and interventions are available to manage "BRCA"-related cancer risks.
typical recommendation includes frequent breast cancer screening as well as tests to detect ovarian cancer.
cancer screening usually involves ultrasonography of the pelvic region, typically twice a year.
blood test has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity for ovarian cancer.
contraceptives is associated with substantially lower risk of ovarian cancer in women with "BRCA" mutations.
is contraindicated for women who are most likely to be harmed by the common complications.
use can be combined with oophorectomy for even greater reduction of breast cancer risk, particularly in women with "BRCA2" mutations.
inhibitors are medications that prevent estrogen production in the adrenal glands and adipose tissue.
type of preventive surgeries are known to substantially reduce cancer risk for women with high-risk "BRCA" mutations.
and when to perform which preventive surgeries is a complex personal decision.
medical knowledge offers some guidance about the risks and benefits.
may choose to focus on total cancer prevention, psychological benefits, current quality of life, or overall survival.
decision is individualized and is usually based on many factors, such as earliest occurrence of "BRCA"-related cancer in close relatives.
this reason, oophorectomy is mostly recommended after age 35 or 40, assuming childbearing is complete.
comparison, women in the general population have an 84% chance of living to age 70.
mastectomy is the removal of both breasts by a breast surgeon.
techniques for reconstruction have been used, with different locations and amounts of scarring.
use breast implants, possibly preceded by tissue expanders, to provide volume.
some women have tattoos added to simulate breast areolas or have the skin reshaped to form a nipple.
related ovarian cancer tends to present in perimenopausal or menopausal women, so salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended between ages 45 and 50.
services can be used to preserve her eggs, if wanted.
side effects range from mild to severe; most can be treated at least partially.
the high risks and the low benefit of lifestyle choices in "BRCA" mutation carriers, no lifestyle choices provide sufficient protection.
of the pancreas tends to run in families, even among "BRCA" families.
4% and 7% of people with pancreatic cancer have a "BRCA" mutation.
since pancreatic cancer is relatively rare, people with a "BRCA2" mutation probably face an absolute risk of about 5%.
ovarian cancer, it tends not to produce symptoms in the early, treatable stages.
prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer associated with a "BRCA" mutation tends to appear about a decade earlier than non-hereditary cases.
screening is invasive and may be recommended only to "BRCA2" carriers who also have a family history of pancreatic cancer.
is the most deadly skin cancer, although it is easily cured in the early stages.
in "BRCA1" and "BRCA2" are strongly implicated in some hematological malignancies.
mutations are associated acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia.
of "BRCA2" are also found in many T-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemias.
younger the woman is at the time of her first birth, the more protection against breast cancer she receives.
some studies have produced different results, women with "BRCA" mutations are generally not expected to receive these significant protective benefits.
hypotheses propose that "BRCA" mutations might have evolutionary advantages, such as higher intelligence.

McAuliffe argued that improving transportation would spur job creation, and he wanted to reform the Standards of Learning and Medicaid.
Cuccinelli focused on tax cuts as well as expanding opportunities for veterans and growing Virginia's ports.
Sarvis was not invited to the event, but a spokesman provided a statement about the libertarian candidate.
sharpest exchange was between McAuliffe and the forum moderator Derek McGinty, an anchor on WUSA.
days after moderating the Battleground Forum, WUSA-TV news anchor Derek McGinty said Sarvis should be part of the conversation.

Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce and NBC4 hosted a debate between Cuccinelli and McAuliffe on September 25, 2013.
the debate, both McAuliffe and Cuccinelli attacked their opponent's records and views.

the announced threshold for inclusion in the debate was ten percent in the polls.
of Cuccinelli's funds in the first quarter of 2013 came from donors outside Virginia.
the second quarter of 2013, McAuliffe raised $2.2 million, Cuccinelli raised $1.1 million, and Sarvis raised approximately $2,500.
July 1, 2013 through August 31, 2013, McAuliffe raised $7,355,246; and Cuccinelli raised $5,688,222.
biggest donations included several energy companies and private individuals; his largest contribution over the period was $30,000.
of August 31, 2013, McAuliffe's campaign has $5,010,223 cash on hand, and Cuccinelli's campaign has $2,234,369 cash on hand.
PAC, a Libertarian-leaning super PAC, spent over $300,000 in television ads designed to boost the Sarvis campaign before election day.
polling for the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General elections, which did not feature a third-party candidate, was much more accurate.
polls showed that, contrary to conventional wisdom, Sarvis pulled far more votes from McAuliffe than Cuccinelli.
to conventional wisdom, globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world.

Local History Centre, which is located in Finsbury Library, was opened in 2003.
boroughs were merged in 1965 to form the modern London Borough of Islington.
collections were previously held at Islington's Central Reference Library and in smaller premises at Finsbury Library.
available at the Local History Centre include maps, photographs, census records, electoral rolls, trade directories, newspapers and archive material.
electoral rolls carry photographs of every individual voter, as does each voter’s identity card.
collections are useful sources for research on family history, local history, biographical history and other subjects.
local authority material includes records related to local baths, such as Ironmonger Row Baths.
centre also holds deposited special collections, including the following material:
centre has a regular programme of small temporary exhibitions, including visiting displays and displays of material from its own collections.
centre also hosts occasional talks and contributes to the events programme at Islington Museum.
researchers wishing to view material are required to make an appointment to visit as space is limited.

Island Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-01) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station.
were awarded during the spring of 1950, and work was started shortly afterwards on construction.
station was located 2 miles west of the Anchorage International Airport, in Cook Inlet.
Island AFS also operated as a Manual Control Center (MCC) site.
the creation of NORAD in 1957, Fire Island AFS became one of four NORAD Control Centers in Alaska.
USAF shared its radars with the United States Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) for Nike missile-defense system (Anchorage Defense Area).
they fear the deployment of a missile-defense system exclusively targeting Turkey’s neighbors.

balanced growth theory is an economic theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959).
theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously.
will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.
was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy.
theory discusses how the poor size of the market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state.
has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity.
size of a market assumes primary importance in the study of what induces investment in a country.
to assert that inducement to invest is limited by the size of the market.
purchasing power" means that the real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high.
is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low.
from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.
size of the market determines the incentive to invest irrespective of the nature of the economy.
is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product.
entrepreneurs sometimes resort to heavy advertising as a means of attracting buyers for their products.
to Nurkse, expanding the size of the market is crucial to increasing the inducement to invest.
mentioned the following pertinent points about how the size of the market is determined:
problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels.
low level of real interest rates does not appear to be due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause "inflationary pressure".
argued against the notion that a large population implies a large market.
underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low.
a large part of the population subsists on low-productivity jobs.
consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent.
country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand.
contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small.
notion that transport costs and trade barriers hinder the expansion of the market is age-old.
specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities.
address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries.
suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries.
they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether.
logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall.
Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view.
Nurkse argues that such activities cannot succeed at the macro level to increase a country's aggregate demand level.
aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply, governments must increase public spending.
the global level, there can also be a shortage of aggregate demand on the tradable side.
stressed productivity as the "primary determinant of the size of the market".
increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy.
underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.
example, in most underdeveloped economies, the "technology" used to carry out agricultural activities is backward.
is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence.
points to the need to increase output per unit input and "output per head".
can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc.
positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income).
the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.
is of the opinion that Say's Law of markets operates in underdeveloped countries.
a large scale investment programme in a wide array of industries simultaneously is the answer.
were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power.
point Nurkse was trying to make was that USA was rich in resource endowment as well as labour force.
labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with.
situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.
example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse the resources of the underdeveloped country.
would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered.
from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption.
since such commodities face inelastic demand, the extent to which they will sell in the market is limited.
Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.
then can productivity increase and lead to increasing returns to scale and eventually create virtuous circles of growth.
believed that the subject of who "should" promote development does not concern economists.
Nurkse's balanced growth theory too has been criticised on a number of grounds.
main critic was Albert O. Hirschman, the pioneer of the strategy of unbalanced growth.
Singer asserted that the balanced growth theory is more applicable to cure an economy facing a cyclical downswing.
downswing is a feature of an advanced stage of sustained growth rather than of the vicious cycle of poverty.
in this situation, simultaneous investment in a large number of sectors is a well-suited policy.
various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome.
for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.
contention was Nurkse's approval of Say's Law, which theorises that there is no overproduction or glut in the economy.
according to Nurkse's critics, his assumption of Say's Law being operational in underdeveloped countries needs greater justification.
both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce complementary goods.
are substitute goods too, which are in competition with each other.
if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.
Singer suggested that Nurkse's theory makes dubious assumptions about the underdeveloped economy.
example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand.
the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy.
believed that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't in fact a theory of growth.
implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage.
entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity.
reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country.
will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns.
local population suffered greatly during this period, while the Axis Powers initiated a policy of large scale plunder.
6 April 1941, Germany attacked Greece and the Greek forces fell back quickly under the astonishing firepower of the Blitzkrieg.
general, the Axis powers viewed conquered nations as sources of raw materials, food and labor.
a matter of policy, subjugated nations were to provide material support to Germany and Italy.
pillage, torture, executions, and civilian massacres throughout Greece were also part of the Axis agenda during the years of occupation.
rose to extreme levels, while extraordinary levies were extorted from the Greek collaborationist government to sustain the occupying forces.
food price controls and rationing that had been in place before the Greek defeat were now tightened.
these circumstances, black market and rationing became the only means of food supply in the urban areas of Greece.
was also prohibited, at least during the early period of occupation.
mid-September 1941, when the famine was imminent, Berlin responded to enquiries of German officials in Greece:
few organized efforts by the Orthodox Church and Red Cross were unable to meet the needs of the population.
Syria, 80% of the population is unable to meet its basic needs.
factors were the attempt of the local government and the occupying forces to regulate the market and its prices.
nutritional situation became critical in the summer of 1941 and in the fall turned into a full-blown famine.
of dead persons were secretly abandoned in cemeteries or at the streets.
other cases bodies were found days after the death had taken place.
sight of emaciated dead bodies was commonplace in the streets of Athens.
are no accurate numbers of the famine deaths because civil registration records did not function during the occupation.
not all parts of Greece experienced equal levels of food scarcity.
first ship with food supplies that was permitted to reach Greece was the SS "Kurtuluş" from Turkey, at September 1941.
assistance remained symbolic since one ship was unable to alleviate such an extreme situation.
increasing public pressure finally led to the lifting of the naval blockade in February 1942.
shipments soon began and together with the rising temperatures of springtime, resulted in the reduction of the mortality rates.
Athens the Red Cross started to provide daily milk rations, medical services and clothing to children younger than two years.
order to deal with this situation, Hermann Neubacher, was appointed Reich's special commissioner in Greece.
objective was to sustain Axis operation in Greece without destroying the Greek economy.
initiative was eased by the supplies provided by the International Red Cross.
conditions appeared again during the winter of 1943–44 in Aetolia and some islands.
various works mention the severe situation faced by the Greek population during the years of occupation.
of these is the novel "Zorba the Greek", by Nikos Kazantzakis, which reflected the general
Civol (also Anyam Siwol or Civol is a small town in the north-east of Senegal about 70 km north-west from Matam.
is in the historical region of Fouta-Toro in the department and region of Matam.
town is located on Highway N2 some 300 km east of Saint Louis.
is some 5 km south of the border with Mauretania, which generally follows the course of the Senegal River.
the south are the fields of Diéri, a cropping area for Millet, Sorghum, and cowpeas.
population of Agnam Civol lives on agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, trade, and remittances from emigres in other countries.

relief of the rural community is rugged with three ecological zones running north to south from the Senegal River.
the Waalo area there are three types of soil: the Hollalde, Faalo, and Fonde.
Hollalde is characterised by a flat typography and with soil of 60% clay.
Faalo is flat with sandy textured soil along flooded riverbanks.
Fonde has less than 40% clay in the soil and is less productive as it is flooded less frequently.

"Ka", the first settlers'priests, assumed the role of village chief.
population of Civol was at first living at Kadiel-Baytillaye, a hill south of the present village for over 365 years.
" comes from"ar gnam " in Fulani which means"come and eat".
area is known as a regional trading post and is very welcoming.
name of "Agnam" that precedes a dozen village names in the region was given by foreigners staying there.
oldest man of the founding family, the Ka, was appointed Village Chief.
nearly 300 years, the Village Chief was elected democratically by the people, but always from the Ka.
Cissé Kâ was the first to bear the title of Village Chief.
name is preceded by the title "Thierno Civol" (Village Chief Civol).
then, 28 Village Chiefs followed, including the current Thierno Civol "Abdoul Samba Ka".
Civol" was set up as a rural community (communauté rurale) in 1972 by bringing together more than twenty villages.
these villages had formed a traditional community under the name "Agnam" that almost all of these villages share.
population is very young (60% under 20 years and 32% between 20 and 54 years).
a few traders have established in the commercial sectors, mainly in building or clothing.
main economic activities are agriculture, livestock, fishing and small business.
activity and business profits would have been lower, and government deficits would have been higher.

Civol has had a Koranic Arabic school for nearly five centuries.
Aziz Kane" was one of the founders of the cooperation agreement between Vouziers and Civol.
has been the president of the rural council of Agnam-Civol for more than 10 years.

of property are usually divided into topsoil (田皮) and subsoil (田骨) rights.
landlords in turn collected rent from peasants who used the land for agricultural purposes (topsoil rights).
are still on-going debates as to whether Imperial China had actual private property rights.
such times, there were frequent shifts in ownership as abandoned land was reclaimed after former owners had fled or died.
the areas controlled by Communist forces traditional land tenure was broken up through Land Reform.
directly after the Second World War, Land Reform took a more radical turn.
was not until a speech by Mao in 1948 that a moderate stance was taken once more.
were several times of changes in ownership and control over land in China.
rural land, these changes began with the establishment of the Higher Agricultural Production Cooperatives in 1956.
Land Reform (1950-1952) was one of the largest examples of land expropriation in world history.
the process, between 200–240 million acres of arable land were redistributed to approximately 75 million peasant families.
Great Leap Forward (1958–1962) forced the central leadership to decentralize land ownership from the commune to the production team.
on the region, farming was more or less privatized, with managerial responsibilities vested in the household.
households negotiated contracts under which they had to deliver grain quota to the state at low fixed prices.
surplus grain above the quota could be sold freely at private markets.
privileges were rescinded twice (and subsequently reinstalled) during the Great Leap Forward and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–76).
13 of the constitution provided that:"The lawful private property of citizens shall be inviolable.
country shall protect in accordance with law citizens'private property rights and inheritance rights.
American law in accordance with the rights guaranteed by the US Constitution;
country may, as necessitated by public interest, expropriate or requisition citizens'private property and pay compensation therefor."
can thus be seen that China's property laws have been undergoing developments.
property rights in China can generally be grouped into three types.
second type is usufructuary rights, and the third is security rights.
this right has to comply with laws and social morality.
can harm neither public interests nor the legitimate rights and interests of others.
general, rural collectives own agricultural land and the state owns urban land.
obligee may not intervene in the exercise of rights by the owner of the usufructuary right.
right to land contractual management allows a contractor of the right to possess, utilize and obtain profits from agricultural land.
right is transferable, but the land use rights based on agricultural household contracts cannot be changed arbitrarily for non-agricultural purposes.
is in addition to being able to possess, utilize and obtain profits from the land.
right may be established by means of assignment or transfer, but transfer is limited.
ownership of the buildings will change together with the land.
owner of easement has the right to use the real property of others to benefit his own real property.
of security rights have priority if a debtor defaults on his obligation.
rights do not exist independently, but require a valid principal claim, and lapse when the debt lapses.
land in China belongs to the state and the collectives.
land user obtains only the land use right, not the land or any resources in or below the land.
use rights can be obtained from the land administration department by agreement, tender or auction.
interests in land must be recorded in the official government register.
Property Law only offers a general guideline as to recordation.
Ho has described the recordation of Chinese property rights per institution as it exists until 2014.
6 provides for a general registration requirement in the cases of creation, modification, transfer, and elimination of rights to immovables.
description below applies to the post-reform legal arrangements and should not be confused with nationalistation of property before 1978.
Chinese authorities are empowered under the Constitution and various statutes
expropriate land use rights contracted to individuals as well as ownership rights from collectives..
all land is owned either collectively or by the state,
of rural land only requires the withdrawal of land use rights for the reason of "public interest."
include interests such as defence, transportation infrastructure, education and health.
the first two are paid to the collective landowners instead of the farmers.
the farmers and collective land owners are notified, the expropriation can commence.
regarding the compensation and resettlement shall not affect the implementation of the expropriation.
Land Administrative Law provides five situations under which land use rights may be withdrawn:
rights holder is entitled to "appropriate compensation" in the first two situations.
the state owns the land, compensation is not made for the loss of the rights holder's land use rights,
local government or non-profit organisations are now in charge of land expropriation and compensation.
minimising the business interests in the expropriation procedure, incidents of forced expropriation might be reduced.
a rights holder wants to protect his property, he can evoke certain procedural safeguards, which include:
January 2011,a 54-year-old man was beaten to death for refusing to leave his house that was expropriated for demolition.
having implemented the household production responsibility system, China retains collectively-owned farmland in the rural areas.
Ho has demonstrated that one of the unresolved issues is the level of collective ownership.
law does not stipulate whether the former production team is still the legal owner.
local culture, the fear of authority and the possibility of violent repercussions hinder a victim's inclination to seek legal recourse.
such rules may be disregarded by the committees or councils due to lack of enforcement.
critics may be skeptical of whether the new enactments clarifying the issue of collective ownership will
a difference, such changes are still welcomed as signs of increasing protection for the rural villagers.
issue is the problem of rampant corruption arising from rural land transactions, involving both governmental and non-governmental parties.
leads to over-pricing and also improper use of land that goes unchecked.

such is a difficult state of affairs to arrive at, given the largely
a warm water fish, is one of the more suitable candidates for offshore aquaculture.
are large pelagic fish, up to 2 metres (78 inches) long and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) in weight.
are solitary fish except when spawning, found in warm-temperate to tropical waters.
Taiwan cobia weighing 100–600 grams are cultured for 1–1.5 years to reach the 6–8 kilograms needed for export to Japan.
around 80% of marine cages in Taiwan are devoted to cobia culture.
2004, the FAO reported that 80.6% of the world’s cobia production was by China and Taiwan.
possibility is also being examined of growing hatchery reared cobia in offshore cages around Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
depths, stronger currents, and distance from shore all act to reduce the environmental impacts often associated with fin fish aquaculture.
direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods.
cage systems could become some of the most environmentally sustainable methods for commercial marine fish aquaculture.
some problems still exist in cobia culture that needs to be addressed and solved for increasing production.
include high mortality rates due to stress during transport from nursery tanks or inshore cages out to grow-out cages.
diseases in the nursery stage and the grow-out culture can result in low survival rates and a poor harvest.
fish are transferred into onboard-tanks on a transport vessel for transport to hatchery facilities.
are anesthetized with clove oil if necessary to reduce stress during transportation.
technology can also reduce stress on the transportation system.
are also treated for ectoparasites on their gills and skin that could proliferate later after transfer to maturation tanks.
tanks are often stocked with cleaner fish, "Gobiosoma oceanops", as a biological control for any remaining ectoparasites.
broodstock diet includes sardines, squid and formulated feeds, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements.
eggs are collected with a surface skimmer using mesh screen bags.
eggs are transferred to incubation tanks where they are disinfected for an hour with 100 ppm formalin.
larvae require rotifers for at least four days after hatching.
addition, juveniles exposed to varying salinities exhibited sustained growth and improved health at higher salinities, 15 and 30 ppt.
15–25 days post hatching, cobia are weaned onto commercial formulated feeds.
cobia larvae at salinities as low as 15 ppt is possible.
weaned fingerlings weighing up to one gram are transferred to juvenile culture tanks.
cobia juveniles can be raised in ponds or shallow, near-shore submerged cages.
thrive on a wide range of protein and lipid, but there are optimal levels where they get the most benefit.
an 8-week growth trial, juvenile cobia displayed a peak in their weight gain with a dietary protein concentration of 44.5%.
gain is also likely to increase as the lipid content in the diet increases.
levels exceeding 15–18% produces little practical benefit because of higher fat accretion in the cobia.
has low feed conversion rates, yielding 1 kilogram of fish biomass for 1.8 kilograms of pellets which contain 50% fishmeal.
cobia are then transferred to open ocean cages for final the grow-out when they reach 6–10 kilograms.
better growth rates were experienced in offshore cage farms in Taiwan.
addition, cobia are considered to be gonochoristic, with differential growth rates occurring between sexes.
grow faster and have been shown to be significantly longer and heavier within year classes.
such operations require more developed infrastructure than near-shore aquaculture systems, which makes them expensive.
units are used as memory backup for static random-access memory (SRAM).
do not use the conventional solid dielectric of ordinary capacitors.
use electrostatic double-layer capacitance or electrochemical pseudocapacitance or a combination of both instead:

of the double layer and pseudocapacitance models (see Double layer (interfacial)).
charcoal is an electrical conductor that is an extremely porous "spongy" form of carbon with a high specific surface area.
1957 H. Becker developed a "Low voltage electrolytic capacitor with porous carbon electrodes".
nature of electrochemical energy storage was not described in this patent.
in 1970, the electrochemical capacitor patented by Donald L. Boos was registered as an electrolytic capacitor with activated carbon electrodes.
basic mechanical design remains the basis of most electrochemical capacitors.
1975 and 1980 Brian Evans Conway conducted extensive fundamental and development work on ruthenium oxide electrochemical capacitors.
1991 he described the difference between "Supercapacitor" and "Battery" behavior in electrochemical energy storage.
working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, intercalation and electrosorption (adsorption onto a surface).
his research, Conway greatly expanded the knowledge of electrochemical capacitors.
product became a successful energy source for memory backup applications.
generation EDLC's had relatively high internal resistance that limited the discharge current.
were used for low current applications such as powering SRAM chips or for data backup.
the end of the 1980s, improved electrode materials increased capacitance values.
the same time, the development of electrolytes with better conductivity lowered the equivalent series resistance (ESR) increasing charge/discharge currents.
1992, Maxwell Laboratories (later Maxwell Technologies) took over this development.
adopted the term Ultracapacitor from PRI and called them "Boost Caps" to underline their use for power applications.
1994 using the anode of a 200V high voltage tantalum electrolytic capacitor, David A. Evans developed an "Electrolytic-Hybrid Electrochemical Capacitor".
combine an electrostatic carbon electrode with a pre-doped lithium-ion electrochemical electrode.
the pre-doping process lowers the anode potential and results in a high cell output voltage, further increasing specific energy.
capacitors (supercapacitors) consist of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes.
two electrodes form a series circuit of two individual capacitors "C" and "C".
electrochemical capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically separated by a separator, which are ionically connected to each other via the electrolyte.
electrolyte is a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a solvent such as water.
this interface occurs a very special phenomenon of the double layer effect.
a voltage to an electrochemical capacitor causes both electrodes in the capacitor to generate electrical double-layers.
amount of charge in the electrode is matched by the magnitude of counter-charges in outer Helmholtz plane (OHP).
double-layer phenomena store electrical charges as in a conventional capacitor.
double-layer serves approximately as the dielectric layer in a conventional capacitor, albeit with the thickness of a single molecule.
the standard formula for conventional plate capacitors can be used to calculate their capacitance:
further increase of density of capacitance in SCs can be connected with increasing of quantum capacitance of carbon electrode nanostructures.
amount of charge stored per unit voltage in an electrochemical capacitor is primarily a function of the electrode size.
no chemical changes take place within the electrode or electrolyte, charging and discharging electric double-layers in principle is unlimited.
can originate when specifically adsorbed ions out of the electrolyte pervade the double-layer.
faradaic charge transfer originates by a very fast sequence of reversible redox, intercalation or electrosorption processes.
electrons involved in the faradaic processes are transferred to or from valence electron states (orbitals) of the redox electrode reagent.
such, the storage capacity of faradaic pseudocapacitance is limited by the finite quantity of reagent in the available surface.
amount of electric charge stored in a pseudocapacitance is linearly proportional to the applied voltage.
charged, the energy is stored in a static electric field that permeates the dielectric between the electrodes.
maximum potential difference between the plates (the maximal voltage) is limited by the dielectric's breakdown field strength.
contrast, electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) consists of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and electrically connected via an electrolyte.
storage occurs within the double-layers of both electrodes as a mixture of a double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance.
asymmetrical supercapacitors like hybrid capacitors the voltage drop between the electrodes could be asymmetrically.
maximum potential across the capacitor (the maximal voltage) is limited by the electrolyte decomposition voltage.
electrostatic and electrochemical energy storage in supercapacitors are linear with respect to the stored charge, just as in conventional capacitors.
voltage between the capacitor terminals is linear with respect to the amount of stored energy.
they cover a broad range of capacitance values the size of the cases can vary.
to the electrode material is its very large surface area.
electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits.
the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type.
the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.
properties of supercapacitors come from the interaction of their internal materials.
the combination of electrode material and type of electrolyte determine the functionality and thermal and electrical characteristics of the capacitors.
electrodes are generally thin coatings applied and electrically connected to a conductive, metallic current collector.
supercapacitor electrodes are typically made of porous, spongy material with an extraordinarily high specific surface area, such as activated carbon.
the ability of the electrode material to perform faradaic charge transfers enhances the total capacitance.
the smaller the electrode's pores, the greater the capacitance and specific energy.
smaller pores increase equivalent series resistance (ESR) and decrease specific power.
with high peak currents require larger pores and low internal losses, while applications requiring high specific energy need small pores.
sizes in carbons typically range from micropores (less than 2 nm) to mesopores (2-50 nm), but only micropores (<2 nm) contribute to pseudocapacitance.
carbon (AC) was the first material chosen for EDLC electrodes.
though its electrical conductivity is approximately 0.003% that of metals (1,250 to 2,000 S/m), it is sufficient for supercapacitors.
bulk form used in electrodes is low-density with many pores, giving high double-layer capacitance.
carbon fibres (ACF) are produced from activated carbon and have a typical diameter of 10 µm.
can have micropores with a very narrow pore-size distribution that can be readily controlled.
of AFC electrodes include low electrical resistance along the fibre axis and good contact to the collector.
for activated carbon, AFC electrodes exhibit predominantly double-layer capacitance with a small amount of pseudocapacitance due to their micropores.
electrodes are made via pyrolysis of resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels and are more conductive than most activated carbons.
electrodes also provide mechanical and vibration stability for supercapacitors used in high-vibration environments.
electrodes that incorporate composite material can add a high amount of pseudocapacitance.
electrodes with tailored pore design offer as much as 75% greater specific energy than conventional activated carbons.
is a one-atom thick sheet of graphite, with atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern, also called "nanocomposite paper".
has a theoretical specific surface area of 2630 m/g which can theoretically lead to a capacitance of 550 F/g.
addition, an advantage of graphene over activated carbon is its higher electrical conductivity.
capacitors may be suitable for 100/120 Hz filter applications, which are unreachable for supercapacitors using other carbon materials.
nanotubes (CNTs), also called buckytubes, are carbon molecules with a cylindrical nanostructure.
have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphene.
are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).
latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian matryoshka dolls.
have thicker coaxial walls, separated by spacing (0.34 nm) that is close to graphene's interlayer distance.
can grow vertically on the collector substrate, such as a silicon wafer.
nanotubes can greatly improve capacitor performance, due to the highly wettable surface area and high conductivity.
SWCNTs-based supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte was systematically studied at University of Delaware in Prof. Bingqing Wei's group.
CNTs have higher capacitance than activated carbon electrodes, e.g., 102 F/g for MWNTs and 180 F/g for SWNTs.
have mesopores that allow for easy access of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface.
the considerable volume change during repeated intercalation and depletion decreases their mechanical stability.
this end, research to increase surface area, mechanical strength, electrical conductivity and chemical stability is ongoing.
the charge storage originates from electron-transfer mechanisms rather than accumulation of ions in the electrochemical double layer.
were created through faradaic redox reactions that occur within the active electrode materials.
the charge storage mechanisms of transition-metal oxides are based predominantly on pseudocapacitance.
second mechanism is based on the surface adsorption of electrolyte cations on MnO.
E. Conway's research described electrodes of transition metal oxides that exhibited high amounts of pseudocapacitance.
takes place over a window of about 1.2 V per electrode.
pseudocapacitance of about 720 F/g is roughly 100 times higher than for double-layer capacitance using activated carbon electrodes.
transition metal electrodes offer excellent reversibility, with several hundred-thousand cycles.
ruthenium is expensive and the 2.4 V voltage window for this capacitor limits their applications to military and space applications.
device was a three-dimensional (3D) sub-5 nm hydrous ruthenium-anchored graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid foam (RGM) architecture.
mechanically weak, conductive polymers have high conductivity, resulting in a low ESR and a relatively high capacitance.
electrodes also employ electrochemical doping or dedoping of the polymers with anions and cations.
made from or coated with conductive polymers are cost comparable to carbon electrodes.
polyacene electrodes provide up to 10,000 cycles, much better than batteries.
combine an electrode with high amount of pseudocapacitance with an electrode with a high amount of double-layer capacitance.
electrodes achieve higher capacitances than either pure carbon or pure metal oxide or polymer-based electrodes.
way to enhance CNT electrodes is by doping with a pseudocapacitive dopant as in lithium-ion capacitors.
this case the relatively small lithium atoms intercalate between the layers of carbon.
anode is made of lithium-doped carbon, which enables lower negative potential with a cathode made of activated carbon.
results in a larger voltage of 3.8-4 V that prevents electrolyte oxidation.
battery electrodes influenced the development of electrodes for new hybrid-type supercapacitor electrodes as for lithium-ion capacitors.
advantage of this type of supercapacitors is their higher voltage and correspondingly their higher specific energy (up to 10-20 Wh/kg (36-72 kJ/kg)).
far as known no commercial offered supercapacitors with such kind of asymmetric electrodes are on the market.
consist of a solvent and dissolved chemicals that dissociate into positive cations and negative anions, making the electrolyte electrically conductive.
supercapacitors electrolytes are the electrically conductive connection between the two electrodes.
electrolyte determines the capacitor's characteristics: its operating voltage, temperature range, ESR and capacitance.
the same activated carbon electrode an aqueous electrolyte achieves capacitance values of 160 F/g, while an organic electrolyte achieves only 100 F/g.
electrolyte's viscosity must be low enough to wet the porous, sponge-like structure of the electrodes.
ideal electrolyte does not exist, forcing a compromise between performance and other requirements.
electrolytes have a dissociation voltage of 1.15 V per electrode (2.3 V capacitor voltage) and a relatively low operating temperature range.
are used in supercapacitors with low specific energy and high specific power.
have to physically separate the two electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact.
separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity.
sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.
collector is either sprayed onto the electrode or is a metal foil.
must be able to distribute peak currents of up to 100 A.
values for commercial capacitors are specified as "rated capacitance C".
is the value for which the capacitor has been designed.
value for an actual component must be within the limits given by the specified tolerance.
values are in the range of farads (F), three to six orders of magnitude larger than those of electrolytic capacitors.
capacitance value results from the energy W of a loaded capacitor loaded via a DC voltage V.
AC capacitance measurement offers fast results, important for industrial production lines.
extraordinary strong frequency dependence can be explained by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores.
area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions.
greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance.
phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants.
the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.
the capacitor has to be discharged with a constant discharge current I.
value of the discharge current is determined by the application.
measurement methods employed by individual manufacturers are mainly comparable to the standardized methods.
standardized measuring method is too time consuming for manufacturers to use during production for each individual component.
charge and discharge cycles mean that neither the rated capacitance value nor specific energy are available.
this case the rated capacitance value is recalculated for each application condition.
should never be subjected to voltages continuously in excess of the rated voltage.
rated voltage includes a safety margin against the electrolyte's breakdown voltage at which the electrolyte decomposes.
breakdown voltage decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. water splits into hydrogen and oxide.
solvent molecules then cannot separate the electrical charges from each other.
voltages than rated voltage cause hydrogen gas formation or a short circuit.
supercapacitors below the rated voltage improves the long-time behavior of the electrical parameters.
values and internal resistance during cycling are more stable and lifetime and charge/discharge cycles may be extended.
balancing may include electronic voltage management above a threshold that varies the current.
occur during this movement that can be measured as the internal DC resistance.
internal DC resistance is time dependent and increases during charge/discharge.
applications often only the switch-on and switch-off range is interesting.
discharge current I for the measurement of internal resistance can be taken from the classification according to IEC 62391-1.
is not relevant for calculating superconductor inrush currents or other peak currents.
limits the charge and discharge peak currents as well as charge/discharge times.
and the capacitance C results in the time constant formula_6
capacitors with constant internal resistance fully charge during about 5 τ.
internal resistance increases with charge/discharge, actual times cannot be calculated with this formula.
supercapacitors operate without forming chemical bonds, current loads, including charge, discharge and peak currents are not limited by reaction constraints.
load and cycle stability can be much higher than for rechargeable batteries.
loads are limited only by internal resistance, which may be substantially lower than for batteries.
resistance "R" and charge/discharge currents or peak currents "I" generate internal heat losses "P" according to:
heat must be released and distributed to the ambient environment to maintain operating temperatures below the specified maximum temperature.
that reason the specified charge and discharge currents for frequent cycling are determined by internal resistance.
specified cycle parameters under maximal conditions include charge and discharge current, pulse duration and frequency.
are specified for a defined temperature range and over the full voltage range for a defined lifetime.
can differ enormously depending on the combination of electrode porosity, pore size and electrolyte.
a lower current load increases capacitor life and increases the number of cycles.
can be achieved either by a lower voltage range or slower charging and discharging.
the higher current load is this the second great advantage of supercapacitors over batteries.
stability results from the dual electrostatic and electrochemical storage principles.
specified charge and discharge currents can be significantly exceeded by lowering the frequency or by single pulses.
occupy the gap between high power/low energy electrolytic capacitors and low power/high energy rechargeable batteries.
energy W that can be stored in a capacitor is given by the formula
formula describes the amount of energy stored and is often used to describe new research successes.
formula also represents the energy asymmetric voltage components such as lithium ion capacitors.
amount of energy that can be stored in a capacitor per mass of that capacitor is called its specific energy.
energy is measured gravimetrically (per unit of mass) in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg).
amount of energy can be stored in a capacitor per volume of that capacitor is called its energy density.
density is measured volumetrically (per unit of volume) in watt-hours per litre (Wh/l).
comparison, petrol fuel has an energy density of 32.4 MJ/l.
the specific energy of supercapacitors is insufficient compared with batteries, capacitors have the important advantage of the specific power.
power describes the speed at which energy can be delivered to/absorbed from the load.
V = voltage applied and R, the internal DC resistance of the capacitor.
described maximum power P specifies the power of a theoretical rectangular single maximum current peak of a given voltage.
real circuits the current peak is not rectangular and the voltage is smaller, caused by the voltage drop.
62391–2 established a more realistic effective power P for supercapacitors for power applications:
specific power is typically 10 to 100 times greater than for batteries and can reach values up to 15 kW/kg.
charts relate energy to power and are a valuable tool for characterizing and visualizing energy storage components.
evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current load, current cycle frequency and voltage.
load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat.
temperature is measurable as core temperature in the center of a capacitor body.
higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.
large changes of electrical parameters specified in IEC/EN 62391-2 are usually unacceptable for high current load applications.
that support high current loads use much smaller limits, e.g., 20% loss of capacitance or double the internal resistance.
they specify the expected capacitor lifetime at the maximum temperature and voltage conditions.
results are specified in datasheets using the notation"tested time (hours)/max.
this value and expressions derived from historical data, lifetimes can be estimated for lower temperature conditions.
a "zero defect" product policy during this test no wear out or total failure may occur.
lifetime specification from datasheets can be used to estimate the expected lifetime for a given design.
"10-degrees-rule" used for electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte is used in those estimations and can be used for supercapacitors.
rule employs the Arrhenius equation, a simple formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates.
every 10 °C reduction in operating temperature, the estimated life doubles.
with this formula, capacitors specified with 5000 h at 65 °C, have an estimated lifetime of 20,000 h at 45 °C.
are also dependent on the operating voltage, because the development of gas in the liquid electrolyte depends on the voltage.
lower the voltage the smaller the gas development and the longer the lifetime.
voltage dependent curves shown from the picture are an empirical result from one manufacturer.
expectancy for power applications may be also limited by current load or number of cycles.
limitation has to be specified by the relevant manufacturer and is strongly type dependent.
this short distance irregularities can occur, leading to a small exchange of charge carriers and gradual discharge.

support, Joseph I persuaded Eugene to return to Italy and restore Habsburg honour.
elsewhere were now to have major consequences for the war in Italy.
success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control.
Imperial victory in Italy marked the beginning of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of Milan.
the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole.
French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707 the Imperial army began its retirement.
Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre.
Eugene and I, " wrote the Duke,"shall never differ about our share of the laurels."
now favoured a bold advance along the coast to bypass the major French fortresses, followed by a march on Paris.
fearful of unprotected supply-lines, the Dutch and Eugene favoured a more cautious approach.
acquiesced and resolved upon the siege of Vauban's great fortress, Lille.
French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands.
who has not seen this, " wrote Eugene,"has seen nothing."
recent defeats, together with the severe winter of 1708–09, had caused extreme famine and privation in France.
the collapse of the negotiations, and aware of the vagaries of war, Eugene wrote to the Emperor in mid-June 1709.
can be no doubt that the next battle will be the biggest and bloodiest that has yet been fought."
the fall of Tournai on 3 September (itself a major undertaking), the Allied generals turned their attention towards Mons.
Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west of the town and began to fortify his position.
the difficulties of the attack, however, the Allied generals did not shrink from their original determination.
subsequent Battle of Malplaquet, fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war.
sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to breakthrough and claim victory.
August 1709 Eugene's chief political opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain.
and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at the breakdown of the talks.
was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai.
the death of Joseph I on 17 April 1711 his brother, Charles, the pretender to the Spanish throne, became emperor.
however, the Austrians had made some progress– the Hungarian revolt had finally came to end.
to influence public opinion in England and force the French into making substantial concessions, Eugene prepared for a major campaign.
the forces of public opinion on which democracies rest rarely take shape in ideal conditions.
the death in December of his friend and close political ally, Count Wratislaw, Eugene became undisputed'first minister'in Vienna.
this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles VI towards peace.
Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor.
with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent.
successful feints and stratagems Landau fell to the French commander in August, followed in November by Freiburg.
Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles VI was compelled to enter into negotiations.
and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November.
main reason for desiring peace in the west was the growing danger posed by the Turks in the east.
Vienna it was clear that the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699.
left Vienna in early June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000–90,000 men.
Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so.
at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and Sava, Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Mustapha Pasha.
spread through Europe of Eugene's imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege.
victory was the crowning point of Eugene's military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general.
ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the Prince at his best.
war had dispelled the immediate Turkish threat to Hungary, and was a triumph for the Empire and for Eugene personally.
the Spanish fleet's destruction off Cape Passaro, Philip V and Elisabeth remained resolute, and rejected the treaty.
of Eugene's former favourites, General Bonneval, also joined the nobles in opposition to de Prié, further undermining the Prince.
de Prié's position became untenable Eugene felt compelled to resign his post as governor on 16 November 1724.
in a surprise move Spain and Austria moved closer with the signing of the Treaty of Vienna in April/May 1725.
the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc.
the conclusion of the brief Anglo-Spanish conflict, war between the European powers persisted throughout 1727–28.
Eugene it was'an event that which is seldom to be found in history'.
the beginning of 1730 Eugene, who had remained bellicose throughout the whole period, was again in control of Austrian policy.
Britain there now emerged a new political re-alignment as the Anglo-French "entente" became increasingly defunct.
Emperor also intended Maria Theresa to marry Francis Stephen of Lorraine which would present an unacceptable threat on France's border.
the beginning of 1733 the French army was ready for war: all that was needed was the excuse.
1733 the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, Augustus the Strong, died.
Polish succession had afforded Louis XV's chief minister, Fleury, the opportunity to attack Austria and take Lorraine from Francis Stephen.
order to gain Spanish support France backed the succession of Elisabeth Farnese's sons to further Italian lands.
danger to the monarchy, " wrote Eugene to the Emperor in October,"cannot be exaggerated".
the end of the year Franco-Spanish forces had seized Lorraine and Milan; by early 1734 Spanish troops had taken Sicily.
took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he was forced onto the defensive.
June Eugene set out to relieve Philippsburg, yet his former drive and energy was now gone.
Eugene was a young Frederick the Great, sent by his father to learn the art of war.
and Eleonora were constant companions, meeting for dinner, receptions and card games almost every day till his death.
their surviving correspondence does not indicate any real intimacy in the relationship.
other friends such as the papal nuncio, Passionei, made up for the family he still lacked.
the death of Emmanuel's son in 1734, no close male relatives remained to succeed the Prince.
playing cards at Countess Batthyány's on the evening of 20 April he returned to his bed at the Stadtpalais.
heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin.
remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the body was interred in the "Kreuzkapelle".
Batthyány expressed in a letter dated 23 December 1720, that at the "Kreuzkapelle" a solemn requiem would be held annually.
spent most of his life in Vienna at his Winter Palace, the Stadtpalais, built by Fischer von Erlach.
more importance was the grandiose complex of the two Belvedere palaces in Vienna.
single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716.
spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties.
the years following the Peace of Rastatt Eugene became acquainted with a large number of scholarly men.
also befriended the French writer Jean-Baptiste Rousseau who, by 1716, was receiving financial support from Eugene.
stayed on attached to the Prince's household, probably helping in the library, until he left for the Netherlands in 1722.
library, prints and drawings were purchased by the Emperor in 1737 and have since passed into Austrian national collections.
considered Eugene one of the seven greatest commanders of history.
later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general.
was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work.
fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks.
the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations.
the whole his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them.
his position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful.
the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force.
him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends."
historian Christopher Duffy it was this awareness of the'grand strategy'that was Eugene's legacy to Frederick.
the contrast to his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war were stark.
result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection.
huge equestrian statue in the centre of Vienna commemorates Eugene's achievements.
value management is a project management technique for measuring project performance and progress.
has the ability to combine measurements of the project management triangle:
recent research studies have shown that the principles of EVM are positive predictors of project success.
in recent years has shown how important and ingrained notions of fairness are.
the most basic requirement of an EVM system is that it quantifies progress using PV and EV.
A has been approved for a duration of 1 year and with the budget of X.
was also planned that the project spends 50% of the approved budget in the first 6 months.
in reality the provided information is not sufficient to come to such a conclusion.
management research investigating the contribution of EVM to project success suggests a moderately strong positive relationship.
of EVM can be scaled to fit projects of all sizes and complexities.
1967, the DoD established a criterion-based approach, using a set of 35 criteria, called the Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC).
was often considered a financial control tool that could be delegated to analytical specialists.
1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney canceled the Navy A-12 Avenger II Program because of performance problems detected by EVM.
the 1990s, many U.S. Government regulations were eliminated or streamlined.
EVM not only survived the acquisition reform movement, but became strongly associated with the acquisition reform movement itself.
use of EVM expanded beyond the U.S. Department of Defense.
was adopted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, United States Department of Energy and other technology-related agencies.
industrialized nations also began to utilize EVM in their own procurement programs.
integration of EVM with the practice of project management accelerated in the 1990s.
also received greater attention by publicly traded companies in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Australia EVM has been codified as standards AS 4817-2003 and AS 4817-2006.
is helpful to see an example of project tracking that does not include earned value performance management.
a project that has been planned in detail, including a time-phased spend plan for all elements of work.
1 shows the cumulative budget (cost) for this project as a function of time (the blue line, labeled PV).
also shows the cumulative actual cost of the project (red line, labeled AC) through week 8.
what is missing from this chart is any understanding of how much work has been accomplished during the project.
method is needed to measure technical performance objectively and quantitatively, and that is what EVM accomplishes.
the same project, except this time the project plan includes pre-defined methods of quantifying the accomplishment of work.
value may be accumulated monthly, weekly, or as progress is made.
2 shows the EV curve (in green) along with the PV curve from Figure 1.
is complementary to critical path or critical chain schedule management.
3 shows the same EV curve (green) with the actual cost data from Figure 1 (in red).
is a much better conclusion than might be derived from Figure 1.
4 shows all three curves together– which is a typical EVM line chart.
"foundational principle" of EVM, mentioned above, does not depend on the size or complexity of the project.
the "implementations" of EVM can vary significantly depending on the circumstances.
lightweight implementations of EVM are achievable by any person who has basic spreadsheet skills.
fact, spreadsheet implementations are an excellent way to learn basic EVM skills.
either case, it is important that the WBS or list be comprehensive.
most detailed elements of a WBS hierarchy (or the items in a list) are called activities (or tasks).
"second step" is to assign a value, called planned value (PV), to each activity.
in very simple projects, each activity may be assigned a weighted“point value" which might not be a budget number.
"third step" is to define“earning rules” for each activity.
simplest method is to apply just one earning rule, such as the 0/100 rule, to all activities.
the 0/100 rule, no credit is earned for an element of work until it is finished.
initial three steps define the minimal amount of planning for simplified EVM.
"final step" is to execute the project according to the plan and measure progress.
activities are started or finished, EV is accumulated according to the earning rule.
many projects, schedule performance (completing the work on time) is equal in importance to technical performance.
example, some new product development projects place a high premium on finishing quickly.
second layer of EVM skill can be very helpful in managing the schedule performance of these“intermediate” projects.
project manager may employ a critical path or critical chain to build a project schedule model.
in the lightweight implementation, the project manager must define the work comprehensively, typically in a WBS hierarchy.
will construct a project schedule model that describes the precedence links between elements of work.
schedule model can then be used to develop the PV curve (or baseline), as shown in Figure 2.
EVM schedule measurements are not necessarily conclusive, they provide useful diagnostic information.
is also common practice to track labor hours in parallel with currency.
following EVM formulas are for schedule management, and do not require accumulation of actual cost (AC).
is important because it is common in small and intermediate size projects for true costs to be unknown or unavailable.
Schedule Variance (SV) measured through EVM method is indicative only.
actual critical path is ultimately the determining factor of every project's duration.
this way, the distorting aspect of float would be eliminated.
would be no benefit to performing a non-critical activity with lots of float until it is due in proper sequence.
an activity would not generate a negative schedule variance until it had used up its float.
this method, one way of gaming the schedule metrics would be eliminated.
of the year 2007, a draft of ANSI/EIA-748B, a revision to the original is available from ANSI.
EVM is used as trend burndown/burnup graphs to make forecasts of progress towards a completion date transparent.
up Agile EVM is similar to a simple implementation of EVM with the following preparation steps:
EVM is now all about executing the project and tracking the accumulated EV according to the simple earning rule.
Agile EVM has been evolving for many years the following practices are well-established:
EVM is based on transparency and therefore graphically used in various trend charts.
still be used in Agile EVM by expressing the input variables like EV, PV and AC as:
Agile EVM is used in a complex environment, any earned value is more likely to be on the CTP.
latest estimate for the number of fixed time intervals can be calculated in Agile EVM as:
of EVM note a number of issues with implementing it
and further limitations may be inherent to the concept itself.
another school of thought holds that all work can be planned, even if in weekly timeboxes or other short increments.
EVM in fast-changing work environments is, in fact, an area of project management research.
traditional EVM standards, non-discrete effort is called“level of effort" (LOE).
projects can be planned with a project network, but do not have access to true and timely actual cost data.
systems that feed the data required by earned value management are usually in silos rather than interfaced and integrated.
practice, the collection of true and timely actual cost data can be the most difficult aspect of EVM.
projects can benefit from EVM, as described for intermediate implementations, above, and Earned Schedule.
risk profiles anticipate opportunities that may be revealed and possibly be exploited as development and testing proceeds.
some parts of Christianity did not attend later councils, or attended but did not accept the results.
belonging to what became known as the Church of the East only participated in the first two councils.
of councils as ecumenical and authoritative varies between different Christian denominations.
over christological and other questions have led certain branches to reject some councils that others accept.
Church of the East (accused by others of adhering to Nestorianism) accepts as ecumenical only the first two councils.
all, the Roman Catholic Church recognises twenty-one councils as ecumenical.
and confessional Protestants accept either the first seven or the first four as ecumenical councils.
doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is infallible.
the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic churches uphold versions of this doctrine.
documents were circulated, speeches made and responded to, votes taken, and final documents published and distributed.
councils dealt not only with doctrinal but also with disciplinary matters, which were decided in "canons" ("laws").
emperor gave them legal status within the entire Roman Empire.
were held in the eastern part of the Roman Empire.
the twenty-one ecumenical councils recognised by the Roman Catholic Church, some gained recognition as ecumenical only later.
the Eastern First Council of Constantinople became ecumenical only when its decrees were accepted in the West also.
late as the 11th century, only seven councils were recognised as ecumenical in the Roman Catholic Church.
following is a list of further councils generally recognised as ecumenical by Roman Catholic theologians:
Orthodox catechisms teach that there are seven ecumenical councils and there are feast days for seven ecumenical councils.
Pan-Orthodox Council now being prepared has sometimes been referred to as a potential "Eighth Ecumenical Council".
they differ is in which councils they accept and what the conditions are for a council to be considered "ecumenical".
have held that a council is ecumenical only when all five patriarchs of the Pentarchy are represented at it.
Church of the East accepts two ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople.
Orthodoxy accepts three ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople, and the Council of Ephesus.
formulation of the Chalcedonian Creed caused a schism in the Alexandrian and Syriac churches.
Oriental and Eastern Churches have also been working toward reconciliation as a consequence of the ecumenical movement.
Eastern Orthodox Church accepts seven ecumenical councils, with the Council in Trullo considered a continuation of the sixth.
be considered ecumenical, Orthodox accept a council that meets the condition that it was accepted by the whole church.
it was called together legally is also important a factor.
Emperor had called for bishops to assemble in the city of Ephesus.
did not attend but sent his representative Candidian to preside.
was able to completely control the proceedings, completely neutralizing Candidian who favored Cyril's antagonist, Nestorius.
the pro-Nestorius Antiochene delegation finally arrived, they decided to convene their own council over which Candidian presided.
proceedings of both councils were reported to the emperor who decided ultimately to depose Cyril, Memnon and Nestorius.
the US decided to go ahead without Security Council approval.
the Sixth Ecumenical Council Pope Honorius and Patriarch Sergius were declared heretics.
council anathematized them and declared them tools of the devil and cast them out of the church
is their position that since the Seventh Ecumenical Council, there has been no synod or council of the same scope.
this point of view, there has been no fully "pan-Orthodox" (Ecumenical) council since 787.
including 20th century theologians Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos) of Naupactus, Fr.
Metallinos (all of whom refer repeatedly to the "Eighth and Ninth Ecumenical Councils"), Fr.
writer has even claimed that this council was summoned without the knowledge of the pope.
is little evidence of dogmatic or canonical acceptance beyond the statements of individual Anglican theologians and bishops.
including some fundamentalist Christians, condemn the ecumenical councils for other reasons.
conclude that this would lead to a logical inconsistency of a non-authoritative body fixing a supposedly authoritative source.
majority of cinemas had been in the corridor between Moscow and St. Petersburg, and most were out of commission.
the new government did not have the funds to spare for an extensive reworking of the system of filmmaking.
they initially opted for project approval and censorship guidelines while leaving what remained of the industry in private hands.
as documentaries, were the other major form of earliest Soviet cinema.
in 1921, there was not one functioning cinema in Moscow until late in the year.
of the most popular films released in the 1930s was "Circus".
notable films from the 1940s include "Alexander Nevsky" and "Ivan the Terrible".
results were films like "Repentance", which dealt with repression in Georgia, and the allegorical science fiction movie "Kin-dza-dza!".
the degree of relative artistic liberality was changed from administration to administration.
first Soviet Russian state film organization, the Film Subdepartment of the People's Commissariat of Education, was established in 1917.
world's first state-filmmaking school, the First State School of Cinematography, was established in Moscow in 1919.
the Russian Civil War, agitation trains and ships visited soldiers, workers, and peasants.
reports, and political meetings were accompanied by newsreels about events at the various fronts.
of the 1920s were the topical news serial "Kino-Pravda" and the film "Forward, Soviet!"
Vertov, whose experiments and achievements in documentary films influenced the development of Russian and world cinematography.
important films of the 1920s were Shub's historical-revolutionary films such as "The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty".
agitation films in 1918-21 were important in the development of the film industry.
in Russian filmmaking was expressed particularly in the work of Eisenstein.
Battleship Potemkin" was noteworthy for its innovative montage and metaphorical quality of its film language.
developed concepts of the revolutionary epic in the film "".
noteworthy was Pudovkin's adaptation of Gorky's "Mother" to the screen in 1926.
developed themes of revolutionary history in the film "The End of St. Petersburg" (1927).
noteworthy silent films were films dealing with contemporary life such as Barnet's "The House on Trubnaya".
director Dovzhenko was noteworthy for the historical-revolutionary epic "Zvenigora", the "Arsenal" and the poetic film "Earth".
the early 1930s, Russian filmmakers applied socialist realism to their work.
the most outstanding films was "Chapaev", a film about Russian revolutionaries and society during the Revolution and Civil War.
notable were biographical films about Vladimir Lenin such as Mikhail Romm's "Lenin in October" and "Lenin in 1918".
economy moved from the market-based New Economic Policy (NEP) to a system of central planning.
new leadership declared a "cultural revolution" in which the party would exercise control over cultural affairs, including artistic expression.
implement central planning in cinema, the new entity Soyuzkino was created in 1930.
central planning came more centralized authority over creative decision making.
more political power is centralized, the more the central authority can interfere with market development.
the 1930s censorship became more exacting with each passing year.
film projects would drag out for months or years and might be terminated at any point.
Dovzhenko drew from Ukrainian folk culture in such films as "Zemlya" ("Earth", 1930)
the way because of the capricious decision of one or another censoring committee.
central planning was supposed to increase the film industry's productivity, production levels declined steadily through the 1930s.
never again reached triple digits during the remainder of the Stalin era.
the USSR cut off its film contacts with the West.
stopped importing films after 1931 out of concern that foreign films exposed audiences to capitalist ideology.
several directors made innovative use of sound once the technology became available.
other arts, including cinema, were subsequently instructed to develop the aesthetic equivalent.
socialist realism was built on this style, which assured tidy storytelling.
aesthetic policies, enforced by the rigorous censorship apparatus of Soyuzkino, resulted in a number of formulaic films.
they did succeed in sustaining a true "cinema of the masses".
film also humanized the title character, giving him personal foibles, an ironic sense of humour, and a rough peasant charm.
pastoral comedy Volga-Volga (1938) was surpassed only by Chapayev in terms of box-office success.
Soviet film industry suffered during the period after World War II.
postwar period was marked by an end of almost all autonomy in the Soviet Union.
as the economy of the Soviet Union strengthened, film production continued to decrease.
resolution passed by the Council of Ministers in 1948 further crippled the film industry.
the council insisted that every film produced must be a masterpiece for promoting communist ideas and the Soviet system.
Stalin had the ultimate decision on whether a newly produced film was appropriate for public viewing.
response, cinemas played the same films for months at a time, many of them the works of the late 1930s.
new drew millions of people to the box office, and many theaters screened foreign films to attract larger audiences.
other twenty-six films, consisting almost entirely of American films, were only allowed to be shown in private screenings.
public release of these trophy films seems contradictory in the context of the 1940s Soviet Union.
hypothesize many possible reasons why the Soviet government showed such seemingly inexplicable leniency toward the foreign films.
general, the captured Nazi films were considered apolitical enough to be shown to the general populace.
censors found it impossible to remove the "Zionist" ideas from "Jud Suss", an anti-Semitic, Nazi propaganda film.
is very little direct evidence of how Soviet audiences received the trophy films.
order to judge the reception and popularity of these foreign films, historians have mainly relied on anecdotal evidence.
German musical comedy "The Woman of My Dreams" has received mixed reviews according to this evidence.
to him, everywhere he went people were talking about the film and whistling the songs.
the two accounts, film historians generally consider Okudzhava's more reliable than the one presented by "Kul’tura i Zhizn’".
1960s and 1970s saw the creation of many films, many of which molded Soviet and post-Soviet culture.
contributed to the creation of a large number of more philosophical and poetical films.
well-known examples of such films are those by directors Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergei Parajanov and Nikita Mikhalkov.
decades were also prominent in the production of the Eastern or Red Western.
was a respected genre, with many directors experimenting with technique.
policies of perestroika and glasnost saw a loosening of the censorship of earlier eras.

1996, FAO organised the World Food Summit, attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government.
the same time, 1,200 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an NGO forum.
its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, €15 million in donations.

projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds and agricultural implements.
people lead a life of misery and are denied the most basic of human rights: the right to food.
aim to make Food for All a reality in the 21st century and beyond.
December 2007, FAO launched its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more.
is receiving a total of around €200 million for work in 25 countries, of which €15.4 million goes to Zimbabwe.

in 1989, the organisation came under attack from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Foundation wrote that"The sad fact is that the FAO has become essentially irrelevant in combating hunger.
Saouma, the Director-General of FAO, was also criticised in Graham Hancock's book "Lords of Poverty", published in 1989.

to historian Stephen C. Pelletiere, the idea of Iranian "human wave attacks" was a misconception.
the Iranian tactics consisted of using groups of 22 man infantry squads, which moved forward to attack specific objectives.

Iraqi troops had entrenched themselves in formidable defences, and had set up a network of bunkers and artillery positions.
came so close to one another that Iranians were able to board Iraqi tanks and throw grenades inside the hulls.
Revolutionary Guards also used the T-55 tanks they had captured in earlier battles.
the attacks came to a halt and the Iranians turned to defensive measures.
16 July, Iran tried again further north and managed to push the Iraqis back.
a last-minute attack by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters stopped the Iraqis from routing the Iranians.
more similar attacks occurred around the Khorramshar-Baghdad road area towards the end of the month, but none were significantly successful.

then aimed to capture the Iraqi border town of Mandali.
Iraqis and an unknown number of Iranians died, with only minor gains for Iran.
Iraqis were able to gain air superiority towards the end of the war.
air campaigns met little opposition, striking over half of Iran.

early 1983–1984, Iran launched a series of four "Valfajr" (Dawn) Operations (that eventually numbered to 10).
Operation Dawn-1, in early February 1983, 50,000 Iranian forces attacked westward from Dezful and were confronted by 55,000 Iraqi forces.
Iranian objective was to cut off the road from Basra to Baghdad in the central sector.
Iraqis carried out 150 air sorties against the Iranians, and even bombed Dezful, Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in retribution.
Iraqi counterattack was broken up by Iran's 92nd Armoured Division.
Operation Dawn-2, the Iranian's directed insurgency operations by proxy in April 1983 by supporting the Kurds in the north.
operation incited Iraq to later conduct indiscriminate chemical attacks against the Kurds.
Iranians attempted to further exploit activities in the north on 30 July 1983, during Operation Dawn-3.
focus of Operation Dawn-4 in September 1983 was the northern sector in Iranian Kurdistan.

offensives became more complex and involved extensive maneuver warfare using primarily light infantry.
launched frequent, and sometimes smaller offensives to slowly gain ground and deplete the Iraqis through attrition.
Army and Revolutionary Guards worked together better as their tactics improved.
began training troops in infiltration, patrolling, night-fighting, marsh warfare, and mountain warfare.
also began training thousands of Revolutionary Guard commandos in amphibious warfare, as southern Iraq is marshy and filled with wetlands.
also learned to integrate foreign guerrilla units as part of their military operations.
the northern front, Iran began working heavily with the Peshmerga, Kurdish guerrillas.
oil refineries of Kirkuk became a favourite target, and were often hit by homemade Peshmerga rockets.
Iraqi high command had assumed the marshlands above Basra were natural barriers to attack, and had not reinforced them.
marshes negated Iraqi advantage in armor, and absorbed artillery rounds and bombs.
to the attack, Iranian commandos on helicopters had landed behind Iraqi lines and destroyed Iraqi artillery.
launched two preliminary attacks prior to the main offensive, Operation Dawn 5 and Dawn 6.
27 February, they had captured the island, but suffered catastrophic helicopter losses to IRAF.

Iranian warships attacked tankers with ship-to-ship missiles, while others used their radars to guide land-based anti-ship missiles to their targets.
also used aircraft and helicopters to launch Maverick missiles and unguided rockets at tankers.
missiles had been fired at about the time the plane was given a routine radio warning by "Stark".
frigate did not detect the missiles with radar, and warning was given by the lookout only moments before they struck.
missiles hit the ship, and one exploded in crew quarters, killing 37 sailors and wounding 21.
the course of the war, Iran attacked two Soviet Navy ships which were protecting Kuwaiti tankers.
Iraq's air force also began carrying out strategic bombing raids against Iranian cities.
the help of the USSR and the west, Iraq's air force had been rebuilt and expanded.
Iran, due to sanctions and lack of spare parts, had heavily curtailed its air force operations.
used Tu-22 Blinder and Tu-16 Badger strategic bombers to carry out long-range high-speed raids on Iranian cities, including Tehran.
response, the Iranians deployed their F-4 Phantoms to combat the Iraqis, and eventually they deployed F-14s as well.
1986, Iran also expanded their air defense network heavily to take the load of the fighting off the air force.
in 1987, Saddam also ordered several chemical attacks on civilian targets in Iran, such as the town of Sardasht.

the first time since early 1980, Saddam launched new offensives.
6 January 1986, the Iraqis launched an offensive attempting to retake Majnoon Island.
they were quickly bogged down into a stalemate against 200,000 Iranian infantrymen, reinforced by amphibious divisions.

ferocity of the Iranian offensive broke through the Iraqi lines.
Revolutionary Guard, with the support of tanks and artillery, broke through north of Qurna on 14 March.
then launched a pincer attack using mobile infantry and heavy artillery.
weapons were used, and the Iraqis also flooded Iranian trenches with specially constructed pipes delivering water from the Tigris River.
Iranians retreated back to the Hoveyzeh marshes while being attacked by helicopters, and the highway was recaptured by the Iraqis.
Badr resulted in 10,000–12,000 Iraqi casualties and 15,000 Iranian ones.

they would launch Scud missiles, which the Iranians could not stop.
responded to these attacks by using their own Scud missiles.
from extensive foreign help to Iraq, Iranian attacks were severely hampered by their shortages of weaponry, including heavy weaponry.
portions of them had been lost during the last several years.
by this time Iran managed to procure spare parts from various sources, helping them to restore some weapons.
managed to get some advanced weapons, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, which worked better than rocket-propelled grenades.
later reverse-engineered and produced those weapons on their own as well.
capture of Al Faw and Umm Qasr was a major goal for Iran.
drove north along the peninsula almost unopposed, capturing it after only 24 hours of fighting.
12 February 1986, the Iraqis began a counter-offensive to retake al-Faw, which failed after a week of heavy fighting.
this time, 17,000 Iraqis and 30,000 Iranians were made casualties.
battle bogged down into a World War I-style stalemate in the marshes of the peninsula.

and microeconomics, a pair of terms coined by Ragnar Frisch, are the two most general fields in economics.
models and their forecasts are used by governments to assist in the development and evaluation of economic policy.
2010, China’s government adjusted its economic policy.
encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but there are three central topics for macroeconomic research.
theories usually relate the phenomena of output, unemployment, and inflation.
of macroeconomic theory, these topics are also important to all economic agents including workers, consumers, and producers.
output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given period of time.
that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income.
output and income are usually considered equivalent and the two terms are often used interchangeably.
output is usually measured by gross domestic product (GDP) or one of the other national accounts.
look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping into recessions and that lead to faster long-term growth.
greater clarity in terms of Chinese and US policy, both economies should gain momentum.
amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e.
unemployment rate in the labor force only includes workers actively looking for jobs.
the labor-force participation rate remains near historic lows.
a result, the unemployment rate rose to 9.1% of the labor force.
who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded.
can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.
general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation.
can occur when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly.
bankers, who manage a country's money supply, try to avoid changes in price level by using monetary policy.
interest rates or reducing the supply of money in an economy will reduce inflation.
bankers try to stabilize prices to protect economies from the negative consequences of price changes.
in price level may be the result of several factors.
quantity theory of money holds that changes in price level are directly related to changes in the money supply.
economists believe that this relationship explains long-run changes in the price level.
example, a decrease in demand due to a recession can lead to lower price levels and deflation.
negative supply shock, such as an oil crisis, lowers aggregate supply and can cause inflation.
AD-AS model has become the standard textbook model for explaining the macroeconomy.
aggregate demand curve's downward slope means that more output is demanded at lower price levels.
AD–AS diagram can model a variety of macroeconomic phenomena, including inflation.
the economy faces higher costs, cost-push inflation occurs and the AS curve shifts upward to higher price levels.
IS/LM model is often used to demonstrate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy.
neoclassical growth model of Robert Solow has become a common textbook model for explaining economic growth in the long-run.
increase in the savings rate leads to a temporary increase as the economy creates more capital, which adds to output.
model suggests that economic growth in terms of output per capita depends solely on technological advances that enhance productivity.
terms of economic output, today’s EU is on par with the US.
the 1980s and 1990s endogenous growth theory arose to challenge neoclassical growth theory.
policy is usually implemented through two sets of tools: fiscal and monetary policy.
banks implement monetary policy by controlling the money supply through several mechanisms.
policy is not implemented by directly targeting the supply of money.
banks continuously shift the money supply to maintain a targeted fixed interest rate.
of them allow the interest rate to fluctuate and focus on targeting inflation rates instead.
banks generally try to achieve high output without letting loose monetary policy that create large amounts of inflation.
monetary policy can be ineffective in situations such as a liquidity trap.
don’t think monetary policy, even unorthodox monetary policy, can do the job.
interest rates and inflation are near zero, the central bank cannot loosen monetary policy through conventional means.
banks can use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing to help increase output.
monetary policies have created a massive overhang of liquidity.
allows lower interest rates for a broader class of assets beyond government bonds.
policy is the use of government's revenue and expenditure as instruments to influence the economy.
spending does not have to make up for the entire output gap.
is a multiplier effect that boosts the impact of government spending.
effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out.
the government takes on spending projects, it limits the amount of resources available for the private sector to use.
out occurs when government spending simply replaces private sector output instead of adding additional output to the economy.
there are some goods that the private sector is simply unable to provide.
out also occurs when government spending raises interest rates, which limits investment.
stabilizers do not suffer from the policy lags of discretionary fiscal policy.
usually favor monetary over fiscal policy because it has two major advantages.
monetary policy is generally implemented by independent central banks instead of the political institutions that control fiscal policy.
then, countries around the world have made their central banks independent.
fiscal policy is in a muddle, so is monetary policy.
the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task.
such policies in place, the comfort zone for central banks is enlarged sufficiently to loosen monetary policy.
central banks are less likely to make decisions based on political motives.
pressure on Europe’s central bank may be the reason for that timid move.
monetary policy suffers shorter inside lags and outside lags than fiscal policy.
descended from the once divided fields of business cycle theory and monetary theory.
quantity theory of money was particularly influential prior to World War II.
took many forms, including the version based on the work of Irving Fisher:
the Great Depression struck, classical economists had difficulty explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed.
classical theory, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold.
also noted the role uncertainty and animal spirits can play in the economy.
generation following Keynes combined the macroeconomics of the "General Theory" with neoclassical microeconomics to create the neoclassical synthesis.
the 1950s, most economists had accepted the synthesis view of the macroeconomy.
Friedman updated the quantity theory of money to include a role for money demand.
generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.
also challenged the Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment.
also became politically unpopular when the central banks created recessions in order to slow inflation.
central development in new classical thought came when Robert Lucas introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics.
new classical economists introduced rational expectations into their models, they showed that monetary policy could only have a limited impact.
interest rates already low, the room for monetary policy is limited.
advocated models based on fundamental economic theory that would, in principle, be structurally accurate as economies changed.
models were created by combining fundamental equations from neo-classical microeconomics.
technological shocks are only the more prominent of a myriad of possible shocks to the system that can be modeled.
questions about the theory behind RBC models, they have clearly been influential in economic methodology.
fusion of elements from different schools of thought has been dubbed the new neoclassical synthesis.
models are now used by many central banks and are a core part of contemporary macroeconomics.

with Lund, Malmö is the region's economic and education hub.
economy of Malmö was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction related industries, such as concrete factories.
a result, Malmö had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s.
1990-1995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona.
addition to the trade and budget deficits, there is a jobs deficit.
during the last few years there has been a revival.
main contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the Øresund Bridge.
the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed.

mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin.
mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids.
are over 5,300 known mineral species; over 5,070 of these have been approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA).
diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by the Earth's chemistry.
and oxygen constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals.
in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various species, which were determined by the mineral's geological environment when formed.
in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals.
can be described by their various physical properties, which are related to their chemical structure and composition.
distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting, and specific gravity.
specific tests for describing minerals include magnetism, taste or smell, radioactivity and reaction to acid.
are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification.
silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of polymerization in the chemical structure.
important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.
first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two.
first criterion means that a mineral has to form by a natural process, which excludes anthropogenic compounds.
at room temperature, in the simplest sense, is synonymous to the mineral being solid.
specifically, a compound has to be stable or metastable at 25 °C.
advances have included extensive study of liquid crystals, which also extensively involve mineralogy.
are chemical compounds, and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula.
ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of macroscopic physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage.
have been several recent proposals to amend the definition to consider biogenic or amorphous substances as minerals.
formal definition of a mineral approved by the IMA in 1995:
if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound, then the product can be accepted as a mineral."
classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science.
changes have included the addition of an organic class, in both the new Dana and the Strunz classification schemes.
organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with hydrocarbons.
Nickel (1995) exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to.
distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves.
example, the IMA commissioned "Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry Working Group" deals with minerals in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.
cycles have contributed to the formation of minerals for billions of years.
can precipitate metals from solution, contributing to the formation of ore deposits.
to the International Mineralogical Association's listing, over 60 biominerals had been discovered, named, and published.
minerals (a sub-set tabulated in Lowenstam (1981)) are considered minerals proper according to the Skinner (2005) definition.
formal Nickel (1995) definition explicitly mentioned crystallinity as a key to defining a substance as a mineral.
2011 article defined icosahedrite, an aluminium-iron-copper alloy as mineral; named for its unique natural icosahedral symmetry, it is a quasicrystal.
rock is either an aggregate of one or more minerals, or not composed of minerals at all.
other minerals in the rock are termed accessory, and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock.
can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; coal is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon.
rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals.
around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting.
valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as industrial minerals.
are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal.
are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO), an ore of tin.
are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity.
are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones.
are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality.
there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined.
example, the biotite series is represented by variable amounts of the endmembers phlogopite, siderophyllite, annite, and eastonite.
contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure.
example is amethyst, which is a purple variety of quartz.
Dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species.
abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth.
majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust.
elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust.
minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body.
a limestone, calcite or aragonite (both CaCO) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate.
example, kyanite, AlSiO forms from the metamorphism of aluminium-rich shales; it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock, such quartzite.
chemical composition may vary between end member species of a solid solution series.
substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals.
nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system.
a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another.
the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution.
significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra.
polyhedra are geometric representation of how a cation is surrounded by an anion.
mineralogy, due its abundance in the crust, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen.
base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron— one Si surrounded by four O.
in temperature and pressure, and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample.
in composition can be caused by processes such as weathering or metasomatism (hydrothermal alteration).
in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes tectonic or magmatic movement into differing physical regimes.
process of mineralogical alteration is related to the rock cycle.
example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.
feldspar (KAlSiO) is a mineral commonly found in granite, a plutonic igneous rock.
exposed to weathering, it reacts to form kaolinite (AlSiO(OH), a sedimentary mineral, and silicic acid):
low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form pyrophyllite (AlSiO(OH)):
metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz:
a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting.
mineral can be identified by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation.
properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity.
structure results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral.
are restricted to 32 point groups, which differ by their symmetry.
groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families.
a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure.
contrast, polymorphs are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure.
aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals— kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite— which share the chemical formula AlSiO.
is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group.
difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure.
has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO).
in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral.
sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces, and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences.
is the intergrowth of two or more crystal of a single mineral species.
geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry.
or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel.
twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin.
twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis.
to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope.
crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.
hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching.
physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral.
most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale.
by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it.
scale ranges from talc, a phyllosilicate, to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material.
indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface, with regards to its quality and intensity.
are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories.
and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite.
diaphaneity of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it.
minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through it.
example of such a mineral is muscovite (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows.
minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent.
and nephrite (mineral forms of jade are examples of minerals with this property).
that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.
diaphaneity of a mineral depends on thickness of the sample.
contrast, some minerals, such as hematite or pyrite are opaque even in thin-section.
is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.
is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except in the case of incandescence, which does not apply to minerals).
broad classes of elements are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour.
elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.
contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities.
example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral corundum.
colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of interference of light waves.
streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements or any weathering surface.
is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements.
testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the "streak plate" instead.
in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage.
contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.
cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types.
occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions.
cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas.
cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes.
cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.
cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.
general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal.
that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum.
classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines.
latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in native copper.
can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic.
dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m or g/cm.
forming minerals— typically silicates or occasionally carbonates— have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5.
variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity.
dilute acid (often 10% HCl) aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes.
acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO]) group, which causes the affected area to effervesce, giving off carbon dioxide gas.
test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered.
example of this test is done when distinguish calcite from dolomite, especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively).
common minerals, magnetite exhibits this property strongly, and it is also present, albeit not as strongly, in pyrrhotite and ilmenite.
NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, sylvite, has a pronounced bitter taste.
have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered.
is a rare property; minerals may be composed of radioactive elements.
could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in uraninite, autunite, and carnotite, or as trace impurities.
non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.
lessons concern economics, especially the economics of information.
are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra.
close-packed structures, which is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space.
to linked silica tetrahedra include SO (sulfate), PO (phosphate), AsO (arsenate), and VO (vanadate).
non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.
two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust.
important rock-forming silicates include the feldspars, quartz, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and micas.
base of unit of a silicate mineral is the [SiO] tetrahedron.
the vast majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen.
other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge.
(or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners.
are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners.
silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners.
ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.
silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.
also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization.
all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2.
silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds.
12% of the Earth's crust, quartz (SiO) is the most abundant mineral species.
has several polymorphs, including tridymite and cristobalite at high temperatures, high-pressure coesite, and ultra-high pressure stishovite.
silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz.
counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573 °C at 1 bar).
are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%.
twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars.
opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.
often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses.
form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure.
are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5.
These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups.
that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.
two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.
chlorite group is related to mica group, but a brucite-like (Mg(OH)) layer between the T-O-T stacks.
can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics.
whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g.
contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly pyroxenes, while double-chain silicates are often amphiboles.
varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca, Fe and Mg to balance the negative charge on the backbone.
are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.
or ring silicates, have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3.
rings are most common, with a base structure of [SiO]; examples include the tourmaline group and beryl.
ring structures exist, with 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 having been described.
have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula XYZ(BO)TOVW.
cyclosilicates include beryl, AlBeSiO, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish).
is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.
also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen.
most common disilicates by far are members of the epidote group.
are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to metapelites.
presence of iron as Fe and Fe helps understand oxygen fugacity, which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.
consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations.
termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g.
orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard.
rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group.
aluminosilicates—kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all AlSiO—are structurally composed of one [SiO] tetrahedron, and one Al in octahedral coordination.
the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)SiO consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite.
mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, MnSiO.
are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group.
pyralspite garnets have Al in the Y position: pyrope (MgAl(SiO)), almandine (FeAl(SiO)), and spessartine (MnAl(SiO)).
ugrandite garnets have Ca in the X position: uvarovite (CaCr(SiO)), grossular (CaAl(SiO)) and andradite (CaFe(SiO)).
there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.
has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986.
(AlSiO(F, OH), often found in granitic pegmatites associated with tourmaline, is a common gemstone mineral.
elements are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements.
mineral group includes native metals, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions.
elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.
gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper.
platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group.
group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic; for example, they lack the malleability of metals.
tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity.
powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered.
(FeS), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments.
is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid.
the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.
minerals are divided into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides.
oxides are characterized by O as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding.
can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations.
with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (CuO) and water ice.
group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (AlO), and hematite (FeO).
major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of XYO.
of species include spinel (MgAlO), chromite (FeCrO), and magnetite (FeO).
halide minerals are compounds where a halogen (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine) is the main anion.
examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), sylvite (KCl), fluorite (CaF).
and sylvite commonly form as evaporites, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks.
carbonate minerals are those were the main anionic group is carbonate, [CO].
tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid.
to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates.
are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments.
most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble.
tend to be transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile.
anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions.
barite group has the general formula XSO, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation.
most common phosphate is the apatite group; common species within this group are fluorapatite (Ca(PO)F), chlorapatite (Ca(PO)Cl) and hydroxylapatite (Ca(PO)(OH)).
in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates.
rare compounds contain organic carbon, but can be formed by a geologic process.
example, whewellite, CaCO⋅HO is an oxalate that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins.

modern academic usage, the term Mesopotamia often also has a chronological connotation.
encompasses the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, both of which have their headwaters in the Armenian Highlands.
rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region.
routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult.
the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the Persian Gulf.
breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons.
this period Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly developed and socially complex states.
another study, scientists analysed DNA from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in Germany.
earliest language written in Mesopotamia was Sumerian, an agglutinative language isolate.
with Sumerian, Semitic languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia.
varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babylonian period.
fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries.
last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.
in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language.
literally means "wedge-shaped", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay.
standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms.
early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master.
only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its use.
archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated.
has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund.
were extant in towns and temples during the Babylonian Empire.
old Sumerian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn."
characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up.
division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh.
mathematics and science was based on a sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system.
is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-degree circle.
Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids.
there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used pi as 25/8 (3.125 instead of 3.14159~).
measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.
Sumerian times, temple priesthoods had attempted to associate current events with certain positions of the planets and stars.
Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict eclipses and solstices.
astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon.
origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.
the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy.
new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.
only Greek Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a heliocentric model of planetary motion was Seleucus of Seleucia (b.
with contemporary Egyptian medicine, the Babylonians introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and prescriptions.
symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages, creams and pills.
discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his "Diagnostic Handbook".
include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.
people invented many technologies including metal and copper-working, glass and lamp making, textile weaving, flood control, water storage, and irrigation.
were also one of the first Bronze Age societies in the world.
were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals.
the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations.
Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki.
Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?.
earliest form of logic was developed by the Babylonians, notably in the rigorous nonergodic nature of their social systems.
thought was axiomatic and is comparable to the "ordinary logic" described by John Maynard Keynes.
thought was also based on an open-systems ontology which is compatible with ergodic axioms.
was employed to some extent in Babylonian astronomy and medicine.
thought had a considerable influence on early Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy.
theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:
songs were written for the gods but many were written to describe important events.
were sung to children who passed them on to their children.
songs were passed on through many generations as an oral tradition until writing was more universal.
songs provided a means of passing on through the centuries highly important information about historical events.
Oud (Arabic:العود) is a small, stringed musical instrument used by the Mesopotamians.
oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago.
is on a cylinder seal currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon.
image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing right-handed.
oud is regarded as a precursor to the European lute.
Arabic name, with the definite article, is the source of the word'lute'.)
also played "majore", a game similar to the sport rugby, but played with a ball made of wood.
also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, now known as the "Royal Game of Ur."
boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade.
had to stay home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children.
for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had rights.
could own property and, if they had good reason, get a divorce.
of graves have been excavated in parts of Mesopotamia, revealing information about Mesopotamian burial habits.
the city of Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions.
children were put in big "jars" which were placed in the family chapel.
graves have been found with very precious objects in them.
of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun.
agriculture spread southwards from the Zagros foothills with the Samara and Hadji Muhammed culture, from about 5,000 BC.
was comparable in some ways to modern post-Keynesian economics, but with a more "anything goes" approach.
word Ensi was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture.
are known to have worked most frequently within agriculture, especially in the grounds of temples or palaces.
rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials).
irrigation, the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies.
is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia.
Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts.
settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine.
were too many risks involved to make slavery practical (i.e.
the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities.
geography of Mesopotamia had a profound impact on the political development of the region.
consequences for the region’s political economy are profound.
among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous.
each Sumerian city became a city-state, independent of the others and protective of its independence.
times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries.
a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare.
Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings.
empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations.
kings named themselves“king of the universe” or“great king”.
common name was“shepherd”, as kings had to look after their people.
Assyria grew into an empire, it was divided into smaller parts, called provinces.
of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad.
all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.
also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built.
this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire.
Babylon was quite a small state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of Hammurabi's rule.
was known as“the law maker”, and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia.
was later called Babylonia, which meant "the gateway of the gods."
early king Lugalbanda was supposed to have built the white walls around the city.
city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals.
this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system.
times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities.
helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states.
empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries.
of Mesopotamia created the first law codes, drawn from legal precedence and decisions made by kings.
of the laws show a progressive weakening of the rights of women, and increasing severity in the treatment of slaves
Protoliterate period, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals.
Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BC, part man and part lion.
from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men.
comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded.
before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.
study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available archaeological evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices.
surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.
are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur.
selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype.
is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in heritable traits of a population over time.
Darwin popularised the term "natural selection", and compared it with artificial selection.
occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations.
the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits.
with certain variants of the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful, variants.
other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.
union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern evolutionary synthesis of the mid-20th century.
addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level.
genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.
struggle for existence was later described by the Islamic writer Al-Jahiz in the 9th century.
classical arguments were reintroduced in the 18th century by Pierre Louis Maupertuis and others, including Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.
acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of "On the Origin of Species".
1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for adaptation and speciation.
defined natural selection as the "principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved."
concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce.
result of this would be the formation of new species."
he had his theory, Darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining evidence before making his idea public.
published a detailed account of his evidence and conclusions in "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.
Darwin and his contemporaries, natural selection was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection.
the publication of "On the Origin of Species", educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form.
selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed before the basic concepts of genetics.
Fisher developed the required mathematical language and wrote "The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection" (1930).
S. Haldane introduced the concept of the "cost" of natural selection.
Mayr recognised the key importance of reproductive isolation for speciation in his "Systematics and the Origin of Species" (1942).
synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today.
term "natural selection" is most often defined to operate on heritable traits, because these directly participate in evolution.
variation occurs among the individuals of any population of organisms.
if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population.
gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice.
selection is purposive where natural selection is not, though biologists often use teleological language to describe it.
evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing.
fitness of a particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with that genotype.
biology, competition is an interaction between organisms in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another.
may be because both rely on a limited supply of a resource such as food, water, or territory.
may be within or between species, and may be direct or indirect.
is modelled by "r/K" selection theory, which is based on Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson's work on island biogeography.
this theory, selective pressures drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: "r"- or "K"-selection.
terms, "r" and "K", can be illustrated in a of population dynamics:
"r" is the growth rate of the population ("N "), and"K" is the carrying capacity of its local environmental setting.
"r"-selected species exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each with a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood.
particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured.
selection can be divided according to its effect on genetic diversity.
polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.
option is to classify selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts.
can also be classified by the level or unit of selection.
kin selection and intragenomic conflict, gene-level selection provides a more apt explanation of the underlying process.
is an ongoing debate over the degree to which group selection occurs in nature.
selection can be classified according to the resource being competed for.
selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes at the expense of viability.
selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide.
Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.
can be "intrasexual", between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male competition, or "intersexual", where one gender chooses mates.
selection is seen in action in the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.
the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases.
similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects.
of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare.
but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable embryos.
such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait spreads in the population.
famous example of a vestigial structure, the eye of the blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.
requires a degree of reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow.
problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations.
is determined by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and the environment in which the organism lives.
example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.
traits are governed by only a single gene, but most traits are influenced by the interactions of many genes.
traits like these are always the result of interactions between genes and environment.
can be divided into three classes, on the basis of its effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection.
process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype.
process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population.
selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.
forms of balancing selection do not result in fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population.
portion of all genetic variation is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or significant difference in fitness.
among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations.
genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation.
a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness.
after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift.
selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation.
the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance.
linkage occurs when the loci of two alleles are in close proximity on a chromosome.
chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is inversely related to the distance between them.
sweeps occur when an allele becomes more common in a population as a result of positive selection.
sweeps can be detected by measuring linkage disequilibrium, or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population.
inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters—and provoked the strongest opposition.
life originated from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology.
prominent hypothesis is that life first appeared in the form of short self-replicating RNA polymers.
conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources.
recent years, a modern version of this theory has been proposed by.
social implications of the theory of evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy.
racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect."
have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.
algorithms are particularly useful when applied to problems whose energy landscape is very rough or has many local minima.
will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895.
prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.
1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer.
invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite.
a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite.
1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled "The merchant of death is dead", in a French newspaper.
it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature.
article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered.
10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage.
1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.
Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900.
function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.
accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left.
Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.
to the statutes, the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm.
the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes.
they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.
Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-rays and Philipp Lenard's work on cathode rays.
the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists had made significant contributions.
Academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for Jacobus van't Hoff.
Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics.
other prizes are not awarded in the “chemical sciences” or the “physical sciences.”
Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature.
group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded.
including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet.
explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet.
first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring.
the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.
man was later able to receive the diploma and medal.
though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly.
prize was awarded in any category from 1940–42, due to the occupation of Norway by Germany.
the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.
the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile.
it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden.
members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes.
following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time.
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates.
Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.
individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area.
deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.
Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.
nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize.
nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.
Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields.
along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.
institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote.
decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.
maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award.
for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.
the Peace Prize is not awarded, the money is split among the scientific prizes.
1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement.
committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.
will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made "during the preceding year".
avoid repeating this embarrassment, the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time.
interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline.
Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.
Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work.
example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.
instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised.
discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died.
recipients'lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony.
award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.
first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners.
Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel after the award ceremony.
laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize.
lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.
the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010.
Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years.
2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals.
Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.
medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse.
instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.
image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize.
reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.
medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold.
then, they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold.
World War II, the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping.
the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.
diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.
of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.
amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year.
2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million, €950,000).
there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients.
is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes.
other criticisms, the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda, and of omitting more deserving candidates.
have also been accused of Eurocentrism, especially for the Literature Prize.
the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ.
led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members.
and Thọ were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973.
when the award was announced, both sides were still engaging in hostilities.
critics were of the opinion that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite, responsible for widening the war.
after the award was announced, one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned.
controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009.
award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.
alleged that Jelinek's works were "a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure."
to "The Washington Post", many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work.
1949, the neurologist António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy.
previous year, Dr. Walter Freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out.
members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.
high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out.
physicist Arnold Sommerfeld was nominated 81 times but an award was never made.
Kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons.
heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism.
strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.
five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles.
Franklin, a key contributor in that discovery, died of ovarian cancer four years earlier.
the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.
Curie family has received the most prizes, with four prizes won by five individual laureates.
Curie received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911).
husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 Physics prize with her.
daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie.
no family matches the Curie family's record, there have been several with two laureates.
J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that electrons are particles.
son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves.
Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer.
Bohr won the Physics prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975.
Kornberg received the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1959; Kornberg's son, Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006.
Myrdal, Peace Prize laureate in 1982, was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal who was awarded the Economics Prize in 1974.
a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that's recognisable worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction.
the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler hindered Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk from accepting their prizes.
of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II.
memorial symbol "Planet of Alfred Nobel" was opened in Dnipropetrovsk University of Economics and Law in 2008.
the globe, there are 802 Nobel laureates'reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles.

description of nation is pinned to the shared experience of being radicalized and termed as Black.
June 23, 2012 South Korea's population touched 50 million, making it the 26th country to reach that mark.
tend to equate nationality or citizenship with membership in a single, homogeneous ethnic group and "race" (injong 인종, in Korean).
common language and race also are viewed as important elements in Korean identity.
idea of multiracial and multiethnic nations still strikes many South Koreans as odd or even contradictory.
the first official census, taken in 1949, the total population of South Korea was calculated at 20,188,641 people.
of January 1, 1989, the population of South Korea was estimated to be approximately 42.2 million.

are several implications and issues associated with an aging population.
rapidly aging population is likely to have several negative implications on the labour force.
is aging very rapidly, and its working-age population will begin to shrink within a few years.
particular, experts predict that this might lead to a shrinking of the labour force.
such, there would be a decrease in the percentage of economically active people in the population.
with rapid aging, it is highly likely that there would be an imbalance in the young-old percentage of the workforce.
shows that the labour force is indeed largely made up of middle-aged workers.
possible consequence might be that South Korea would be a less attractive candidate for investment.
might decide to relocate to countries like Vietnam and China, where there is an abundance of cheaper, younger labour.
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Seoul, by far the largest urban settlement, had a population of about 190,000 people.
1945 and 1985, the urban population of South Korea grew from 14.5% to 65.4% of the total population.
of this urban increase was attributable to migration rather than to natural growth of the urban population.
birth rates have generally been lower than the national average.
extent of urbanization in South Korea, however, is not fully revealed in these statistics.
population was defined in the national census as being restricted to those municipalities with 50,000 or more inhabitants.
dislocation caused by the Korean War accounted for the rapid increase in urban population during the early 1950s.
of thousands of refugees, many of them from North Korea, streamed into the cities.
1985 the largest cities were Seoul (9,645,932 inhabitants), Busan (3,516,807), Daegu (2,030,672), Incheon (1,387,491), Gwangju (906,129), and Daejeon (866,695).
to government statistics, the population of Seoul, one of the world's largest cities, surpassed 10 million people in late 1988.
average annual population growth rate during the late 1980s was more than 3%.
of this growth was attributable to migration rather than to natural increase.
factors cited by immigrants included "education" and "a more convenient area to live."
1985 the population of Seoul constituted 23.8% of the national total.
cities, however, experienced equal and, in many cases, greater expansion than the capital.
figures show that Ulsan's population increased eighteenfold, growing from 30,000 to 551,300 inhabitants between 1960 and 1985.
urban growth has brought familiar problems to developed and developing countries alike.
countries in the early stages of growth need to understand these trends.
and developed nations alike must invest in reducing emissions.
and developing countries alike would benefit from greater economic-policy coordination.
construction of large numbers of high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul and other large cities alleviated housing shortages to some extent.
the late 1980s, squatter areas consisting of one-story shacks still existed in some parts of Seoul.

makes the spreadsheet useful for "what-if" analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation.
spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets, and can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form.
performing basic arithmetic and mathematical functions, modern spreadsheets provide built-in functions for common financial and statistical operations.
programs also provide conditional expressions, functions to convert between text and numbers, and functions that operate on strings of text.
available in 1969, was the first electronic spreadsheet on mainframe and time sharing computers.
1-2-3 was the leading spreadsheet when DOS was the dominant operating system.
now has the largest market share on the Windows and Macintosh platforms.
single cell can be referred to by addressing its row and column, "C10" for instance.
system of cell references was introduced in VisiCalc, and known as "A1 notation".
spreadsheets have the concept of a "range", a group of cells, normally contiguous.
instance, one can refer to the first ten cells in the first column with the range "A1:A10".
modern spreadsheet applications, several spreadsheets, often known as "worksheets" or simply "sheets", are gathered together to form a "workbook".
in a multi-sheet book add the sheet name to their reference, for instance, "Sheet 1!C10".
systems extend this syntax to allow cell references to different workbooks.
might include the string of text codice_1, the number codice_2 or the date codice_3.
make such a formula, one simply replaces a number with a cell reference.
instance, the formula codice_6 would produce the result of multiplying the value in cell C10 by the number 5.
C10 holds the value codice_7 the result will be codice_5.
C10 might also hold its own formula referring to other cells, and so on.
ability to chain formulas together is what gives a spreadsheet its power.

CSS offered a similar product, CSSTAB, which had a moderate timesharing user base by the early 1970s.
was not a WYSIWYG interactive spreadsheet program, it was a simple scripting language for spreadsheets.
user defined the names and labels for the rows and columns, then the formulas that defined each row or column.
IBM Financial Planning and Control System was developed in 1976, by Brian Ingham at IBM Canada.

changed dramatically with the introduction of Lotus 1-2-3 in November, 1982, and release for sale in January, 1983.
it was written especially for the IBM PC, it had good performance and became the killer app for this PC.
1-2-3, along with its competitor Borland Quattro, soon displaced VisiCalc.
Windows 3.x platforms of the early 1990s made it possible for Excel to take market share from Lotus.
the time Lotus responded with usable Windows products, Microsoft had begun to assemble their Office suite.
1995, Excel was the market leader, edging out Lotus 1-2-3, and in 2013, IBM discontinued Lotus-1-2-3 altogether.
is a free, cross-platform spreadsheet program that is part of the GNOME Free Software Desktop Project.
Calc and the very closely related LibreOffice Calc (using the LGPL license) are free and open-source spreadsheets.
the advent of advanced web technologies such as Ajax circa 2005, a new generation of online spreadsheets has emerged.

tools for programming sheets, visualizing data, remotely connecting sheets, displaying cells'dependencies, etc.
"cell" can be thought of as a box for holding data.
most implementations, many worksheets may be located within a single spreadsheet.
worksheet is simply a subset of the spreadsheet divided for the sake of clarity.
cell may contain a value or a formula, or it may simply be left empty.
value can be entered from the computer keyboard by directly typing into the cell itself.
formula may rely on the value of other cells, but those cells are likewise restricted to user-entered data or formulas.
is no natural mechanism for permanently modifying the contents of a cell unless the user manually modifies the cell's contents.
the context of programming languages, this yields a limited form of first-order functional programming.
earlier spreadsheets required a manual request to recalculate, since recalculation of large or complex spreadsheets often reduced data entry speed.
generally requires that there are no circular dependencies in a spreadsheet.
shared, Web-based spreadsheets, it applies to "immediately" updating cells another user has updated.
entered, selected cells (or the entire spreadsheet) can optionally be "locked" to prevent accidental overwriting.
cell or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value is displayed.
adding a% sign after a numeric value would tag the cell as a percentage cell format.
cell contents are not changed by this format, only the displayed value.
cell formats such as "numeric" or "currency" can also specify the number of decimal places.
reason for this usage is for creating or running macros that repeat a command across many sheets.
of named variables and named functions also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent.
place of a named cell, an alternative approach is to use a cell (or grid) reference.
current spreadsheets use the A1 style, some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option.
cell on a different sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as:
a spreadsheet, references to cells automatically update when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted.
techniques, after many spreadsheet recalculations, (usually) converge on the correct values for those cells.
instead of using a named range of cells, a range reference can be used.
most advanced examples allow inversion and rotation operations which can slice and project the data set in various ways.
formula identifies the calculation needed to place the result in the cell it is contained within.
cell containing a formula therefore has two display components; the formula itself and the resulting value.
formula assigns values to a cell or range of cells, and typically has the format:
a cell contains a formula, it often contains references to other cells.
value is the value of the referenced cell or some derivation of it.
that cell in turn references other cells, the value depends on the values of those.
implementations also offer functions to access custom-build functions, remote data, and applications.
of its ease of use, formatting and hyperlinking capabilities, many spreadsheets are used solely for this purpose.
the figure, the name "sq" is user-assigned, and function "sq" is introduced using the "Visual Basic" editor supplied with Excel.
Manager " displays the spreadsheet definitions of named variables"x "&"y".
themselves cannot write into the worksheet, but simply return their evaluation.
in Microsoft Excel, subroutines can write values or text found within the subroutine directly to the spreadsheet.
generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object.
the late 1980s and early 1990s, first Javelin Software and Lotus Improv appeared.
multi-dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and algorithms in various self-documenting ways, including simultaneous multiple synchronized views.
complex model can be dissected and understood by others who had no role in its creation.
were independent of worksheets—variables, and therefore data, could not be destroyed by deleting a row, column or entire worksheet.
instance, January's costs are subtracted from January's revenues, regardless of where or whether either appears in a worksheet.
if costs were entered by week and revenues by month, the program could allocate or interpolate as appropriate.
a spreadsheet on the Mac, went further and explicitly supported
that have a formula language based upon logical expressions, rather than arithmetic expressions are known as logical spreadsheets.
spreadsheets can be used to reason deductively about their cell values.
people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than by writing the equivalent sequential program.
"spreadsheet program" is designed to perform general computation tasks using spatial relationships rather than time as the primary organizing principle.
usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells they depend on change.
spreadsheet cells formulas are not generally invertible, though, this technique is of somewhat limited value.
of the concepts common to sequential programming models have analogues in the spreadsheet world.
spreadsheets represented a major step forward in quantitative modeling, they have deficiencies.

passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw for the first time the effects of the Reformation.
became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife.
was all the more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy.
did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous.
note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles.

23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God.
even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine.
was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage.
1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod.
kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth.
baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.
is difficult to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days.
is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus'pension that had previously been granted by Archbishop Warham.
Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence.

1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others.
objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the Act of Supremacy did not define his role.
created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy.
the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction.
is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner.
he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents.
after the miscarriage, the king started to take an interest in Jane Seymour.
24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce.
of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April.
was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell.
it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable.
days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.

1538, the king and Cromwell arranged with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance.
had been seeking a new embassy from the Schmalkaldic League since summer 1537.
initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to Lambeth Palace under Cranmer's chairmanship.
talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop's strenuous efforts.
negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king.
colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry's Privy Council, had died earlier in the year.
king chose as his replacement Cranmer's conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice.
result was a thorough dismissal by the king of many of the Germans'chief concerns.
reformer Philipp Melanchthon was aware that he was very much admired by Henry.
early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy.

Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League.
the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce.
resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences.
old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June.
immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer.
as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the king defending the past work of Cromwell.
now found himself in a politically prominent position, with no one else to shoulder the burden.
the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority.

articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543.
king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night.
archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made.
commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.
the plot against Cranmer was proceeding, the reformers were being attacked on other fronts.
20 April, the Convocation reconvened to consider the revision of the Bishops'Book.
presided over the sub-committees, but the conservatives were able to overturn many reforming ideas, including justification by faith.
May to August, reformers were examined, forced to recant, or imprisoned.
five months, Henry took no action on the accusations against his archbishop.
conspiracy was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself.
to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him.
investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator.
show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring.

mourned Henry's death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard.
beard was also a sign of his break with the past.
the regency of Seymour, the reformers were now part of the establishment.
book consisted of twelve homilies of which four were written by Cranmer.
reassertion of the doctrine of justification by faith elicited a strong reaction from Gardiner.
he narrowed the range of good works that would be considered necessary and reinforced the primacy of faith.
eucharistic views, which had already moved away from official Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers.
had been in contact with Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League.
wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology.
March 1549, the city of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave.
immediately invited the men to come to England and promised that they would be placed in English universities.
they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence.
the use of English in worship services spread, the need for a complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident.
is difficult to ascertain how much of the Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition.
problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked.
use of the new Prayer Book was made compulsory on 9 June 1549.
triggered a series of protests in Devon and Cornwall, the Prayer Book Rebellion.
early July, the uprising had spread to other parts in the east of England.
wrote a strong response to these demands to the King in which he denounced the wickedness of the rebellion.
21 July, Cranmer commandeered St Paul's Cathedral where he vigorously defended the official Church line.
Prayer Book Rebellion and other events had a negative effect on the Seymour regency.
Privy Council became divided when a set of dissident Councillors banded together behind John Dudley in order to oust Seymour.
and two other Councillors, William Paget, and Thomas Smith initially rallied behind Seymour.
was initially imprisoned in the Tower, but he was shortly released on 6 February 1550 and returned to the Council.
first result of co-operation and consultation between Cranmer and Bucer was the Ordinal, the liturgy for the ordination of priests.
was missing in the first Prayer Book and was not published until 1550.
adopted Bucer's draft and created three services for commissioning a deacon, a priest, and a bishop.
was the first full-length book to bear Cranmer's name on the title-page.
Bucer assisted in the development of the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress.
however, made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him.
incident was initiated by John Hooper, a follower of Heinrich Bullinger who had recently returned from Zürich.
was unhappy with Cranmer's Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments.
church's forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked.
Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper's position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority.
was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments.
vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained.
role in politics was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour was arrested on charges of treason.
was the beginning of the breach between Cranmer and Dudley.
was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency.
original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome.
the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work.
and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance.
partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr.
had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter.
new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory.
Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November.
the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention.
travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle.
the north of the country, a Syrian-based militia, under Fawzi al-Kaukji, attacked Jewish villages.
a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion.
27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it.
origins of the Statement that eventually became the "Forty-Two Articles" are equally obscure.
early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles.
1551 Cranmer presented a version of a statement to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous.
did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision.
became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade.
was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.
VI became seriously ill from tuberculosis and the councillors were told that he did not have long to live.
May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving.
sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer.
17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act.
told him that he supported what he wrote in his will.
mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary's favour and support for Jane in the council fell.
Mary was proclaimed queen, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk were imprisoned.
8 August he led Edward's funeral according to the rites of the Prayer Book.
these months, he advised others, including Peter Martyr, to flee England, but he himself chose to stay.
bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy, such as Edmund Bonner, had their old positions restored.
surprisingly, the government regarded Cranmer's declaration as tantamount to sedition.
was sent straight to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley.
13 November 1553 Cranmer and four others were brought to trial for treason, found guilty, and condemned to death.

has facilitated the expansion of world music's audiences and scope.
music gives makes us think and feel in different ways.
term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry.
it can be described as "local music from out there", or "someone else's local music".
a result, definitions of the genre have become particularly varied, and determined by particularly wide-ranging and varied opinions.
more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, "world music" means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion.
of popular forms of world music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g.
and Chinese koto music, Indian raga music, Tibetan chants), Eastern European folk music (e.g.
this time, Stivell's contemporary, Welsh singer-songwriter Meic Stevens popularised Welsh folk music.
recently, other Welsh-language bands such as Calan and 9 Bach have achieved international acclaim.
broad category of world music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions.
dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots.
examples are Tibetan bowls, Tuvan throat singing, Gregorian chant or Native American flute music.
music blended with new-age music is a sound, loosely classified as the hybrid genre, ethnic fusion.
jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed "world fusion jazz", "ethnic jazz" or "non-Western jazz".

around this time, Cultural Co-operation started the Music Village Festival.
regular series of free world music festivals continues to run.
also started a network of world music artists to help promote their work.
the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done:
first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under.
included "world beat" and prefixing words such as "hot" or "tropical" to existing genre titles.
main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service.
the scientific point of view, the main problem is a lack of knowledge.
larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store.
was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores.
overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer.
the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer.
cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign.
most wealthy industrialized countries, large amounts of immigration from other regions has been ongoing for many decades.
music in the United Kingdom or Chicano rock in the United States would be two obvious examples.
singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes started of her international career from Germany mixing traditional elements of Son with pop.
diverse nature of major Western cities has changed the pace of musical intermixing.
new bands and new genres are built from the ground up by young performers.

music radio programs today often play African hip hop or reggae artists, crossover Bhangra and Latin American jazz groups, etc.
media for world music include public radio, webcasting, the BBC, NPR, and ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation).
in market context, "ethnic" music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center.
musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term "world music".
these critics, "world music" is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres.

recent years there has been an increased focus on measuring results of World Bank development assistance through impact evaluations.
evaluations demand a substantial amount of information, time and resources.
it is important to select carefully the public actions that will be evaluated.
the past 15 years, the World Bank's policy on disclosing information has evolved gradually.
now, the World Bank's approach has been to spell out what documents the World Bank discloses.

terms of assumption, Caufield first criticizes the highly homogenized and Western recipes of "development" held by the Bank.
the World Bank, different nations and regions are indistinguishable, and ready to receive the "uniform remedy of development".
second assumption is that poor countries cannot modernize without money and advice from abroad.
of the World Bank contend that no country is forced to borrow its money.
the loans are concessional since they are given to countries that have no access to international capital markets.
that cannot borrow in international markets in their own currency lack that power.

drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.
can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy.
dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires.
of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.
most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history occurred in the Atacama Desert in Chile (400 Years).
the tropics, distinct, wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone or Monsoon trough.
dry season greatly increases drought occurrence, and is characterized by its low humidity, with watering holes and rivers drying up.
of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common.
of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production, increase evaporation and transpiration from plants, and worsen drought conditions.
and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America during El Niño events.
are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana.
years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4 mm of rain fell.
can be the result of material movement by the wind.
wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation).
particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession).
is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment.
generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.
appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world.
deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily.
windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.
erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought.
with drought in some areas, flooding and erosion will increase in others.
a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases.
effects of droughts and water shortages can be divided into three groups: environmental, economic and social consequences.
economic and social consequences of a generation of tax cutting are clear.
example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources.
with populations that depend on water sources as a major food source are more vulnerable to famine.
can also reduce water quality, because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources.
is a normal, recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world.
2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers.
China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.
2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years.
far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback.
burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.
droughts leading to desertification in East Africa have created grave ecological catastrophes, prompting food shortages in 1984–85, 2006 and 2011.
agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds.
fund of about £20,000 was distributed to the drought-hit countries.
people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation.
to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities.

is one of two major branches of fusion energy research, the other being magnetic confinement fusion.
led to the design of newer machines, much larger, that would finally reach ignition energies.
similar large-scale device in France, Laser Mégajoule, was officially inaugurated in October 2014.
have started since then, albeit with low laser energies involved.
reactions combine lighter atoms, such as hydrogen, together to form larger ones.
are positively charged, and thus repel each other due to the electrostatic force.
this repulsion costs a considerable amount of energy, which is known as the "Coulomb barrier" or "fusion barrier energy".
best fuel from an energy perspective is a one-to-one mix of deuterium and tritium; both are heavy isotopes of hydrogen.
D-T (deuterium& tritium) mix has a low barrier because of its high ratio of neutrons to protons.
in the hot, dense center of the sun, the average proton will exist for billions of years before it fuses.
temperature and pressure required for any particular fuel to fuse is known as the Lawson criterion.
conditions have been known since the 1950s when the first H-bombs were built.
a hydrogen bomb, the fusion fuel is compressed and heated with a separate fission bomb (see Teller-Ulam design).
variety of mechanisms transfers the energy of the fission "trigger"'s explosion into the fusion fuel.
requirement of a fission bomb makes the method impractical for power generation.
the explosion size is scaled down, so too is the amount of energy needed to start the reaction off.
led to the idea of using a device that would "beam" the energy at the fusion fuel, ensuring mechanical separation.
the mid-1960s, it appeared that the laser would develop to the point where the required energy levels would be available.
density is not high enough to create any useful rate of fusion on its own.
additional energy will cause additional fusion reactions in the heated fuel, giving off more high-energy particles.
process spreads outward from the centre, leading to a kind of self-sustaining burn known as "ignition".
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is also formed during the process due to shock waves being formed.
are thus a debated feature even today; the equally numerous "direct-drive" design does not use them.
ion beams are particularly interesting for commercial generation, as they are easy to create, control, and focus.
confinement feasibility began in the mid-1950s by the inventor of modern television, Dr. Philo Farnsworth.
scant funding, he was successful in developing three generations of his "Fusor" tube.
the last several tests of this device, notable levels of excess output were produced.
were approved, and the science of this type of "inertial confinement" fusion is well documented.
it has been relatively dormant, it remains the first true experimentation into the concept.
resulting steam would then be used to power conventional generators, and thereby provide electrical power.
meeting led to the Operation Plowshare efforts, given this name in 1961.
was directly tested in December 1961 when the 3 kt Project Gnome device was emplaced in bedded salt in New Mexico.
shell provided the same effect as the bomb casing in an H-bomb, trapping x-rays inside so they irradiated the fuel.
power would be delivered by a then-unidentified pulsed power source he referred to using bomb terminology, the "primary".
main advantage to this scheme is the efficiency of the fusion process at high densities.
in theory, the ICF approach would be dramatically more efficient in terms of gain.
the ICF case, the entire hohlraum is filled with high-temperature radiation, limiting losses.
1964 Winterberg proposed that ignition could be achieved by an intense beam of microparticles accelerated to a velocity of 1000 km/s.
in 1968, he proposed to use intense electron and ion beams, generated by Marx generators, for the same purpose.
1967 research fellow Gurgen Askaryan published article with proposition to use focused laser beam in fusion lithium deuteride or deuterium.
early 1960 this produced a full simulation of the implosion of 1 mg of D-T fuel inside a dense shell.
simulations considered the timing of the energy delivered in the pulse, known as "pulse shaping", leading to better implosion.
the shell was made much larger and thinner, forming a thin shell as opposed to an almost solid ball.
two changes dramatically increased the efficiency of the implosion, and thereby greatly lowered the energy required to compress it.
introduction of the laser in 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories in California appeared to present a perfect driver mechanism.
the early 1970s he formed KMS Fusion to begin development of a laser-based ICF system.
opposition was funnelled through the Atomic Energy Commission, who demanded funding for their own efforts.
was, in particular, very well funded and started a major laser fusion development program.
Janus laser started operation in 1974, and validated the approach of using Nd:glass lasers to generate very high power devices.
problems were explored in the Long path laser and Cyclops laser, which led to the larger Argus laser.
this, Shiva succeeded and compressed its pellets to 100 times the liquid density of deuterium.
resulting design, now known as the National Ignition Facility, started construction at LLNL in 1997.
is still a long way from satisfying the Lawson criterion, but is a major step forward.
two types of fast ignition are the "plasma bore-through" method and the "cone-in-shell" method.
Mégajoule, the French project, has seen its first experimental line achieved in 2002, and was finally completed in 2014.
uses massive amounts of electric current which is switched into a cylinder comprising many of extremely fine wires.
faces continued technical challenges in reaching the conditions needed for ignition.
systems were initially believed to be able to generate commercially useful amounts of energy.
as estimates of the energy required to reach ignition grew dramatically during the 1970s and'80s, these hopes were abandoned.
sorts of gains appeared to be impossible to generate, and ICF work turned primarily to weapons research.
the recent introduction of fast ignition and similar approaches, things have changed dramatically.
this approach gains of 100 are predicted in the first experimental device, HiPER.
the same sorts of numbers in a reactor combining fast ignition with newer lasers would offer dramatically improved performance.
systems face some of the same secondary power extraction problems as magnetic systems in generating useful power from their reactions.
FLiBe is then passed into a heat exchanger where it heats water for use in the turbines.
Sombrero, uses a reaction chamber built of Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer which has a very low neutron cross section.
to better known units, this is the equivalent of 2.8 kWh of electrical power.
the time this objection was first noted, Nuckolls suggested using liquid droplets sprayed into the hohlraum from an eye-dropper-like apparatus.
systems avoid the use of a hohlraum and thereby may be less expensive in fuel terms.
these systems still require an ablator, and the accuracy and geometrical considerations are even more important.
are also far less developed than the indirect-drive systems, and face considerably more technical problems in terms of implosion physics.
there is no strong consensus whether a direct-drive system would actually be less expensive to operate.
the short term a number of new systems are expected to reach the second stage.
of the laser systems mentioned in this article have trouble operating even as much as once a day.
of the HiPER budget are dedicated to research in this direction as well.
is currently studying devices that operate at 1 MJ at 1 Hz, or alternately 100 kJ at 10 Hz.
knowledge and corporate expertise in the nuclear weapons program is another motivation for pursuing ICF.
countries have abandoned nuclear-weapons programs, recognizing that nothing good could possibly come from them.
Korea’s nuclear weapons program has been a matter of concern for two decades.
confinement fusion has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than spallation.
particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its variables at any given time.
with a single processor generally implement multithreading by time slicing: the central processing unit (CPU) switches between different "software threads".
context switching generally happens very often and rapidly enough that users perceive the threads or tasks as running in parallel.
computer programming, "single threading" is the processing of one command at a time.
is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process.
threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently.
should choose whether to share it, and they should be able to share it on their own terms.
threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution.
can also be applied to one process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.
multithreading, on the other hand, relies on the threads themselves to relinquish control once they are at a stopping point.
can create problems if a thread is waiting for a resource to become available.
can be done at the kernel level or user level, and multitasking can be done preemptively or cooperatively.
scheduling is typically uniformly done preemptively or, less commonly, cooperatively.
the user level a process such as a runtime system can itself schedule multiple threads of execution.
scheduled user threads are known as "fibers"; different processes may schedule user threads differently.
threads may be executed by kernel threads in various ways (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many).
term "light-weight process" variously refers to user threads or to kernel mechanisms for scheduling user threads onto kernel threads.
"process" is a "heavyweight" unit of kernel scheduling, as creating, destroying, and switching processes is relatively expensive.
include memory (for both code and data), file handles, sockets, device handles, windows, and a process control block.
or destroying a process is relatively expensive, as resources must be acquired or released.
multiple kernel threads can exist within a process, then they share the same memory and file resources.
threads are preemptively multitasked if the operating system's process scheduler is preemptive.
kernel threads take much longer than user threads to be swapped.
are sometimes implemented in userspace libraries, thus called "user threads".
kernel is unaware of them, so they are managed and scheduled in userspace.
implementations base their user threads on top of several kernel threads, to benefit from multi-processor machines (M:N model).
this article the term "thread" (without kernel or user qualifier) defaults to referring to kernel threads.
threads as implemented by virtual machines are also called green threads.
fiber can be scheduled to run in any thread in the same process.
programming environments such as OpenMP typically implement their tasks through fibers.
allows concurrently running code to couple tightly and conveniently exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an IPC.
caused by race conditions can be very difficult to reproduce and isolate.
prevent this, threading application programming interfaces (APIs) offer synchronization primitives such as mutexes to lock data structures against concurrent access.
uniprocessor systems, a thread running into a locked mutex must sleep and hence trigger a context switch.
multi-processor systems, the thread may instead poll the mutex in a spinlock.
scheduling occurs in userspace, the scheduling policy can be more easily tailored to the requirements of the program's workload.
the use of blocking system calls in user threads (as opposed to kernel threads) or fibers can be problematic.
typical example of this problem is when performing I/O: most programs are written to perform I/O synchronously.
the program can be written to avoid the use of synchronous I/O or other blocking system calls.
2.x+, and DragonFly BSD implement LWPs as kernel threads (1:1 model).
5.9 and later, as well as NetBSD 5 eliminated user threads support, returning to a 1:1 model.
6 supported both 1:1 and M:N, users could choose which one should be used with a given program using/etc/libmap.conf.
use of kernel threads simplifies user code by moving some of the most complex aspects of threading into the kernel.
program does not need to schedule threads or explicitly yield the processor.
code can be written in a familiar procedural style, including calls to blocking APIs, without starving other threads.
SMP systems, this is further exacerbated because kernel threads may literally execute on separate processors in parallel.
created by the user in a 1:1 correspondence with schedulable entities in the kernel are the simplest possible threading implementation.
approach is also used by Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OS X, and iOS.
GNU Portable Threads uses User-level threading, as does State Threads.
maps some M number of application threads onto some N number of kernel entities, or "virtual processors."
is a compromise between kernel-level ("1:1 ") and user-level ("N:1") threading.
can be implemented without operating system support, although some operating systems or libraries provide explicit support for them.
IBM Enterprise PL/I compiler introduced a new model "thread" API.
implementations of C and C++ support threading, and provide access to the native threading APIs of the operating system.
languages are designed for sequential parallelism instead (especially using GPUs), without requiring concurrency or threads (Ateji PX, CUDA).
limits performance mostly for processor-bound threads, which require the processor, and not much for I/O-bound or network-bound ones.
standardized interface for thread implementation is POSIX Threads (Pthreads), which is a set of C-function library calls.
Windows has its own set of thread functions in the process.h interface for multithreading, like beginthread.
provides yet another standardized interface over the host operating system using the Java concurrency library java.util.concurrent.
libraries provide a function call to create a new thread, which takes a function as a parameter.
concurrent thread is then created which starts running the passed function and ends when the function returns.
a new task arrives, it wakes up, completes the task and goes back to waiting.
example, frameworks like Grand Central Dispatch and Threading Building Blocks.
(771/775–839), also spelled Ecgberht, Ecgbert, or Ecgbriht, was King of Wessex from 802 until his death in 839.
829 Egbert defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove him out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly.
that year Egbert received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore.
"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" subsequently described Egbert as a "bretwalda", or "Ruler of Britain".
was unable to maintain this dominant position, and within a year Wiglaf regained the throne of Mercia.
continues back to Cerdic, founder of the House of Wessex.
descent from Ingild was accepted by Frank Stenton, but not the earlier genealogy back to Cerdic.
was believed at one time to also be the father of Saint Eadgyth of Polesworth and Æthelstan of Kent.
784 a new king of Kent, Ealhmund, appears in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle".
to a note in the margin,"this king Ealhmund was Egbert's father [i.e.
does not appear to have long survived in power: there is no record of his activities after 784.
succession was contested by Egbert, but he was defeated by Beorhtric, maybe with Offa's assistance.
"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" records that Egbert spent three years in Francia before he was king, exiled by Beorhtric and Offa.
either case Egbert was probably exiled in 789, when Beorhtric, his rival, married the daughter of Offa of Mercia.
to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Egbert learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.
dependency on Mercia continued into the reign of Cenwulf, who became king of Mercia a few months after Offa's death.
Hwicce were defeated, though Weohstan was killed as well as Æthelmund.
more is recorded of Egbert's relations with Mercia for more than twenty years after this battle.
battle marked the end of the Mercian domination of southern England.
Essex, Egbert expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown.
to this view, Beornwulf may have taken advantage of the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825.
consequences of Ellendun went beyond the immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast.
826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship.
was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason.
outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.
829 Egbert invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf, the king of Mercia, into exile.
victory gave Egbert control of the London Mint, and he issued coins as King of Mercia.
relevant part of the annal reads, in the [C] manuscript of the "Chronicle":
list is often thought to be incomplete, omitting as it does some dominant Mercian kings such as Penda and Offa.
of Wendover is known to have incorporated Northumbrian annals into his version; the "Chronicle" does not mention these events.
dominion over southern England came to an end with Wiglaf's recovery of power.
return is followed by evidence of his independence from Wessex.
may also have brought Essex back into the Mercian orbit during the years after he recovered the throne.
plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support.
support may have been one of the factors that helped Egbert achieve the military successes of the late 820s.
the loss of dominance, Egbert's military successes fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anglo-Saxon England.
winners and losers are clear, and the political landscape has changed profoundly.
victories marked the end of the independent existence of the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex.
conquered territories were administered as a subkingdom for a while, including Surrey and possibly Essex.
issued in Kent described Egbert and Æthelwulf as "kings of the West Saxons and also of the people of Kent."
details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names.
archbishop of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, also accepted Egbert and Æthelwulf as the lords and protectors of the monasteries under Ceolnoth's control.
was buried in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder.
unique feature of Australia's fauna is the relative scarcity of native placental mammals.
the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous extinctions.
examples include the paradise parrot, pig-footed bandicoot and the broad-faced potoroo.
geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia's fauna unique.
was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica.
establishment and evolution of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent.
Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects of global climate change.
change and global finance are not our only crises.
unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.
the Miocene, fauna of Asian origin were able to establish themselves in Australia.
marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present.
of the five living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna.
platypus—a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammal—is considered to be one of the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom.
has the world's largest and most diverse range of marsupials.
are characterised by the presence of a pouch in which they rear their young.

became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania.
are four species of quoll, or "native cat", all of which are threatened species.
rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.
are seven species in Australia, most of which are endangered.
evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, because they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.
marsupials are classified in the order Diprotodontia, and further into the suborders Vombatiformes and Phalangerida.
Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat.
of Australia's best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of eucalyptus.
on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on grasses, sedges and roots.
use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.
Phalangerida includes six families and 26 species of possum and three families with 53 species of macropod.
Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant material with their tails.
Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family.
human settlement many placental mammals have been introduced to Australia and are now feral.
evidence suggests that people from the north brought the dingo to Australia about 5000 years ago.
three species of placental mammal were not deliberately introduced to Australia, the house mouse, black rat and the brown rat.
marine mammals from the order Cetacea are found in Australian coastal waters.
the majority of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species.

has four families of native frogs and one introduced toad, the cane toad.
1935 the cane toad was introduced to Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops.
has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia.
notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree frog.
elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia's frog populations in recent years.
crocodiles, found only in northern Australia, are not considered dangerous to humans.

largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2 m in length.
than 5000 species of fish inhabit Australia's waterways; of these, 24% are endemic.
because of the relative scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only about 300 species of freshwater fish.
families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or bonytongues, and the Queensland lungfish.
Queensland lungfish is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana.
families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae.
species include freshwater lampreys, herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including the sleepy cod.
freshwater game fish include the barramundi, Murray cod, and golden perch.

mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish.
has been linked to declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species.
of Australia's fish species are marine, and 75% live in tropical marine environments.

crayfish genus "Cherax" includes the common yabby, in addition to the farmed species marron and Queensland red claw.
from the genus "Engaeus", commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia.
species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows.
has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus "Austrothelphusa".
crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought.
best-known class, to which all the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca.
peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia.
foxes affect local endemic fauna by predation while the cane toad poisons the predators by being eaten.
invasive species include birds (Indian mynah) and fish (common carp), insects (red imported fire ant) and molluscs (Asian mussel).
problem is compounded by invasive exotic flora as well as introduced diseases, fungi and parasites.

reactions fuse two lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.
current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement by laser.
approaches rely on other means of energy transfer, mostly that capture energy without relying on neutron capture.
nuclei lighter than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy.
nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an external source of energy.
nuclei smaller than iron-56 are more likely to fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.
of doing this include speeding up atoms in a particle accelerator, or heating them to high temperatures.
result is a hot cloud of ions and the electrons formerly attached to them.
the charges are separated, plasmas are electrically conductive and magnetically controllable.
fusion devices take advantage of this to control the particles as they are heated.
reaction's cross section, denoted σ, is the measure of the probability that a fusion reaction will happen.
sections for many fusion reactions were measured (mainly in the 1970s) using particle beams.
a plasma, particle velocity can be characterized using a probability distribution.
the plasma is thermalized, the distribution looks like a bell curve, or maxwellian distribution.
this case, it is useful to take the average cross section over the velocity distribution.
Lawson Criterion shows how energy varies with temperature, density, speed of collision and fuel.
equation was central to John Lawson's analysis of fusion working with a hot plasma.
Power = Efficiency* (Fusion- Radiation Loss- Conduction Loss)"
is energy that leaves the cloud as light in the visible, UV, IR, or X-ray spectra.
became known as the "triple product": the plasma density, temperature and confinement time.
to increase the triple product led to targeting larger plants.

out from the center of this ring, the magnetic field reverses direction.
drive:" In this technique, lasers directly blast a pellet of fuel.
first blast compresses the fusion fuel, while the second high energy pulse ignites it.
drive:" In this technique, lasers blasts a structure around the pellet of fuel.
it disintegrates the pellet is bathed in a more uniform x-ray light, creating better compression.
largest system using this method is the National Ignition Facility.
fusion " or"Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion:" This combines a laser pulse with a magnetic pinch.
pinch community refers to it as magnetized liner Inertial fusion while the ICF community refers to it as magneto-inertial fusion.
Ion Beams" There are also proposals to do inertial confinement fusion with ion beams instead of laser beams.
main difference is the mass of the beam has momentum, whereas lasers do not.
This method sends a current inside a plasma, in the theta direction.
Pinch:" This method combines a theta and z-pinch for improved stabilization.
This method uses an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions.
machine typically uses two spherical cages, a cathode inside the anode, inside a vacuum.
machines are not considered a viable approach to net power because of their high conduction and radiation losses.
are simple enough to build that amateurs have fused atoms using them.
This designs attempts to combine magnetic confinement with electrostatic fields, to avoid the conduction losses generated by the cage.
target fusion:" This method confines hot plasma using a magnetic field and squeezes it using inertia.
include LANL FRX-L machine, General Fusion and the plasma liner experiment.
Fusion has been initiated by man, using uncontrolled fission explosions to ignite so-called Hydrogen Bombs.
proposals for fusion power included using bombs to initiate reactions.
fusion:" A beam of high energy particles can be fired at another beam or target and fusion will occur.
was used in the 1970s and 1980s to study the cross sections of high energy fusion reactions.
fusion:" This is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature.
fusion is discredited and gained a reputation as pathological science.
fusion:" Muons allow atoms to get much closer and thus reduce the kinetic energy required to initiate fusion.
require more energy to produce than can be obtained from muon-catalysed fusion, making this approach impractical for power generation.
theoretical limit of power via this means is a type-2 civilization via a Dyson Sphere.
limits how much of these types of renewable power can usefully be fed into the world’s electricity grids.
then needs to be hot enough to start fusion reactions.
Heating" A radio wave is applied to the plasma, causing it to oscillate.
Heating" An electric field can do work on charged ions or electrons, heating them.
remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps.
light can be detected and used to reconstruct the plasmas'behavior.
technique can be used to find its density and temperature.
ICF systems, this can be done by firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target.
probe" This is a metal object placed in a plasma.
potential is applied to it, giving it a positive or negative voltage against the surrounding plasma.
IV-curve can be used to determine the local plasma density, potential and temperature.
counters record the rate of neutron production, so they are an essential tool for demonstrating success.

is the case of magnetized plasma, where the magnetic fields and plasma intermix.
general measure of magnetic trapping in fusion is the beta ratio:
is the ratio of the externally applied field to the internal pressure of the plasma.
Mirror" One example of magnetic confinement is with the magnetic mirror effect.
a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected.
the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape.
mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement.
the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.
confinement is the use of rapidly imploding shell to heat and confine plasma.
fusion using lasers would be done using tiny pellets of fuel that explode several times a second.
induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams.
beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy and light ion beams and electron beams have all been investigated.
ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process.
they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse.

1942, nuclear fusion research was subsumed into the Manhattan Project when the secrecy surrounding the field obscured by the science.
first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946 by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
is based on the fact that plasmas are electrically conducting.
a current through the plasma, will generate a magnetic field around the plasma.
plasmas generate denser magnetic fields, increasing the inward force, leading to a chain reaction.
the conditions are correct, this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion.
difficulty is getting the current into the plasma, which would normally melt any sort of mechanical electrode.
in 1947, two UK teams carried out small experiments and began building a series of ever-larger experiments.

led to the design of a second series of pinch machines, led by the UK ZETA and Sceptre devices.
on C slowed as attempts were made to correct for these problems.
invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted.
largest "classic" pinch device was the ZETA, including all of these suggested upgrades, starting operations in the UK in 1957.
physicists in the US expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed.
experiments soon demonstrated the same neutrons, although temperature measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions.

first controlled fusion experiment was accomplished using Scylla I at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1958.
was a pinch machine, with a cylinder full of deuterium.
and A.D. Sakharov in the Soviet Union, first discussed a tokamak-like approach.

reactions like the deuterium and Helium reaction or the Helium and Helium reactions, would require a supply of Helium.
can either come from other nuclear reactions or from extraterrestrial sources.
reaction is common in research, industrial and military applications, usually as a convenient source of neutrons.
is a naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen and is commonly available.
large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult uranium enrichment process.
the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the breeding of tritium from lithium using one of the following reactions:
reaction with Li is exothermic, providing a small energy gain for the reactor.
reaction with Li is endothermic but does not consume the neutron.
least some Li reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements.
reactor designs use the naturally occurring mix of lithium isotopes.
a production setting, the neutrons would be used to react with lithium in order to create more tritium.
also deposits the energy of the neutrons in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production.
lithium neutron absorption reaction protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux.
designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, also use lithium inside the reactor core as a key element of the design.
plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as "recycling".
advantage of this design was demonstrated in the Lithium Tokamak Experiment.
is the second easiest fusion reaction, fusing deuterium with itself.
reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:
optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15 keV, only slightly higher than the optimum for the D-T reaction.
complete removal of tritium and recycling of He, only 6% of the fusion energy is carried by neutrons.
second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining helium-3 (He) and deuterium (H):
reaction produces a helium-4 nucleus (He) and a high-energy proton.
reasonable assumptions, side reactions will result in about 0.1% of the fusion power being carried by neutrons.
power station using hot plasma, is going to have plasma facing walls.
even the simplest plasma approaches, the material will get blasted with matter and energy.
leads to a minimum list of considerations, including dealing with:
on the approach, these effects may be higher or lower than typical fission reactors like the pressurized water reactor (PWR).
need to be selected or developed that can withstand these basic conditions.
on the approach, however, there may be other considerations such as electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability and mechanical strength.
is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes.
even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite.
also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.
fusion reactors contain relatively small amounts of fuel, enough to "burn" for minutes, or in some cases, microseconds.
plasma is burnt at optimal conditions, and any significant change will quench the reactions.
reaction process is so delicate that this level of safety is inherent.
the fuel supply is closed, the reaction stops within seconds.
the magnetic approach, strong fields are developed in coils that are held in place mechanically by the reactor structure.
of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to "explode" outward.
laser-driven inertial approach is generally lower-stress because of the increased size of the reaction chamber.
failure of the reaction chamber is possible, simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure.
this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk.
likelihood of "small industrial" accidents including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff cannot be estimated yet.
would include accidental releases of lithium or tritium or mis-handling of decommissioned radioactive components of the reactor itself.
rarely a defect in the magnet can cause a quench.
pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction.
entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, depending on the size of the superconducting coil).
abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing.
damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.
practice, magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when the beginning of a quench is detected.
undesirable, a magnet quench is a "fairly routine event" during the operation of a particle accelerator.
natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of helium, which is completely harmless to life.
more concern is tritium, which, like other isotopes of hydrogen, is difficult to retain completely.
normal operation, some amount of tritium will be continually released.
ITER designs are investigating total containment facilities for any tritium.
large flux of high-energy neutrons in a reactor will make the structural materials radioactive.
radioactive inventory at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor, but there are important differences.
500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.
for example, would become much less radioactive than stainless steel.
fusion power uses nuclear technology, the overlap with nuclear weapons would be limited.
and thermal power production (turbine based) are most comparable to fission power from an engineering and economics viewpoint.
fusion power is still in early stages of development, substantial sums have been and continue to be invested in research.
aspect of fusion energy is that the cost of production does not suffer from diseconomies of scale.
example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis.
scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization.
and later Demo are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear fusion energy reactor by 2050.
power could be used in interstellar space, where solar energy is not available.
German insider joke is to call that effect Fusionskonstante ("fusion constant", similar as in oil constant).
the very start, fusion power projects involved various cost overruns and missed deadlines.
example, the construction of the National Ignition Facility cost $5 billion and took seven years longer than expected.

gap existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines.
9 and 11 November, Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men escaped into the jungle to the south.
12 November, the Americans completely overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left in the pocket.
American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation.
acting on a recommendation by Turner, had approved the Aola Bay airfield construction effort.
Aola airfield construction effort was later abandoned at the end of November because of unsuitable terrain.
Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700 to 800 survivors were still with him.
of the survivors from Shōji's force joined other Japanese units defending the Mount Austen and upper Matanikau River area.
Americans and Japanese remained facing each other along a line just west of Point Cruz for the next six weeks.
IJA requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support the next offensive.
also provided a warship support force that included two battleships.
warship force was commanded from "Hiei" by recently promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe.
early November, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field.
reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approach of Abe's bombardment force and passed a warning to the Allied command.
force comprised two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers.
01:30 on 13 November, Callaghan's force intercepted Abe's bombardment group between Guadalcanal and Savo Island.
addition to the two battleships, Abe's force included one light cruiser and 11 destroyers.
the pitch darkness, the two warship forces intermingled before opening fire at unusually close quarters.
Japanese destroyers were sunk and another destroyer and "Hiei" heavily damaged.
spite of his defeat of Callaghan's force, Abe ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field.
bombardment caused some damage but failed to put the airfield or most of its aircraft out of operation.
of the troops were rescued from the transports by Tanaka's escorting destroyers and returned to the Shortlands.
dark, Tanaka and the remaining four transports continued towards Guadalcanal as Kondo's force approached to bombard Henderson Field.
force consisted of "Kirishima" plus two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers.
the two forces made contact, Kondo's force quickly sank three of the U.S. destroyers and heavily damaged the fourth.
Japanese warships then sighted, opened fire, and damaged "South Dakota".
fruitlessly chasing "Washington" towards the Russell Islands, Kondo ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field.
Kondo's ships retired, the four Japanese transports beached themselves near Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal at 04:00 and quickly began unloading.
26 November, Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the newly formed Eighth Area Army at Rabaul.
new command encompassed both Hyakutake's 17th Army and the 18th Army in New Guinea.
of Imamura's first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal.
Allied offensive at Buna in New Guinea, however, changed Imamura's priorities.
Japanese continued to experience problems in delivering sufficient supplies to sustain their troops on Guadalcanal.
to use only submarines the last two weeks in November failed to provide sufficient food for Hyakutake's forces.
26 November, the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced a food crisis.
front-line units had not been resupplied for six days and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations.
situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies.
Fleet personnel devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal.
unit was centered on eight destroyers, with six destroyers assigned to carry between 200 and 240 drums of supplies apiece.
additional destroyers joined Wright's force en route to Guadalcanal from Espiritu Santo during the day of 30 November.
22:40 on 30 November, Tanaka's force arrived off Guadalcanal and prepared to unload the supply barrels.
Wright's warships were approaching through Ironbottom Sound from the opposite direction.
destroyers detected Tanaka's force on radar and the destroyer commander requested permission to attack with torpedoes.
waited four minutes before giving permission, allowing Tanaka's force to escape from an optimum firing setup.
the same time, Wright's cruisers opened fire, quickly hitting and destroying one of the Japanese guard destroyers.
rest of Tanaka's destroyers escaped without damage, but failed to deliver any of the provisions to Guadalcanal.
7 December 1942, Hyakutake's forces were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks.
12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned.
the delegation's return to Tokyo, Sanada recommended that Guadalcanal be abandoned.
28 December, General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano personally informed Emperor Hirohito of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal.
corps consisted of the 2nd Marine Division and the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry and 23rd "Americal" Divisions.
18 December, Allied (mainly U.S. Army) forces began attacking Japanese positions on Mount Austen.
some difficulty, the Allies captured all three by 23 January.
the same time, U.S. Marines advanced along the north coast of the island, making significant gains.
staff officer from Rabaul accompanied the troops to notify Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw.
intelligence detected the Japanese movements, but misinterpreted them as preparations for another attempt to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal.
29 January, Halsey, acting on the same intelligence, sent a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal screened by a cruiser task force.
Japanese and Americans each lost a destroyer from air and naval attacks related to the evacuation mission.
from some air attacks, Allied forces, still anticipating a large Japanese offensive, did not attempt to interdict Hashimoto's evacuation runs.
9 February, Patch realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure for Allied forces, ending the campaign.
naval port and logistics facilities were established at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida.
anchorage around Tulagi became an important advanced base for Allied warships and transport ships supporting the Solomon Islands campaign.
ground units were staged through large encampments and barracks on Guadalcanal before deployment further up the Solomons.
Guadalcanal the Japanese were clearly on the defensive in the Pacific.
Allies had gained a strategic initiative which they never relinquished.
campaigns were battles that strained the logistical capabilities of the combatant nations involved.
the U.S., this need prompted the development of effective combat air transport for the first time.
failure to achieve air superiority forced Japan to rely on reinforcement by barges, destroyers, and submarines, with very uneven results.
spelled trouble for Japan as its military-industrial complex was unable to match the output of American industry and manpower.
Guadalcanal campaign was costly to Japan strategically and in material losses and manpower.
30,000 personnel, including 25,000 experienced ground troops, died during the campaign.
many as three-quarters of the deaths were from non-combat causes such as starvation and various tropical diseases.
drain on resources directly contributed to Japan's failure to achieve its objectives in the New Guinea campaign.
also lost control of the southern Solomons and the ability to interdict Allied shipping to Australia.
major base at Rabaul was now further directly threatened by Allied air power.
importantly, scarce Japanese land, air, and naval forces had disappeared forever into the Guadalcanal jungle and surrounding sea.
the victory at the Battle of Midway, America was able to establish naval parity in the Pacific.
this fact alone did not change the direction of the war.
Guadalcanal Campaign ended all Japanese expansion attempts and placed the Allies in a position of clear supremacy.
as important as the military victory for the Allies was the psychological victory.
victory by either the Brotherhood or the military would not be a victory for democracy.
a level playing field, the Allies had beaten Japan's best land, air, and naval forces.
Guadalcanal, Allied personnel regarded the Japanese military with much less fear and awe than previously.
addition, the Allies viewed the eventual outcome of the Pacific War with greatly increased optimism.
Guadalcanal Campaign was the subject of large amount of high quality news reporting.
agencies sent some of their most talented writers, as it was the first major US combat operation of the war.
Tregaskis who wrote for International News Service gained fame with the publication of his bestselling "Guadalcanal Diary" in 1943.
GDR functioned nominally as a multi-party state with the SED playing a central role.
party's dominant figure from 1950 to 1971, and effective leader of East Germany, was Walter Ulbricht.
SED's long-suppressed reform wing took over the party in the fall of 1989.
received 16.4% of the vote in the 1990 parliamentary elections.
East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties.
there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed.
all accounts, the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's eastern branch to merge with the KPD.
these elections were held under less-than-secret conditions, thus setting the tone for the next four decades.
that contest, the SED received less than half the votes of the SPD.
bulk of the Berlin SPD remained aloof from the merger, even though Berlin was deep inside the Soviet zone.
problem for the Soviets that they identified with the early SED was its potential to develop into a nationalist party.
it was nominally a merger of equals, from the beginning the SED was dominated by Communists.
the late 1940s, the SED began to purge most recalcitrant Social Democrats from its ranks.
began to develop along lines similar to other Communist parties in the Soviet bloc.
the years, the SED gained a reputation as one of the most hardline parties in the Soviet bloc.
Mikhail Gorbachev initiated reforms in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the SED held to an orthodox line.
party organisation was based on, and co-located with, the institutions of the German Democratic Republic.
influence stood behind and shaped every facet of public life.
smallest organisational unit in the party was the Party Group.
members elected one of their number Party Group Organiser (PGO), to take responsibility for Party Work.
choreography was carefully undertaken to ensure that they were understood as high-profile society events.
were selected from the regional and sectional party organisations according to criteria determined by the Party Central Committee.
was taken over the proportions of women, of youth representatives, of members from approved and of "exemplary" workers.
usually held their offices on an unsalaried basis, often combining their party secretarial duties with a salaried function.
task of the Party Secretaries was the organisation of political work.
prepared the party meetings and organised political training in partnership with the party leaderships.
capturing the leadership of a political party is still easier than being elected US President.
ensured implementation of and compliance with party decisions, and undertook general reporting and leadership duties.
work on occasion attracted criticism, there were many ways on which changes could be passed on.
fact lay behind the burgeoning bureaucratization of the party apparatus and the presence of Stalinistic tendencies.
secretaries underwent a special monthly political process that included instructive guidance and verification by representatives from higher level party committees.
meant that a manager, provided he was a party member, was committed to implementing those decisions.
basic organisional unit in an organisation or department was placed under the control of the party's sectional leadership team ("SED-Kreisleitung").
regional party leadership team ("SED Bezirksleitung"/ BL) was an elected body, membership of which was unpaid.
worked alongside the administrative body of paid officials who were occasionally also members of the party leadership team.
when the Party Congress was in session, the Party Central Committee was the party's leading element.
General Secretary until 1971 was Walter Ulbricht: he was succeeded by Erich Honecker.
the political hierarchy of the German Democratic Republic members of the Central Committee ranked above government ministers.
years on, there was little sign of the KPD/SPD parity that had been invoked when the SED was created.
1989 membership of the Central Committee had increased to 165: there were also 57 people listed as candidates for membership.
Party Central Committee, reflecting the country's overall power structure, was overwhelmingly male: the proportion of women never rose above 15%.
General Secretary of the Central Committee also held the Chairmanship of the Politburo (along with all his other functions).
country's government, formally headed by the Council of Ministers, was required only to implement the decisions of the politburo.
chairmen of the Council of Ministers and the president of the National legislature "("Volkskammer ")" were also members of the politburo.
Secretariat played a decisive role in selecting the Nomenklatura of the Central Committee.
1st Party Congress "(Vereinigungsparteitag)", which convened on 21 April 1946, was the unification congress.
union was initially intended to apply to the whole of occupied Germany.
union was rejected consistently in the three western occupation zones, where both parties remained independent.
union of the two parties was thus effective only in the Soviet zone.
SED was modeled after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
1946, the unification was announced in the Soviet occupation zone with an emblem of a handshake.
adopted a fresh party statute and transformed the party executive committee into a central committee "(Zentralkomitee" or "ZK").
3rd Party Congress convened in July 1950 and emphasized industrial progress.
congress approved a new party program and a new party membership statute.
new economic policy was introduced, more strongly centralized- the "New Economic System".
Secretary Walter Ulbricht announced the "ten requirements of the socialist moral and ethics".
the about-face in economic policy that year cannot be attributed to Honecker's advancement alone.
the previous two winters, the GDR had been plagued with power shortages and traffic breakdowns.
congresses the Central Committee could convene a party conference to resolve policy and personnel issues.
9th Party Congress in May 1976 can be viewed as a midpoint in the development of SED policy and programs.
congress also highlighted the fact that East Germany had achieved international recognition in the intervening years.
Germany's growing involvement in both the East European economic system and the global economy reflected its new international status.
international status and the country's improved diplomatic and political standing were the major areas stressed by this congress.
major point of emphasis at the congress was the issue of inter-German détente.
in the past, Honecker stressed the importance of the ties to the Soviet Union.
his closing remarks, he stated: "Our party, the SED, is linked forever with the party of Lenin, [the CPSU]."
Germany's successes, presented as a personal triumph for Honecker, marked a crowning point in his political career.
Gorbachev's presence at the congress endorsed Honecker's policy course, which was also strengthened by some reshuffling of the party leadership.
praised the East German experience as proof that central planning could be effective and workable in the 1980s.
defense of his policy of "constructive dialogue" appeared in tune with Gorbachev's own calls for disarmament and détente in Europe.
a result of Soviet pressure, such statements disappeared from East German commentary on foreign policy.
rest of October saw widespread protests across the country, including in East Berlin and Leipzig.
tried to portray himself as a reformer, but few believed him.
he could not (or would not) satisfy the growing demands of the people for increased freedom.
of the regime's efforts to stem the tide ended up being its death knell.
was widely interpreted as a decision to open the Berlin Wall.
of East Berliners crowded at the Wall, demanding to be let through.
and unwilling to use force, the guards were quickly overwhelmed and let them through the gates to West Berlin.
3 December 1989, the entire Central Committee and "Politbüro"—including Krenz—resigned.
after the SED abandoned power, Gregor Gysi, a reformist, was elected to the new post of party chairman.
also declared that the party needed to adopt a new form of socialism.
the time of a special 16 December congress, the SED was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party.
distance itself from its repressive past, the party added "Party of Democratic Socialism" (PDS) to its name.
4 February 1990, what remained of the party was renamed solely as the PDS.
SED had sequestered money overseas in secret accounts, including some which turned up in Liechtenstein in 2008.
was returned to the German government, as the PDS had rejected claims to overseas SED assets in 1990.
vast majority of domestic SED assets were transferred to the GDR government before unification.
was represented in the Bundestag without interruption until 2007, and eventually began growing again.

non-linear editing method is similar in concept to the "cut and paste" techniques used in film editing or in IT.
with the use of non-linear editing systems, the destructive act of cutting of film negatives is eliminated.
and audio data are first captured to video servers, other hard disk-based systems, or other digital storage devices.
data are either direct to disk recording or are imported from another source (transcoding, digitizing, transfer).
non-linear editing, the original source files are not lost or modified during editing.
is one of the biggest advantages of non-linear editing compared to linear editing.
editing software records the editor's decisions in an edit decision list (EDL) that is exportable to other editing tools.
generations and variations of the original source files can exist without storing many different copies, allowing for very flexible editing.

approximations of non-linear editing systems were built in the'80s using computers coordinating multiple laser discs, or banks of VCRs.
most popular non-linear system was Ediflex, which used a bank of multiple Sony JVC VCRs for offline editing.
was introduced in 1983 on the Universal series "Still the Beaver," edited by Herb Dow, A.C.E.
1985 it was used on over 80% of filmed network programs.
1985 Cinedco was awarded the Technical Emmy for"Design and Implementation of Non-Linear Editing for Filmed Programs.
used 17 identical copies of a set of film rushes on modified consumer Betamax VCRs.
custom circuit board was added to each deck that enabled frame-accurate switching and playback using vertical interval timecode.
the play list could be done easily, and the results seen immediately.
Montage system generated significant interest and systems were installed in several post-production houses, primarily in Manhattan and LA.
first feature edited on the Montage was Sidney Lumet's "Power".
Francis Coppola edited "Godfather III" on the system, and Stanley Kubrick used it for "Full Metal Jacket".
was used on several episodic TV shows ("Knott's Landing", for one) and on hundreds of commercials and music videos.
original system won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1988.
handbook has remained in print since 1991, currently in its 4th edition (Triad, 2000)
it was more of a video effects system, it had some non-linear editing capabilities.
was sufficient, however, to provide a versatile system for offline editing, to revolutionize video and film editing.
NewTek Video Toaster Flyer for the Amiga included non-linear editing capabilities in addition to processing live video signals.
Flyer used hard drives to store video clips and audio, and supported complex scripted playback.
of these SCSI buses were used to store video data, and the third to store audio.
1993, the Avid Media Composer was most often used for editing commercials or other small content/high value projects.
until 1992, the Apple Macintosh computers could access only 50 gigabytes of storage at once.
instant access to the shot footage of an entire movie, long form non-linear editing (Motion Picture Editing) was now possible.
M-JPEG became the standard codec for NLE during the early 1990s, it had drawbacks.
high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards.
importantly, the traditional tape workflow had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility.
the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them.
tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these fixed disks.
issues were addressed by a small UK company, Eidos plc.
software could decode multiple video and audio streams at once for real-time effects at no extra cost.
most significantly, for the first time, it supported unlimited cheap removable storage.
aim was to'democratize'the desktop and take some of Avid's market.
August 1993, Media 100 entered the market, providing would-be editors with a low-cost, high-quality platform.
the same period, two other competitors provided non-linear systems that required special hardware—typically cards added to the computer system.
the period after 1998, the United States provided almost the entire required deficit.
Video Cube was also a contender for media production companies.
Translation's Media 100 came with three different JPEG codecs for different types of graphics of video and many resolutions.
Media 100 system kept increasing its maximum video resolution via software upgrades rather than hardware.
was forced to continually offer lower-priced systems to compete with the Media 100 and other systems.
raising support and money for development led the team to take their non-linear editor to the NAB conference.
around the same time, Avid—now with Windows versions of its editing software—was considering abandoning the Macintosh platform.
leap came in the late 1990s with the launch of DV-based video formats for consumer and professional use.
DV came IEEE 1394 (FireWire/iLink), a simple and inexpensive way of getting video into and out of computers.
this innovation, editing became a more realistic proposition for standard computers with software-only packages.
enabled real desktop editing producing high-quality results at a fraction of the cost of other systems.
Cut Pro received a Technology& Engineering Emmy Award in 2002 and continues to develop a following.
three competing products by Avid, Adobe, and Apple are the foremost NLEs, often referred to as the A-Team.
advances in raw computer processing power, new products have appeared including NewTek's software application SpeedEdit.
2000, many personal computers include basic non-linear video editing software free of charge.
one time, a primary concern with non-linear editing had been picture and sound quality.
limitations at the time required that all material undergo lossy compression techniques to reduce the amount of memory occupied.
professional NLEs are also able to edit uncompressed video with the appropriate hardware.

October 26, 1944 he was captured in Milan, along with others, at the Christian Democrats'secret headquarters in Milan.
was decorated by the United States with the Silver Star.
instead, worked hard to restructure the company and transform it into one of the nation's most important economic assets.
obtained an exclusive concession for gas and oil exploration within the national territory, and was able to retain the profits.

three men on board were killed: Mattei, his pilot Irnerio Bertuzzi, and the American Time–Life Journalist William McHale.
Italian Minister of Defense, Giulio Andreotti, was responsible for the accident investigation.
his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had made many enemies.
U.S. National Security Council described him as an irritation and an obstacle in a classified report from 1958.
French could not forgive him for doing business with the pro-independence movement in Algeria.

on this evidence the episode was reclassified by the judge as homicide, but with perpetrator(s) unknown.
Mattei is a controversial figure in Italian 20th century history.
made ENI a powerful company, so much so that Italians dub it "the state within the state."
doubts about his possible murder, however, are more compelling than the theory of a technical accident.

concept of "development" rests on the assumption that Modernization theory holds.
short, it argues that there is only one way to achieve "modernity" and "development"- that of "Western" nation-states.
challenged today, modernization theory still holds an important role in defining "development".
such cases, the term "developing country" may be considered a euphemism.
term also implies homogeneity within such countries when wealth (and health) of the most and least affluent groups varies widely.
the term "developed country" incorrectly implies a lack of continuing economic development/growth in more-developed countries.

2015 review states that paracetamol remains a first-line recommended medication for pain and fever during pregnancy, despite these concerns.
date, the mechanism of action of paracetamol is not completely understood.
main mechanism proposed is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), and recent findings suggest that it is highly selective for COX-2.
of its selectivity for COX-2, it does not significantly inhibit the production of the pro-clotting thromboxanes.
conclusion has been contested in a new hypothesis paper on how paracetamol might act.
reduces the oxidised form of the COX enzyme, preventing it from forming pro-inflammatory chemicals.
leads to a reduced amount of "prostaglandin E2" in the CNS, thus lowering the hypothalamic set-point in the thermoregulatory centre.
is now clear that paracetamol acts via at least two pathways.
exact mechanisms by which COX is inhibited in various circumstances are still a subject of discussion.
theory holds that paracetamol works by inhibiting the COX-3 isoform—a COX-1 splice variant—of the COX family of enzymes.
inhibiting anandamide reuptake, levels in the synapse remain high and are able to desensitise the TRPV1 receptor much like capsaicin.
TRPA1 receptors have also been demonstrated to mediate antinociceptive effects of paracetamol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in mice.
4 hours the concentration is usually less than 10 µg/mL, which equals 66 µmol/L.
is metabolised primarily in the liver, into toxic and non-toxic products.
three pathways yield final products that are inactive, non-toxic, and eventually excreted by the kidneys.
the third pathway, however, the intermediate product NAPQI is toxic.
is primarily responsible for the toxic effects of paracetamol; this constitutes an example of toxication.
of NAPQI is due primarily to two isoenzymes of cytochrome P450: CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.
usual doses, NAPQI is quickly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione.
presence of two activating groups also make the benzene ring highly reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution.
is not considered an NSAID because it does not exhibit significant anti-inflammatory activity (it is a weak COX inhibitor).

acid, to form an indophenol dye under oxidization by air.
its unacceptable toxic effects, the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, prompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives.
1893, von Mering published a paper reporting on the clinical results of paracetamol with phenacetin, another aniline derivative.
Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol had a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia.
sales of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company.
is the active metabolite of phenacetin and acetanilide, both once popular as analgesics and antipyretics in their own right.
unlike phenacetin, acetanilide and their combinations, paracetamol is not considered carcinogenic at therapeutic doses.
also suggested that methemoglobinemia is produced in humans mainly by another metabolite, phenylhydroxylamine.
follow-up paper by Brodie and Axelrod in 1949 established that phenacetin was also metabolised to paracetamol.
was first marketed in the United States in 1950 under the name Triagesic, a combination of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine.
1955, paracetamol was marketed as Children's Tylenol Elixir by McNeil Laboratories.

without a prescription since 1959, it has since become a common household drug.
on paracetamol have long expired, and generic versions of the drug are widely available.
acetaminophen and paracetamol come from a chemical name for the compound: "para"-acetylaminophenol and "para"-acetylaminophenol.
is available in a tablet, capsule, liquid suspension, suppository, intravenous, intramuscular and effervescent form.
some formulations, paracetamol is combined with the opioid codeine, sometimes referred to as co-codamol (BAN) and Panadeine in Australia.

May 1992, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 was announced as a winner on performance and cost grounds.
Finnish Minister of Defence, Elisabeth Rehn stated that delays in Gripen's development schedule had hurt its chances in the competition.

Bomb Unit 15 is an unpowered, glide weapon used to destroy high-value enemy targets.
was designed for use with F-15E Strike Eagle, F-111'Aardvark'and F-4 Phantom II aircraft.
GBU-15 has long-range maritime anti-ship capability with the B-52 Stratofortress.
weapon has five components—a forward guidance section, warhead adapter section, control module, airfoil components, and a weapon data link.
external electrical conduit extends the length of the warhead which attaches the guidance adapter and control unit.
conduit carries electrical signals between the guidance and control sections.
GBU-15 may be used in either a direct or an indirect attack.
weapon automatically guides itself to the target, enabling the pilot to leave the area.
an indirect attack, the weapon is guided by remote control after launch.
pilot releases the weapon and, via remote control, searches for the target.
highly maneuverable weapon has an optimal, low-to-medium altitude delivery capability with pinpoint accuracy.

manufacturing techniques and new products or product improvements are usually embodied in new machines and skills.
GBU-8 could not be controlled after the bomb was released.
the aircraft was forced to fly very close to the target so the WSO could acquire it.
locked on, the weapon could be released and the aircraft could return to base.
GBU-15 with television guidance, completed full-scale operational test and evaluation in November 1983.
February 1985, initial operational test and evaluation was completed on the imaging infrared guidance seeker.

important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s.
vehemently believed that a photograph was equivalent to the visual record of a chemistry experiment.
a good part of the nineteenth century was spent debating which of these directions was the medium's true function."
recently historians have recognized that pictorialism is more than just a visual style.
writer has noted that pictorialism was "simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style."
to the development of photography, a painted miniature portrait was the most common means of recording a person's likeness.
photography quickly negated the need for and interest in miniature portraits.
photography continued to develop, the interactions between painting and photography became increasingly reciprocal.
developments led to pictorialism being "a more international movement in photography than almost any other photographic genre."
1888 George Eastman introduced the first handheld amateur camera, the Kodak camera.
was marketed with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest."
the camera and prints were returned to the customer, who was ready to take more pictures.

a word, photography is what the photographer makes it‒ an art or a trade."

photographers and art critics, including Oscar Rejlander, Marcus Aurelius Root, John Ruskin, echoed these ideas.
was for, all intents and purposes, a simple record of the visual facts, lacking artistic intent or merit.
have slipped into the Temple of Art by a back door, and found ourselves amongst the crowd of adepts."
of the challenges in promoting photography as art was that there were many different opinions about how art should look.
some photographers saw themselves becoming true artists by emulating painting, at least one school of painting directly inspired photographers.
the 1880s, when debates over art and photography were becoming commonplace, a style of painting known as Tonalism first appeared.
a few years it became a significant artistic influence on the development of pictorialism.
dimness of outline which is characteristic for distant objects is due to atmosphere.
what atmosphere is to Nature, tone is to a picture."
could only be done by creating a mark of individuality for each image and, ideally, each print.
of the strongest voices that championed pictorialism at its beginning were a new generation of amateur photographers.
contrast to its meaning today, the word "amateur" held a different connotation in the discussions of that time.
the 1893 Hamburg International Photographic Exhibition in Germany, only the work of amateurs was allowed.
should show originality, imagination, unity of purpose, a quality of repose, and have an infinite quality about it"
Spain pictorial photographers were sometimes called "interventionists" ("intervencionistas "), although the style itself was not known as"interventionism".
evolution of pictorialism from the 19th century well into the 1940s was both slow and determined.
its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. and the rest of the world in several semi-distinct stages.
to 1890 pictorialism emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France.
the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz's multi-faceted efforts.
1900 pictorialism had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.
dozens of countries around the world, the AIDS epidemic threatens every aspect of development.
regularly featured articles from influential foreign photographers such as Alfred Stieglitz and Robert Demachy.
in other countries, opposing viewpoints engaged a wider range of photographers in defining what pictorialism meant.
in Canada initially centered on Sidney Carter (1880–1956), the first of his countrymen to be elected to the Photo-Secession.
1907 Carter organized Canada's first major exhibition of pictorial photography at Montreal's Art Association.
The Linked Ring was at the forefront of the movement to have photography regarded as an art form.
1910 The Linked Ring has dissolved, and its members went their own way.
in France is dominated by two names, Constant Puyo and Robert Demachy.
brothers Theodor and Oskar Hofmeister of Hamburg were among the first to advocate for photography as art in their country.
Karl Maria Udo Remmes represents the style of pictorialism in the field of theatrical backstage photography.
new group promoted their own concepts of what they called "the inner truth" of art photography.
the next decade many photographers aligned themselves with one of these two organizations.
the 1920s new organizations were formed that bridged the transition between pictorialism and modernism.
prominently among these was the Shashin Geijustu-sha (Photographic Art Society) formed by Shinzō Fukuhara and his brother Rosō Fukuhara.
first generation of Dutch pictorialists, including Bram Loman, Chris Schuver and Carl Emile Mögle, began working around 1890.
second generation of Dutch pictorialists included Henri Berssenbrugge, Bernard Eilers and Berend Zweers.
included Aleksei Mazuin, Sergei Lobovikov, Piotr Klepikov, Vassily Ulitin, Nikolai Andreev, Nikolai Svishchov-Paola, Leonid Shokin and Alexander Grinberg.
were the primary promoters of pictorialsim in Russia for many years.
main centers of pictorial photography in Spain were Madrid and Barcelona.
in the footsteps of German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the Photo-Secession in New York.
hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it.
much initially centered on Stieglitz, pictorialism in the U.S. was not limited to New York.
Boston F. Holland Day was one of the most prolific and noted pictorialists of his time.
H. White, who produced extraordinary pictorial photographs while in Ohio, went on to teach a whole new generation of photographers.
photographers began by taking an ordinary glass-plate or film negative.
following is a list of the most commonly used pictorial processes.
details about these processes may be found in Crawford (pp 85‒95) and in Daum (pp 332‒334).
otherwise noted, the descriptions below are summarized from these two books.

the trader was able in 2005 to buy the stock almost instantly and got it at a cheaper price.
ones are formed, while existing ones are bought or merged.
of the end of 2006, the most important ECNs to the individual trader were:
combination of factors has made day trading in stocks and stock derivatives (such as ETFs) possible.
low commission rates allow an individual or small firm to make a large number of trades during a single day.
liquidity and small spreads provided by ECNs allow an individual to make near-instantaneous trades and to get favorable pricing.
1997 to 2000, the NASDAQ rose from 1200 to 5000.
forex trading became a popular way to day trade due to its liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the market.
following are several basic strategies by which day traders attempt to make profits.
is important for a trader to remain flexible and adjust their techniques to match changing market conditions.
Securities and Exchange Commission removed the uptick requirement for short sales on July 6, 2007.
investing is a market timing strategy used in all trading time-frames.
assumes that financial instruments which have been rising steadily will reverse and start to fall, and vice versa.
is, every time the stock hits a high, it falls back to the low, and vice versa.
a stock is said to be "trading in a range", which is the opposite of trending.
is a trading style where small price gaps created by the bid-ask spread are exploited by the speculator.
normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds.
highly liquid instruments for off-the-floor day traders involves taking quick profits while minimizing risk (loss exposure).
basic idea of scalping is to exploit the inefficiency of the market when volatility increases and the trading range expands.
stock values suddenly rise, they short sell securities that seem overvalued.
trading is an equity trading style that uses ECN rebates as a primary source of profit and revenue.
events provide enormous volatility in a stock and therefore the greatest chance for quick profits (or losses).
things simple can also be an effective methodology when it comes to trading.
estimated one third of stock trades in 2005 in United States were generated by automatic algorithms, or high-frequency trading.
increased use of algorithms and quantitative techniques has led to more competition and smaller profits.
average commission per trade is roughly $5 per round trip (getting in and out of a position).
scalper can cover such costs with even a minimal gain.
numerical difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the bid-ask spread.
spread can be viewed as trading bonuses or costs according to different parties and different strategies.
one hand, traders who do NOT wish to queue their order, instead paying the market price, pay the spreads (costs).
the other hand, traders who wish to queue and wait for execution receive the spreads (bonuses).
day trading strategies attempt to capture the spread as additional, or even the only, profits for successful trades.
fees may be waived for promotional purposes or for customers meeting a minimum monthly volume of trades.
a moderately active day trader can expect to meet these requirements, making the basic data feed essentially "free".
types of systems can cost from tens to hundreds of dollars per month to access.
is important to note that this requirement is only for day traders using a margin account.
domestic pigeon was originally bred from the wild rock dove, which naturally inhabits sea-cliffs and mountains.
(i.e.,'wild'), domestic, and feral pigeons are all the same species and will readily interbreed.
evidence suggests that wild, domestic and feral pigeons mate for life, although their long-term bonds are not unbreakable.
are socially monogamous, but extra-pair matings do occur, often initiated by males.
rituals can be observed in urban parks at any time of the year.
first, the female invariably walks or flies a short distance away and the male follows her until she stops.
this point, he continues the bowing motion and very often makes full- or half-pirouettes in front of the female.
male then proceeds to feed the female by regurgitating food, as they do when feeding the young.
male then mounts the female, rearing backwards to be able to join their cloacae.
mating is very brief with the male flapping his wings to maintain balance on top of the female.
nesting is common as pigeons are a community flocking bird; often, dozens of birds share a building.
and droppings tend to stay clustered and remain dry when out of the weather.
popularity of a nesting area does not seem to be affected by the pigeons'population density.
also coo, but this is noticeably less guttural than the cooing of the cock.
is also more frequent between couples during mating and nesting.
of eggs can take place up to six times per year.
is not legal to kill/destroy nests for any other reason other than those listed under the general licences.
example, the breeding population of feral pigeons in Sheffield, England, has been estimated at only 12,130 individuals.
is rare that a pigeon will transmit a disease to humans due to their immune system.
one’s immune system weakens, the disease may erupt.
lab has been working on bird flu since the 1970s.
birds got 100 to 1,000 times the concentration that wild birds would encounter in nature.
bacteria "Chlamydophila psittaci" is endemic among pigeons and causes psittacosis in humans.
is transmitted both from handling pigeons but mostly from their droppings.
is a serious disease but rarely fatal (less than 1%).
are also important vectors for different species of the bacteria "Salmonella", which causes diseases as salmonellosis and paratyphoid fever.
often cause significant pollution with their droppings, though there is little evidence of them driving out other bird species.
are labeled an invasive species in North America by the USDA.
addition, pigeon populations may be reduced by bird control systems that successfully reduce nesting sites.
birds of prey occasionally take advantage of this population as well.
Wrexham, Wales, a pair of peregrine falcons has nested since 2002.
to their non-selective nature, most avian poisons have been banned.
the United States market only 4-aminopyridine (Avitrol) and DRC-1339 remained registered by EPA.
is limited to USDA use only while 4-AP is a restricted use pesticide, for use only by licensed applicators.
pigeons are poisoned, surviving birds do not leave the area.
the contrary, they are left with more food per bird than before.
attracts pigeons from outside areas as well as encouraging more breeding, and populations are re-established quickly.
to this, in cities with peregrine falcon programs it is typically illegal to poison pigeons.
more effective tactic to reduce the number of feral pigeons is deprivation.
however, will still pick at garbage bags containing discarded food or at leftovers carelessly dropped on the ground.
developed for use in resident Canada geese, nicarbazin was introduced for use as a contraceptive for feral pigeons in 2007.
active ingredient, nicarbazin, interferes with the viability of eggs by binding the ZP-3 sperm receptor site in the egg.
"OvoControl P", brand of nicarbazin, is increasingly used in urban areas and industrial sites to control pigeon populations.
egg nesting programs have therefore been tested in some cities with mixed results.
children display severe psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, seizures, and muscle spasticity or hypotonia.
symptoms of the disorder may include unusual facial appearance, difficulty swallowing, and anomalies of the hands, fingers, or toes.
to this time, the fetal brain normally has a smooth appearance.
lissencephaly is suspected, chorionic villus sampling can test for some lissencephaly variants, but only those with a known genetic mutation.
counseling is usually offered if there is a risk of lissencephaly, coupled with genetic testing.
spectrum of lissencephaly is only now becoming more defined as neuroimaging and genetics have provided more insights into migration disorders.
are around 20 types of lissencephaly which make up the spectrum.
causes which have not yet been identified are likely as well.
types of lissencephaly are described below (OMIM numbers are included where available):
for those with lissencephaly is symptomatic and depends on the severity and locations of the brain malformations.
care may be needed to help with comfort and nursing needs.
may be controlled with medication and hydrocephalus may require shunting.
prognosis for children with lissencephaly varies depending on the malformation.
individuals remain in a 3–5 month developmental level, while others may appear to have near normal intelligence and development.
children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially.
and respiratory disease are the most common causes of illness or death.
diseases are projected to become the most common causes of death by 2030.
the past, life expectancy was said to be around two years of age.
with advances in seizure control, and treatments for respiratory illness, most children live well beyond that age.
is the primary benchmark, along with the Euribor, for short-term interest rates around the world.
financial institutions, mortgage lenders and credit card agencies set their own rates relative to it.
least $350 trillion in derivatives and other financial products are tied to the Libor.
institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs after implementation of the recommended reforms.
UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.
British government regulates Libor through criminal and regulatory laws passed by the Parliament.
of this standard included the fixing of BBA interest-settlement rates, the predecessor of BBA Libor.
2 September 1985, the BBAIRS terms became standard market practice.
Libor fixings did not commence officially before 1 January 1986.
that date, however, some rates were fixed for a trial period commencing in December 1984.
banks for example currently contribute to the fixing of US Dollar Libor.
Libor is widely used as a reference rate for many financial instruments in both financial markets and commercial fields.
municipalities also borrowed around 75 percent of their money through financial products that were linked to the Libor.
the UK, the three-month British pound Libor is used for some mortgages—especially for those with adverse credit history.
Swiss franc Libor is also used by the Swiss National Bank as their reference rate for monetary policy.
euro Libor does exist, but mainly, for continuity purposes in swap contracts dating back to pre-EMU times.
Libor is an estimate and is not intended in the binding contracts of a company.
is calculated by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and published by Thomson Reuters.
were the US dollar, British pound sterling and the Deutschemark.
pound fell against the dollar, then the dollar against the pound.
a number of these currencies in 2000 merged into the euro there remained ten currencies.
reforms of 2013 Libor rates are calculated for 5 currencies.
that the Euro LIBOR should not be confused with EURIBOR.
1998, the shortest duration rate was one month, after which the rate for one week was added.
are four money markets in the world having interbank offered rate fixings in USD, including:
USD Libor in London is the most recognised and predominant one.
USD Sibor was established in January 1988, and the USD Hibor was launched in December 2006.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Eurodollar contracts are based on three-month US dollar Libor rates.
are the world's most heavily traded short-term interest rate futures contracts and extend up to ten years.
rate swaps based on short Libor rates currently trade on the interbank market for maturities up to 50 years.
under-reporting could have created an impression that banks could borrow from other banks more cheaply than they could in reality.
former Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, later used the same description before the Treasury Select Committee.
a case would be very difficult because determining the Libor rate does not occur on an open exchange.
to people familiar with the situation, subpoenas have been issued to the three banks.
reports on this have since come from the BBC and Reuters.
28 November 2012, the Finance Committee of the Bundestag held a hearing to learn more about the issue.
UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.
28 February 2012, it was revealed that the US Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation into Libor abuse.
2 July 2012, Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, resigned from the position following the interest rate rigging scandal.
Diamond, the chief executive officer of Barclays, resigned on 3 July 2012.
Agius will fill his post until a replacement is found.
del Missier, chief operating officer of Barclays, also resigned, as a casualty of the scandal.
Missier subsequently admitted that he had instructed his subordinates to submit falsified LIBORs to the British Bankers Association.
senators said that an American-based interest rate index is a better alternative which they would take steps towards creating.
administration of Libor has itself become a regulated activity overseen by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.
Danish, Swedish, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Libor rates have been terminated.
example, each bank must now have a named person responsible for Libor, accountable if there is any wrongdoing.
banks must keep records so that they can be audited by the regulators if necessary.
early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of Libor from the British Bankers Association.
new administrator was NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited, a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.
13 November 2013, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) Group announced the successful completion of its acquisition of NYSE Euronext.
a result of this acquisition, NYSE Euronext Rate Administration Limited was renamed ICE Benchmark Administration Limited.
appointment of a new administrator is a major step forward in the reform of LIBOR.
scandal also led to the European Commission proposal of EU-wide benchmark regulation, that may affect Libor as well.
Command is a 1980 arcade game by Atari, Inc. that was also licensed to Sega for European release.
a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed.
weapons are only able to destroy three cities during one level.
level ends when all enemy weaponry is destroyed or reaches its target.
player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level.
the conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for any remaining cities or unused missiles.
game, then, is just a contest in seeing how long the player can survive.
some later stage the speed of missiles increases greatly for a few screens.
the 255th and 256th yellow screens, known as the 0x stages, the scoring increases by 256 times the base value.
good players these two 0x stages could earn over a million points.
this way it was possible to play this game for hours on end.
programming "Missile Command", the programmer, Dave Theurer, suffered from nightmares of these cities being destroyed by a nuclear blast.
Command" is considered one of the great classic video games from the Golden Age of Arcade Games.
game's instruction manual describes a war between two planets: Zardon (the defending player) and Krytol.
Command" was also ported to Atari's line of 8-bit computers.
the 1990s, "Missile Command" was ported to handheld systems such as the Atari Lynx and Game Boy.
was released as part of the original Microsoft Arcade for the PC in 1993.
is the only game that works with the virtual reality helmet from Virtuality (only 2 pieces are known to exist).
this version, the players must prevent missiles from destroying the different cities in Australia, Antarctica, Peru, and Africa.
protecting the cities on each level, the players must destroy each of the spaceships responsible.
Command" was released via Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 on July 4, 2007.
September 23, 2008, "Missile Command" was released for the iPhone and iPod touch though the App Store for US$5.
1981, an enhancement kit was made by General Computer Corp. to convert "Missile Command" into "Super Missile Attack".
made the game even harder, and added a UFO to the player's enemies.
1992, Atari developed a prototype of an arcade game called "Arcade Classics" for their 20th anniversary.
game included "Missile Command 2" and "Super Centipede" (an updated version of the original "Centipede").
released an online multi-player game inspired by the original version, in 2010.
types of world record are monitored for the arcade version of "Missile Command": Marathon settings and Tournament settings.
settings allow the player to start with a full complement of six cities.
settings give the player additional bonus cities, typically at every 10,000 points scored.
of this, seasoned players can play the game, in theory, indefinitely.
the game to go on indefinitely, you must maintain the trust of the other players.
players will play until their game ends– either due to the game ending, fatigue or mechanical breakdown.
1981, Floridian Jody Bowles played a "Missile Command" arcade game for 30 hours at The Filling Station Eatery in Pensacola.
record was broken when Victor Ali of the USA scored 80,364,995 points in 1982.
is believed Ali played the game continuously for 56 hours.
streaming the world record attempt live on TwitchTV, his viewers confirmed that the new record indeed seemed rather unbeatable.
score of 1,967,830 points beat the record previously held by US gamer Roy Shildt for more than 20 years.
there is no killscreen on "Missile Command:" the game continues until the player loses their last city.
nearest rival, Jeffrey Blair, posted a score of 1,874,925 also in 2010.
January 11, 2011, 20th Century Fox announced that it had acquired the rights to bring "Missile Command" to film.
inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia.
four species that have been evaluated (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and mountain tapir) are all classified as endangered or vulnerable.
closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, which include horses, donkeys, zebras and rhinoceroses.
are in Central and South America whilst the fifth is in Asia.
have a single pair of mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.
often exhibit the flehmen response, a posture in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents.
response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in oestrus in the area.
length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest.
incisors are chisel-shaped, with the third large, conical upper incisor separated by a short gap from the considerably smaller canine.
much longer gap is found between the canines and premolars, the first of which may be absent.
are lophodonts, and their cheek teeth have distinct lophs (ridges) between protocones, paracones, metacones and hypocones.
exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma.
the tapir's sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.
have simple stomachs and are hindgut fermenters that ferment digested food in a large cecum.
tapirs reach sexual maturity between three and five years of age, with females maturing earlier than males.
natural lifespan of a tapir is about 25 to 30 years, both in the wild and in zoos.
from mothers and their young offspring, tapirs lead almost exclusively solitary lives.
with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.
the wild, the tapir's diet consists of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender growth.
will spend many of their waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts to the ground in search of food.
tapirs have been observed to eat around 40 kg (85 lb) of vegetation in one day.
may occur in or out of water, and in captivity, mating pairs will often copulate multiple times during oestrus.
first tapirids, such as "Heptodon", appeared in the early Eocene of North America.
appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis.
the Miocene, such genera as "Miotapirus" were almost indistinguishable from the extant species.
merriami ","T. veroensis ","T. copei ", and"T. californicus" became extinct during the Pleistocene in North America.
giant tapir "Megatapirus" survived until about 4,000 years ago in China.
pinchaque " arises from within a paraphyletic complex of"T. terrestris" populations.
tapir may have evolved from the paleothere "Hyracotherium" (once thought to be a primitive horse).
of genetic diversity in tapir populations has become a major source of concern for conservationists.
populations are another major potential source of development financing.
loss has isolated already small populations of wild tapirs, putting each group in greater danger of dying out completely.
in zoos, genetic diversity is limited; all captive mountain tapirs, for example, are descended from only two founder individuals.
number of conservation projects have been started around the world.
Baird's Tapir Project of Costa Rica is the longest ongoing tapir project in the world, having started in 1994.
involves placing radio collars on tapirs in Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park to study their social systems and habitat preferences.
are generally shy, but when scared they can defend themselves with their very powerful jaws.
tapir's two-month-old baby also occupied the cage at the time.)
Zoo pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety regulations and were ordered to pay €5,000 to charity.
Buck wrote about an attack by a tapir in 1926, which he described in his book, "Bring'Em Back Alive".
feature of this mythical creature is a snout like that of an elephant.
Chinese and Japanese folklore, tapirs, like their chimerical counterpart, are thought to eat people's nightmares.
the prehistoric sequences of the science fiction film, tapirs appear alongside primitive hominids in Africa.
(Dick) Mulcahy was born in Manor Street, Waterford in 1886.
was educated at Mount Sion Christian Brothers School and later in Thurles, County Tipperary, where his father was the postmaster.

his release Mulcahy immediately rejoined the republican movement and became commandant of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers.
March 1919 he became IRA chief of staff, a position he held until January 1922.
and Michael Collins were largely responsible for directing the military campaign against the British during the War of Independence.

earned notoriety through his order that anti-Treaty activists captured carrying arms were liable for execution.
total of 77 anti-Treaty prisoners were executed by the Provisional Government.
re-entered the cabinet as Minister for Local Government and Public Health in 1927.
his period on the backbenches of Dáil Éireann his electoral record fluctuated.
was elected as TD (Teachta Dála) for Dublin North-West in the 1921 and 1922 general elections.
again in the election of 1943, he secured election to the 4th Seanad, on the Labour Panel.
F. O'Higgins was parliamentary leader of the party in the Dáil at the time.
was returned again to the 12th Dáil as TD for Tipperary at the 1944 general election.
was faced with the task of reviving a party that had been out of office since 1932.
the 1948 general election, Fianna Fáil finished six seats short of a majority.
initially had the inside track to becoming Taoiseach in such a government.
he was not acceptable to Clann na Poblachta's leader, Seán MacBride.
Irish Republicans had never forgiven him for his role in the Civil War executions carried out under the Cosgrave government.
to Mulcahy, it was Labour leader William Norton who suggested another person as Taoiseach.
stepped aside and encouraged his party colleague Attorney General John A. Costello to take the post of Taoiseach.
then on, Costello served as parliamentary leader of Fine Gael while Mulcahy remained nominal leader of the party.
has also served as a leader of the Saenuri Party (formerly known as the Grand National Party).
went on to serve as Minister for Education from 1948 until 1951.

Mulcahy died in Dublin on 16 December 1971, at the age of 85 from natural causes.
relations is a multidisciplinary field that studies the employment relationship.
some authors now define human resource management as synonymous with employee relations.
authors see employee relations as dealing only with non-unionized workers, whereas labor relations is seen as dealing with unionized workers.
relations studies examine various employment situations, not just ones with a unionized workforce.
it is generally a separate field of study only in English-speaking countries, having no direct equivalent in continental Europe.
relations has three faces: science building, problem solving, and ethical.
nature of these institutional interventions, however, differ between two camps within industrial relations.
contrast, the Marxist-inspired critical camp sees employer-employee conflicts of interest as sharply antagonistic and deeply embedded in the socio-political-economic system.
society wrestled with these massive economic and social changes, labor problems arose.
the long run, economic and social change may help to resolve the situation.
scholarly pioneer in industrial relations and labor research was Robert F. Hoxie.
Britain, another progressive industrialist, Montague Burton, endowed chairs in industrial relations at Leeds, Cardiff and Cambridge in 1930.
World War II these were suppressed by the arbitration powers of the National War Labor Board.
most known of these was the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, founded in 1945.
included the Yale Labor and Management Center, directed by E. Wight Bakke, which began in 1945.
influential industrial relations scholar in the 1940s and 1950s was Neil W. Chamberlain at Yale and Columbia Universities.
discipline was formalized in the 1950s with the formation of the Oxford School by Allan Flanders and Hugh Clegg.
relations scholars have described three major theoretical perspectives or frameworks, that contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relations.
three views are generally known as unitarism, pluralist and radical.
theories are strongly identified with Marxist theories, although they are not limited to these.
particular, the two predominant sub-groups in the pluralist perspective are the management and trade unions.
the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more toward persuasion and co-ordination.
unitarism has a paternalistic approach: it demands loyalty of all employees and is managerial in its emphasis and application.
perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system.
is therefore seen as inevitable and trade unions are a natural response of workers to their exploitation by capital.
practice, labor unions are declining and fewer companies have industrial relations functions.
importance of work, however, is stronger than ever, and the lessons of industrial relations remain vital.
challenge for industrial relations is to re-establish these connections with the broader academic, policy, and business worlds.

Civil Rights Digital Library at the University of Georgia contains the following account of the closing of his restaurant:
his ownership of the Pickrick, Maddox, a Democrat, failed in two bids for mayor of Atlanta.
1957, he lost to incumbent William B. Hartsfield, for whom the large airport is named.
1961, Maddox lost to Ivan Allen, Jr., with whom he split the white vote.

unidentified Republican viewed Maddox's appeal as follows:"We have a populist revolution in its truest sense moving here.
" magazine termed Maddox a"strident racist ";"Newsweek " viewed him as a"backwoods demagogue out in the boondocks."
Maddox sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1966, his principal primary opponent was former Governor Ellis Arnall.
was no Republican primary at the time, but there were a great many voters who identified with the GOP.
the primary, Arnall won a plurality of the popular vote, but he was denied the required majority.
Senator Jimmy Carter, later the U.S. President, finished in a strong third place.
barely campaigned in the runoff, and Maddox emerged victorious, 443,055 to 373,004.
winning the runoff, the Baptist Maddox, who neither smoked nor drank alcohol, decreed God as his "campaign manager".

therefore waged his second bid for lieutenant governor, the first having resulted in defeat to Peter Zack Geer in 1962.
and Maddox found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.
after that election, Maddox appeared as a guest on "The Dick Cavett Show" on December 18, 1970.

called the campaign against Busbee "the worst thing I have ever been involved in."
called Maddox "a counterfeit conservative" and challenged the outgoing lieutenant governor to a debate.
former chief of staff Zell Miller was successful in his own bid to succeed Maddox as lieutenant governor.
remark was similar to a statement once uttered by Barry Goldwater about U.S. President Richard M. Nixon.
Maddox stated his intention to run for the seat if McDonald's wife, Kathy McDonald, did not.
Kathy McDonald decided to run, and Maddox stayed out of the race; however, she lost to Democrat George "Buddy" Darden.

was originally introduced in May 1978, for the 1979 model year.
its predecessor the 99, the 900 contained a number of unusual design features that distinguish it from most other cars.
the engine was installed "backwards", with power delivered from the crank at the front of the car.
over several decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900's double wishbone suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel.
rear suspension comprised a typical beam axle design, stabilized with a Panhard rod.
sway bars decreased body roll, but at the expense of some ride comfort and when driven aggressively, increased inside wheelspin.
front and rear bars'diameters were unchanged throughout the model's run.
900 utilized a deeply curved front windshield, providing the best driver visibility, calling attention to the marque's aircraft legacy.
is why, for example, the oft-used radio is placed so high in the dashboard.
of these features could, of course, be ordered independently from Saab's Accessories Catalog for fitment to standard models.
desirable UK option at this time was the fitment of very distinctive Minilite alloy wheels.
Gilbert claimed a million miles out of the turbocharging unit in addition to the engine itself.
only bodywork originally available was the three or five-door hatchback style, which was seen as more modern at the time.
Turbo had a different grille from the naturally aspirated models, which received a design with a hexagonal central element.
the 1980 model year, all versions received the sleeker turbo-style grille.
1980 900 also received larger taillights rather than the earlier 99 units, as well as lower, adjustable headrests up front.
was also the first year for a five-speed gearbox, originally only available in the EMS and the Turbo.
900 sedan was introduced in Geneva 1980, as a result of dealer pressure.
introduction corresponded with the phase-out of the old Saab B engine in favor of the lighter Saab H engine.

plant in Arlöv (now closed), near Malmö, also produced some 900s.
big change for 1982 was the introduction of Saab's Automatic Performance Control (APC), a.k.a.

the base 900 had the single-carburetor engine, while the 900i added fuel injection.
turbocharged models were offered: The 900 Turbo had the 8-valve engine, while the T16S had the 16-valve intercooled unit.
8-valve turbo had the intercooler the next year, while the 16-valve cars had hydraulic engine mounts.

pinion bearings were fitted to manual gearboxes for 1989 to improve their strength and reliability.

the churches that observe it, the Assumption is a major feast day, commonly celebrated on 15 August.

a later tradition, Mary drops her girdle down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event.
incident is depicted in many later paintings of the Assumption.

IBM 1401 was a variable wordlength decimal computer that was announced by IBM on October 5, 1959.
12,000 units were produced and many were leased or resold after they were replaced with newer technology.
late 1961, the 2000 installed in the USA were about one quarter of all electronic stored-program computers by all manufacturers.
number of installed 1401s peaked above 10,000 in the mid-1960s.
all, by the mid-1960s nearly half of all computer systems in the world were 1401-type systems."
it happens, nearly every system in the world is composed of such layers.
such installations, with an IBM 7090 for example, the mainframe computers used only magnetic tape for input-output.
allowed the mainframe's throughput to not be limited by the speed of a card reader or printer.
the 1970s, IBM installed many 1401s in India and Pakistan where they were in use well into the 1980s.
of today's Indian and Pakistani software entrepreneurs started on these 1401s.
first computer in Pakistan, for example, was a 1401 installed at Pakistan International Airlines.
alphanumeric character in the 1401 was encoded by six bits, called "B,A,8,4,2,1".
called the 1401's character code BCD, even though that term describes only the decimal digit encoding.
1401's alphanumeric collating sequence was compatible with the punched card collating sequence.
with each memory location were two other bits, called "C" for odd parity check and "M" for word mark.
1401 was available in six memory configurations: 1400, 2000, 4000, 8000, 12000, or 16000 characters.
very small number of 1401s were expanded to 32,000 characters by special request.
operations used specific memory locations (those locations were not reserved and could be used for other purposes).
a card" stored the 80 columns of data from a card into memory locations 001-080.
registers 1, 2 and 3 were in memory locations 087-089, 092-094 and 097-099 respectively.
a card" punched the contents of memory locations 101-180 into a card.
addresses ("I " a branch target,"A " and"B" data) and unit address were three characters.
length was then 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 characters.
three character memory address in an instruction was an encoding of a five digit memory address.
referenced by the A-address and B-address were: a single memory location, a variable length field, or a variable length record.
only limit on the length of such fields was the available memory.
or more adjacent variable length fields could make up a variable length record.
instruction "Move Characters Record or Group Mark" could be used to assemble a block of records.
example, addition of adjacent data fields might be coded as "A 700,850", "A 695,845", "A 690,840".
chaining, this could be coded as "A 700,850", "A", "A"- omitting data address from the 2nd and 3rd instructions.
Tom Van Vleck's web site here is a one-card program which will print "HELLO WORLD".
LOAD (above) begins execution at location 001 (the first ",").
SMS cards were inserted in sockets on hinged swing out racks, that IBM referred to as "gates".
most machines of the day, the 1401 used magnetic-core memory.
cores were about 1 mm in diameter and used a four-wire arrangement (x, y, sense, and inhibit).
stack of eight such planes stored the six data bits, word mark bit, and parity bit for 4000 memory locations.
with eight additional planes with fewer cores on them for additional storage functions, this made up a 4000-character memory module.
such module could be housed within the 1401's primary enclosure.
were commonly available with two, three, or four such modules.
instruction timings were cited in multiples of this cycle time.
the IBM Catalog of 1401 software, see IBM 1400 series.
of the instructions, Branch on Indicator (B) and Select Stacker (K), use a "modifier" operand.
B opcode, if followed by a three-character operand, was a simple unconditional branch to the indicated address.
a fourth operand character was present (making five characters total including the opcode), this made it a conditional branch.

1861, the United States fragmented due to growing questions of states'rights concerning issues of slavery, money, agriculture, and representation.
February of that year, a peace conference was held in Washington, DC.
armed peace has held for a year. But an armed peace never lasts.
Carolina sent five delegates to this conference, including Chief Justice Thomas Ruffin of the town of Haw River.
on, President Buchanan said that if Ruffin had persisted, the war might have been averted.
March, 1861, Alamance County residents voted overwhelmingly against North Carolina's secession from the Union, 1,114 to 254.
North Carolina was reluctant to join other Southern states in secession from the United States.

working under Annibale at the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese would be highly influential in Roman painting for decades.
Carracci was born in Bologna, and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family.
eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the Baroque Emilian or Bolognese School.
many early Bolognese works by the Carraccis, it is difficult to distinguish the individual contributions made by each.
large corporations, it is often difficult to ascertain the contribution of any individual.
1585, Annibale completed an altarpiece of the "Baptism of Christ" for the church of Santi Gregorio e Siro in Bologna.
1587, he painted the "Assumption" for the church of San Rocco in Reggio Emilia.
1587–88, Annibale is known to have had travelled to Parma and then Venice, where he joined his brother Agostino.
1589 to 1592, the three Carracci brothers completed the frescoes on the "Founding of Rome" for Palazzo Magnani in Bologna.
1592, he painted an "Assumption" for the Bonasoni chapel in San Francesco.
1593-94, all three Carraccis were working on frescoes in Palazzo Sampieri in Bologna.
the 17th and 18th centuries, the Farnese Ceiling was considered the unrivaled masterpiece of fresco painting for its age.
thus viewed the "Caravaggisti" styles with the same gloomy dismay.
were urged to depict the Platonic ideal of beauty, not Roman street-walkers.
Carracci and Caravaggio patrons and pupils did not all fall into irreconcilable camps.
patrons, such as Marquess Vincenzo Giustiniani, found both applied showed excellence in "maniera" and "modeling".
almost never worked in fresco, regarded as the test of a great painter's mettle.
thematic choice suggests Carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of Caravaggio's canvases.
is instructive to compare Carracci's "Assumption" with Caravaggio's "Death of the Virgin".
July 8, 1595, Annibale completed the painting of "San Rocco distributing alms", now in Dresden Gemäldegalerie.
significant late works painted by Carracci in Rome include "Domine, Quo Vadis?"
was remarkably eclectic in thematic, painting landscapes, genre scenes, and portraits, including a series of autoportraits across the ages.
is described by biographers as inattentive to dress, obsessed with work: his self-portraits vary in his depiction.
is not clear how much work Annibale completed after finishing the major gallery in the Palazzo Farnese.
1607, Annibale is unable to complete a commission for the Duke of Modena of a "Nativity".
is little documentation from the man or time to explain why his brush was stilled.
1609, Annibale died and was buried, according to his wish, near Raphael in the Pantheon of Rome.
is a measure of his achievement that artists as diverse as Bernini, Poussin, and Rubens praised his work.
paintings of Annibale are inspired by the Venetian pictorial taste and especially the paintings of Paolo Veronese.
economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.
1988 book "If Women Counted" is often regarded as the "founding document" of the discipline.
the 1990s feminist economics had become recognised as an established field within economics.
on, feminist ethicists, economists, political scientists, and systems scientists argued that women's traditional work (e.g.
teaching) are systematically undervalued with respect to that of men.
constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force.
this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve."
evidence illuminated the negative outcomes that these changes had for women.
the foreword to the 2014 anthology "", Julie A. Nelson wrote:
in other disciplines, the initial emphasis of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches.
idea is contrary to the typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners.
Diana Strassmann comments,"All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition.
this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics.
economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled."
economists call attention to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.
and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.
economists may also consider the specific gendered effects of trade-decisions.
women suffered significantly from the transition away from subsistence food production towards specialization and trade."
economics call attention to the importance of non-market activities, such as childcare and domestic work, to economic development.
stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as "non-economic" phenomena.
such labor in economic accounts removes substantial gender bias because women disproportionately perform those tasks.
account for half of the global labor supply and about 70% of the world’s consumption demand.
that labor is unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women is ignored, literally devaluing their effort.
this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis.
indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.
McKay argues for a basic income as "a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights" partially to address these concerns.
example, in"neoclassical texts, the sale of labor is viewed as a mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties.
mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee."
economics argue that gender and race must be considered in economic analysis.
models can often be improved by explicitly considering gender, race, class, and caste.
July 2002 issue of the "Feminist Economics" journal was dedicated to issues of "gender, color, caste and class."
other cases gender differences have been exaggerated, potentially encouraging unjustified stereotyping.
the studies that fail to find "difference" are less likely to be published or highlighted.
this view, people are considered rational actors who engage in marginal analysis to make many or all of their decisions.
feminist economists like Nancy Folbre show that cooperation also plays a role in the economy.
economists also point out that agency is not available to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly.
for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well.
feminist economists critique the focus of neoclassical economics on monetary rewards.
Folbre notes, "legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women."
economics is one means by which feminist economists improve upon the "homo economicus" model.
provides a more holistic view of the economic actor than "homo economicus."
economists often say such an approach assures objectivity and separates economics from "softer" fields such as sociology and political science.
feminist economists often call for more diverse data collection and broader economic models.
economists suggest that both the content and teaching style of economics courses would benefit from certain changes.
recommend including experimental learning, laboratory sessions, individual research and more chances to "do economics."
critiques of economics include that "economics, like any science, is socially constructed."
economists show that social constructs act to privilege male-identified, western, and heterosexual interpretations of economics.
economists often make a critical distinction that masculine bias in economics is primarily a result of gender, not sex.
the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.
feminist economists claim that the historical bases of economics are inherently exclusionary to women.
to feminist economics is an effort to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity.
macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more.
the 1960's the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war.
stimulus is turning into fiscal austerity and a drag on growth.
disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender.
approach demonstrates the effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models.
fails to account for the fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women.
show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.
model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living.
refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.
approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being.
recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).
to feminist economics is a different approach to the "family" and "household."
classical economics, those units are typically described as amicable and homogeneous.
models, according to feminist economists, "endorsed traditional expectations about the sexes," and applied individualistic rational-choice models to explain home behavior.
feminist economists move beyond unitary household models and game theory to show the diversity of household experiences.
example, Bina Agarwal and others have critiqued the mainstream model and helped provide a better understanding of intra-household bargaining power.
shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families.
Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining.
feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.
argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work.
have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.
highlights the sustaining nature of care services offered outwith the formal economy.
economists have also highlighted power and inequality issues within families and households.
Sarah Gammage examines the effects of unpaid care work performed by women in Guatemala.
much care work is performed in the home, it may also be done for pay.
work can include domestic work, care work, subsistence work, unpaid market labor and voluntary work.
is no clear consensus on the definition of these categories.
broadly speaking, these kinds of work can be seen as contributing to the reproduction of society.
work is maintenance of the home, and is usually universally recognizable, e.g.
included in this category is "self-care," in which leisure time and activities are included.
work is usually work done for non-household members, but in return for little to no remuneration.
SNA recognizes that unpaid work is an area of interest, but "unpaid household services are excluded from [its] production boundary."
economists have criticized the SNA for this exclusion, because by leaving out unpaid work, basic and necessary labor is ignored.
accounting measures intended to recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring unpaid work.
feminist economics calls for a more comprehensive index which includes participation in unpaid work.
goal was restated at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.
to gather this data include surveys, in-depth interviews, diaries, and participant observation.
first problem of measuring unpaid work is the issue of collecting accurate information.
is always a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work.
such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies.
it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work.
data gathering involves difficulties with the potential inaccuracy of research subjects'reports.
time can also be problematic because "the slowest and most inefficient workers [appear to carry] the greatest workload."
use in assessing childcare is criticized as"easily obscur[ing] gender differences in workload.
standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt.
diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns."
have also been criticized for lacking "depth and complexity" as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.
across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature."
surveys may be the only way to get necessary information desired, but they make it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons.
lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example.
increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations.
still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres.
are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles.
third problem is the complexity of domestic labor and the issues of separating unpaid work categories.
use studies now take multitasking issues into account, separating primary and secondary activities.
mentioned above, child supervision (indirect care work) may not be construed as an activity at all, which
that activity-based surveys should be supplemented by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities" as otherwise such activities can be undercounted.
method extrapolates from the opportunity cost idea in mainstream economics.
looks at both the costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household.
remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor."
criticism of time valuation concerns the choice of monetary levels.
should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced?
issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products.
related argument is that the market"accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic.
this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination."
is also the issue of whether any enjoyment of the activity should be deducted from the opportunity cost estimate.
example, should childcare activities "be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?"
they assert that economic models must take these typically exogenous variables into account.
feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization.
other cases, feminist economists work on removing gender biases from the theoretical bases of globalization itself.
suggests that feminists critique such narratives by showing how a "global economy" is highly complex, de-centered and unclear.
feminist economists challenge the perception that only "objective" (often presumed to be quantitative) data are valid.
example, Lourdes Beneria argues that judgments about policies leading to greater well-being should be central to economic analysis.
feminist economists use country-level or smaller case studies focused on developing and often understudied countries or populations.
studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations.
economists see such variation as a crucial factor to be included in economics.
economists call for a shift in how economic success is measured.
feminist economists do not universally agree on the use of the GDI and some offer improvements to it.

Kalmyks (Kalmyk: Хальмгуд, "Khal’mgud", Mongolian: Халимаг, "Khalimag") are the Oirats in Russia, whose ancestors migrated from Dzungaria in 1607.
created the Kalmyk Khanate in 1630–1724 in Russia's North Caucasus territory.
they form a majority in the autonomous republic of Kalmykia on the western shore of the Caspian Sea.
emigration, small Kalmyk communities have been established in the United States, France, Germany, and the Czech Republic.
Kalmyk are a branch of the Oirats, Mongols whose ancient grazing-lands spanned present-day parts of Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia and China.
400 years the Oirats conducted a military struggle for domination and control over both Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia.
the start of this 400-year era, the Western Mongols designated themselves as the Four Oirat.
alliance comprised four major Western Mongol tribes: Khoshut, Choros, Torghut and Dörbet.
the Four Oirat sought power as an alternative to the Mongols, who were the patrilineal heirs to Genghis Khan.
tribes belonging to the confederation included the Khoits, Zakhchin, Bayids and Mangits.
pitched their yurts and kept herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, horses, donkeys and camels.
Four Oirat was a political entity formed by the four major Oirat tribes.
reestablished their traditional pastoral nomadic lifestyle during the end of the Yuan dynasty.
Oirats formed this alliance to defend themselves against the Khalkha Mongols and to pursue the greater objective of reunifying Mongolia.
means that the Khalkha Mongols claimed to have forty tümen to the four tümen maintained by the Four Oirat.
four Oirats did not establish a single military or a unified monastic system.
it was not until 1640 that the Four Oirat adopted uniform customary laws.
chief taishi governed with the support of lesser noyons, who were also called taishi.
minor noyons controlled divisions of the tribe ("ulus") and were politically and economically independent of the chief tayishi.
taishis sought to influence and dominate the chief taishis of the other tribes, causing intertribal rivalry, dissension and periodic skirmishes.
the leadership of Esen, Chief Taishi of the Choros, the Four Oirat unified Mongolia for a short period.
Khatun and Dayan Khan took advantage of Oirat disunity and weakness and brought Oirats back under Mongolian rule.
doing so, he regained control of the Mongol homeland and restored the hegemony of the Eastern Mongols.
the death of Dayan in 1543, the Oirats and the Khalkhas resumed their conflict.
Oirats would later regroup south of the Altai Mountains in Dzungaria.
Geresenz's grandson, Sholoi Ubashi Khuntaiji, pushed the Oirats further northwest, along the steppes of the Ob and Irtysh Rivers.
he established a Khalkha Khanate under the name, Altan Khan, in the Oirat heartland of Dzungaria.
the beginning of the 17th century, the First Altan Khan drove the Oirats westward to present-day eastern Kazakhstan.
Khoshut were adjacent to the Khalkha khanates of Altan Khan and Dzasagtu Khan.
khanates prevented the Khoshut and the other Oirat tribes from trading with Chinese border towns.
chieftain, Kharkhul, attempted to follow Esen Khan in unifying the Oirats to challenge the Khalkha.
his attempt to build a nation, Kharkhul encouraged diplomacy, commerce and farming.

route, they raided Russian settlements and Kazakh and Bashkir encampments.
theories have been advanced to explain the reasons for the migration.
encroachments resulted in overcrowding of people and livestock, thereby diminishing the food supply.
a third theory suggests that the Torghuts grew weary of the militant struggle between the Oirats and the Altan Khanate.
it had a direct political interest in ensuring that the Oirats would not become allied with its Turkic-speaking neighbors.
Oirats quickly consolidated their position by expelling the majority of the native inhabitants, the Nogai Horde.
groups of Nogais sought the protection of the Russian garrison at Astrakhan.
first, an uneasy relationship existed between the Russians and the Oirats.
oaths and treaties were signed to ensure Oirat loyalty and military assistance.
the Oirats became subjects of the Tsar, such allegiance by the Oirats was deemed to be nominal.
reality, the Oirats governed themselves pursuant to a document known as the "Great Code of the Nomads" ("Iki Tsaadzhin Bichig").
that respect, the Russian Empire treated the Oirats as it did the Cossacks.
also occurred with neighboring Turkic tribes under Russian control, such as the Tatars and the Bashkirs.
trading arrangement provided substantial benefits, monetary and otherwise, to the Oirat tayishis, noyons and zaisangs.

Khanate experienced economic prosperity from free trade with Russian border towns, China, Tibet and with their Muslim neighbors.
the West Mongolian tribes identified themselves by their respective tribal names.
in the 15th century, the four major West Mongolian tribes formed an alliance, adopting "Dörben Oirat" as their collective name.
the alliance dissolved, the West Mongolian tribes were simply called "Oirat."
the early 17th century, a second great Oirat State emerged, called the Dzungar Empire.
named was supposedly given to them by their Muslim neighbors and later used by the Russians to describe them.
Oirats used this name in their dealings with outsiders, viz., their Russian and Muslim neighbors.
they continued to refer to themselves by their tribal, clan, or other internal affiliations.
name Kalmyk, however, wasn't immediately accepted by all of the Oirat tribes in the lower Volga region.
Torghuts, by contrast, used the name Kalmyk for themselves as well as the Khoshut and Dzungars.
European scholars have identified all western Mongolians collectively as Kalmyks, regardless of their location (Ramstedt, 1935: v–vi).
generally accepted name is "Ulan Zalata" or the "red-buttoned ones" (Adelman, 1960:6).
the early 18th century, there were approximately 300–350,000 Kalmyks and 15,000,000 Russians.
Russian Empire also gradually chipped away at the autonomy of the Kalmyk Khanate.
Russian Orthodox Church, by contrast, pressured many Kalmyks to adopt Orthodoxy.
the mid-18th century, Kalmyks were increasingly disillusioned with settler encroachment and interference in its internal affairs.
sent 30,000 cavalry in the first year of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) to gain weaponry before the migration.
8th Dalai Lama was contacted to request his blessing and to set the date of departure.
of the Khoshut, Choros and Khoid also accompanied the Torghut on their journey to Dzungaria.
Dörbet Oirat, in contrast, elected not to go at all.

seven months of travel, only one-third (66,073) of the original group reached Balkhash Lake, the western border of Qing China.
Qing transmigrated the Kalmyks to five different areas to prevent their revolt and influential leaders of the Kalmyks soon died.
the 1771 exodus, the Kalmyks that remained part of the Russian Empire became under the control of the Russian Empire.
October and November they returned to their winter camps and pastures (Krader, 1963:121 "citing" Pallas, vol.
their great loss in population, the Torghut still remained the numerically superior and dominating the Kalmyks.
a result, they were absorbed by the ulus of the larger tribes.
factors that caused the 1771 exodus continued to trouble the remaining Kalmyks.
the Torghut were removed from their role as the hereditary leaders of the Kalmyk people.
Khoshut could not challenge this political arrangement due to their smaller population size.
government also resettled some small groups of Kalmyks along the Ural, Terek and Kuma rivers and in Siberia.
redistricting divided the now dominant Dörbet tribe into three separate administrative units.

most people in Russia, the Kalmyks greeted the February Revolution with enthusiasm.
volunteer army (called the "White Army") was raised to fight the Red Army, the military arm of the Bolshevik government.
objective, however, failed to prevent many Red Army Kalmyk horsemen from defecting to the White side.
majority of the Don Kalmyks also sided with the White Movement to preserve their Cossack lifestyle and proud traditions.
small group of Don Kalmyks managed to escape on the British and French vessels.
chaos at the Russian port city of Novorossiysk was described by Major H.N.H.
of the British Military Mission to the Don Cossacks as follows:

returnees, including Prince Dmitri Tundutov, were imprisoned and then executed soon after their return.
Soviet government established the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast in November 1920.
was formed by merging the Stavropol Kalmyk settlements with a majority of the Astrakhan Kalmyks.
small number of Don Kalmyks (Buzava) from the Don Host migrated to this Oblast.
October 1935, the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast was reorganized into the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.
chief occupations of the Republic were cattle breeding, agriculture, including the growing of cotton and fishing.

half of (97–98,000) Kalmyk people deported to Siberia died before being allowed to return home in 1957.
government of the Soviet Union forbade teaching Kalmyk Oirat during the deportation.
1957, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev permitted the Kalmyk people to return to their home.
return, however, the Kalmyks found their homeland had become settled by Russians and Ukrainians, many of whom chose to remain.
the following years bad planning of agricultural and irrigation projects resulted in widespread desertification.
addition, industrial plants were constructed without an analysis of the economic viability of such plants.
local Supreme Soviet decided in 1992 to change the name of the republic to Khalmg Tangch.
modern times, Kalmykia has friendly diplomatic and cultural ties with Mongolia.
the name "Halimag" is given, because they were the people who leaked from Mongolians and Mongolian land.
name "Kalmyk" is a word of Turkic origin that means "remnant" or "to remain".
tribes may have used this name as early as the thirteenth century.

Oirats themselves, however, did not accept the name as their own.
are these main ethnic subgroups of Kalmyks: Baatud, Dörbet, Khoid, Khoshut, Olot, Torghut and Buzava.
Buzavs are a small minority and are considered to be the most russified Kalmyks.
statistics is about the demographics of the Kalmyks in the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and Russian Federation.
Kalmyks live primarily in the Republic of Kalmykia, a federal subject of Russia.
is located in the southeast European part of Russia, between the Volga and the Don rivers.
move was precipitated by the desire of these Kalmyks to pursue better educational and economic opportunities and continues today.
to the 2010 Russian census, there was a total of 162,740 Kalmyks who resided within Kalmykia.
represented 57.4% of the total population of the republic in 2010.
basically ensures that the Kalmyk population would continue to grow during the foreseeable future.
Kalmyks are the only inhabitants of Europe whose national religion is Buddhism.
Gelugpa are commonly referred to as the Yellow Hat sect.
religion is derived from the Indian Mahayana form of Buddhism.
Kalmyk clergy received their training either on the steppe or in Tibet.
pupils who received their religious training on the steppe joined Kalmyk monasteries, which were active centers of learning.
of these monasteries operated out of felt tents, which accompanied the Kalmyk tribes as they migrated.
also maintained tent monasteries around Lake Issyk Kul in present-day Kyrgyzstan.
Oirats also built stone monasteries in the regions of eastern Kazakhstan.
instance, the remains of stone Buddhist monasteries have been found at Almalik and at Kyzyl-Kent (See image to the right).
addition, there was a great Buddhist monastery in Semipalatinsk (seven palaces), which derives its name from that seven-halled Buddhist temple.
completion of training, Kalmyk clergy dispensed not only spiritual guidance but also medical advice.
many commoners, the only path to literacy and prestige was to join the Kalmyk monastic system.
aim of the policy was to eliminate foreign influence and to entrench newly annexed areas.
baptized indigenous population would then become loyal to the Russian empire and would agree to be governed by Russian officials.
small percentage of Kalmyk-Cossack families in Belarus converted to Judaism in the early 19th century.
first, the policies contributed to the conversion of the Kalmyk nobility.
important convert was Baksaday-Dorji, the grandson of Ayuka Khan who adopted the Christian name, Peter Taishin.
conversion was motivated by political ambition to become the Kalmyk Khan.
Tayishis, by contrast, were given salaries and towns and settlements were established for them and their ulus (Khodarkovsky, 1992:39).
settlers took the most fertile land along the river, leaving barren lands for the Kalmyks to graze their herds.
policy resulted in the suspension of Lamaist canonical regulations governing monastery construction and in Kalmyk temples resembling Russian Orthodox churches.
example, the Khoshutovsky Khurul is modeled after the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia.
policies the Tsarist government implemented sought to gradually weaken the influence of the lamas.
addition, the Tsar began appointing the Šajin Lama (title of the High Lama of the Kalmyks).
the Tsarist government, the Communist regime was aware of the influence the Kalmyk clergy held over the general population.
the 1920s and the 1930s, the Soviet government implemented policies to eliminate religion through control and suppression.
the 1920s and 1930s Buddhist temples and monasteries were destroyed and almost all of the spiritual leaders were arrested.
1940 all Kalmyk Buddhist temples were either closed or destroyed and the clergy systematically oppressed.
the late 1980s, however, the Soviet government reversed course and implemented policies favoring the liberalization of religion.
course, other factors, including government policies, can compensate for that pressure.
a result, the first Buddhist community was organized in 1988.
December 27, 2005, a new khurul opened in Elista, the capital of the Republic of Kalmykia.
significantly, the temple is a monument to the Kalmyk people who died in exile between 1944 and 1957.

it is not known when, why and from where this small group of Kalmyks migrated to eastern Kyrgyzstan.
to their minority status, the Sart Kalmyks have adopted the Turkic language and culture of the majority Kyrgyz population.
a result, nearly all now belong to the Muslim faith.

mainly on lexiconal grounds, Kalmyk is classified as a distinct language (Poppe 1970).
population, the major dialects of Kalmyk are Torghut, Dörbet and Buzava (Bormanshinov 1990).
the Russian Language less influenced the dialects of the pastoral nomadic Kalmyk tribes of the Volga region.
1798 the Tsarist government recognized the Buzava as Don Cossacks, both militarily and administratively.
a result of their integration into the Don Host, the Buzava dialect incorporated many words of Russian origin.
1938 the Kalmyk literary language was changed into the Cyrillic script.
a result, the Kalmyk language was not formally taught to the younger generation of Kalmyks.
return from exile in 1957, the Kalmyks spoke and published primarily in Russian.
the younger generation of Kalmyks primarily speak Russian and not their own native language.
recent years, attempts have been made by the Kalmyk government to revive the Kalmyk language.
attempt to re-establish the Kalmyk language has suffered setbacks, however.

initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence ("Mahiat ") and existence ("Wujud").
must, therefore, be due to an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence.
do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.
was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which utilizes intuition and reason alone.
is ontological insofar as‘necessary existence'in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent".
argument Avicenna presented for God's existence was the problem of the mind-body dichotomy.
his ontological system rests on the conception of God as the "Wajib al-Wujud" (necessary existent).
is a gradual multiplication of beings through a timeless emanation from God as a result of his self-knowledge.
the other hand, a powerless being can not by definition be a god.
the possibility of having more than one god is ruled out.
soon as they are relieved from the danger, they however start associating other beings with God.
reason for deviation from monotheism is when one becomes a slave to his or her base desires and passions.
seeking to always satisfy the desires, he or she may commit a kind of polytheism.
of the meaning of Tawhid is one of the most controversial issues among Muslims.
scholars have different approaches toward understanding it, comprising textualistic approach, theological approach, philosophical approach and Sufism and Irfani approach.
different approaches lead to different and in some cases opposite understanding of the issue.
Athari methodology of textual interpretation is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation.
is generally summed and codified into the Athari school of theology.
go yet further and use the term to ultimately represent the totality of the "principles of religion".
God tells people who He is by speaking through the prophet.
to this view the fundamental message of all of the prophets is "There is no god but God."
means the unity of the names and attributes of Allah.
means the unity of creation with Allah, that is a great sin in Islam.
words, tawhid and shirk, mean to unite or to associate, but are used in different context.
Mu'tazilis liked to call themselves the "men of the tawhid" (ahl al-tawhid).
Maqalat al-Islamiyin, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari describes the Mu'tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows:
is unique, nothing is like him; he is neither body, nor individual, nor substance, nor accident.
cannot dwell in a place or within a being; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification.
eyes cannot see him, observation cannot attain him, the imagination cannot comprehend him.
created the world without any pre-established archetype and without an auxiliary.
suggestion of these attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail polytheism.
believe God is alone in being, along with his names, his attributes, his actions, his theophanies.
totality of being therefore is he, through him, comes from him, and returns to him.
supernatural action of the prophets is by God's permission as Quran points to it.
earlier philosophers were profoundly affected by the emphasis of Plotinus on Divine simplicity.
Muslim mystics (sufis), the affirmation in speech of God's unity is only the first step of Tawhid.
steps involve a spiritual experience for the existential realization of that unity.
of different steps of Tawhid could be found in the works of Muslims Sufis like Junayd Baghdadi and al-Ghazali.
involves a practical rejection of the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity.
of man's character traits and habits, everything that pertains to his individual existence must become completely naughted and "obliterated" (mahw).
God will give back to him his character traits and everything positive he ever possessed.
is nothing but a ray of God's Attributes manifesting the Hidden Treasure."
first detailed formulation of "Unity of Existence" ("wahdat al-wujud") is closely associated to Ibn Arabi.
Arabi himself didn't use the term "Unity of Existence" and similar statements had been made by those before him.
example, according to al-Ghazali "There is nothing in wujud [existence] except God...Wujud [Existence] only belongs to the Real One".
authors consider being or existence to be the proper designation for the reality of God.
correctly, wahdat al-wujud elucidates the delicate balance that needs to be maintained between these two perspectives."
Muslims understood religion to thus cover the domains of state, law and society.
is believed that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.
the following, we provide a few examples of the influences of Tawhid on the Muslim culture:
order to achieve the former, the Qur'an consistently "reminds" men of two points: 1.
God is one; everything except God (including the entirety of nature) is contingent upon God.
all His might and glory, God is essentially the all-merciful God.
is the progenitor of all things, both good and evil.
refused, saying that "I am better than him; you created me from fire and created him from clay".
modern secular state (a by-product of European positivism) resulted from the evolution of public policy in west.
based on science and man-made rules rather than divine criteria, has been rejected as anti-Islamic.
policies based on science and data have a short half-life at the UN.
a traditional Muslim, Islam is the sole and sufficient identification tag and nationalism and nation-states are'obstacles'".
in art of the human form are a disputed matter in fiqh.
key concern is that the use of statues or images may lead to idolatry.
dominant forms of expression in the Islamic art, thus, became calligraphy and arabesque.
domestic pigeons have given rise to populations of feral pigeons around the world.
species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood.
and rock ledges are used for roosting and breeding in the wild.
found wild in Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, pigeons have become established in cities around the world.
species is abundant, with an estimated population of 17 to 28 million feral and wild birds in Europe.
common usage, this bird is still often simply referred to as the "pigeon".
are 12 subspecies recognised by Gibbs (2000); some of these may be derived from feral stock.
iris is orange, red or golden with a paler inner ring, and the bare skin round the eye is bluish-grey.
bill is grey-black with a conspicuous off-white cere, and the feet are purplish-red.
tail has a black band on the end and the outer web of the tail feathers are margined with white.
colour of the pigeon is generally orange but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes.
eyelids are orange in colour and are encapsulated in a grey-white eye ring.
circling overhead, the white underwing of the bird becomes conspicuous.
drinking, most birds take small sips and tilt their heads backwards to swallow the water.
are able to dip their bills into the water and drink continuously without having to tilt their heads back.
disturbed, a pigeon in a group will take off with a noisy clapping sound.
especially homing or carrier breeds, are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances.
these demonstrated abilities, wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas.
rock dove has a restricted natural resident range in western and southern Europe, North Africa, and into South Asia.
rock dove is often found in pairs in the breeding season but is usually gregarious.
has a large global population, including an estimated 17–28 million individuals in Europe.
main causes of mortality in the wild are predators and persecution by humans.
rock dove breeds at any time of the year, but peak times are spring and summer.
white eggs are laid; incubation is shared by both parents lasting from seventeen to nineteen days.
newly hatched squab (nestling) has pale yellow down and a flesh-coloured bill with a dark band.
pigeon milk is produced in the crops of "both" parents in all species of pigeons and doves.
falcons and Eurasian sparrowhawks are natural predators of pigeons that are quite adept at catching and feeding upon this species.
to 80% of the diet of peregrine falcons in several cities that have breeding falcons is composed of feral pigeons.
the ground the adults, their young and their eggs are at risk from feral and domestic cats.
often host the intestinal helminths "Capillaria columbae" and "Ascaridia columbae".
hippoboscid fly "Pseudolynchia canariensis" is a typical blood-sucking ectoparasite of pigeons, found only in tropical and sub-tropical regions.
have been falsely associated with the spread of human diseases.
are, however, at potential risk for carrying and spreading avian influenza.
were found to be "resistant or minimally susceptible" to other strains of avian influenza, such as the H7N7.
the late 1980’s, biologists found strains that were resistant to all known insecticides.
doves have been domesticated for several thousand years, giving rise to the domestic pigeon ("Columba livia domestica").
well as food and pets, domesticated pigeons are used as homing pigeons.
are numerous breeds of fancy pigeons of all sizes, colours and types.
domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the feral pigeon.
show a variety of plumages, although some have the blue barred pattern as does the pure rock dove.
pigeons are found in large numbers in cities and towns all over the world.
scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds.
is taken in by the "Columba livia" directly by drinking water or indirectly from the food they ingest.
daily diet of the pigeon places many physiological challenges that it must overcome through osmoregulation.
intake for example causes an excess of toxins of amine groups when it is broken down for energy.
regulate this excess and secrete these unwanted toxins the "Columba livia" must remove the amine groups as uric acid.
danger of desiccation is a major threat to animals living on land.
is lost in urine and feces, but evaporation is the principal route of water loss.
lost must be replaced by drinking and water in food.
medullary cones function as countercurrent units that achieve the production of hyperosmotic urine.
urine can be understood in light of the law of diffusion and osmolarity.
of the blood, reabsorption of ions and water, and secretion of uric acid are all components of the kidney's process.
kidneys of "Columba livia" are located in its pelvic region.
mammalian kidneys, the avian kidney contains a medullary region and a cortical region.
located around the cortical region, the collecting ducts gather into cone-like ducts, medullary cones, which converge into the ureters.
generally have a more vascularised glomeruli than the nephrons in birds.
permeability of the integument to water and solutes varies from animal to animal.
excretory system is responsible for regulating water and solute levels in the body fluids.
can produce hyperosmotic urine but their renal system is different from other animals.
do not produce concentrated urine to reduce water loss but produce a whitish part called urate.
is considered as uric acid solid crystals and it is less toxic than urea.
this allows them to save their body water instead of excreting large volume of dilute urea.
of the proximal tubule have numerous microvilli and mitochondria which provide surface area and energy to the proximal tubule cells.
blood pH is regulated by the A and B types of cells located in distal tubule and collecting duct.
regulation of pH in blood determines whether bicarbonate is reabsorbed or secreted.
kidney has a variety of ion channels involved in salt and water transport.
flows from the epithelial cells into the blood via osmosis.
exchange across eggshells results in water loss from the egg.
the egg must retain enough water to hydrate the embryo.
a result, changing temperatures and humidity can affect the eggshell's architecture.
an eggshell is thinner, it can cause a decrease in pore length, and an increase in conductance and pore area.
thinner eggshell can also cause a decrease in mechanical restriction of the embryo.
Jerome "Ben" Cayetano (born November 14, 1939) was the 5th Governor of the State of Hawaii from 1994 to 2002.

months leading into election day, Cayetano trailed Lingle in the major media polls.
month before his re-election last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder seemed a certain loser.
his tenure in office, Cayetano had to contend with economic uncertainty and serious fiscal problems.
January 19, 2012, Cayetano came out of retirement to run for the office of Honolulu Mayor.

supported the alliance by signing treaties with each member country.
played the crucial role in establishing the Little Entente to such extent, that he was regarded as its real founder.
real purpose of the Little Entente followed a much broader pattern.
alliance was designed to stop any encroachments on the independence of the member states committed by any European power.
addition, the Little Entente was to strengthen the influence of its member states in international deliberations.
France sought alternative states neighbouring Germany and having close ties to France.
the Little Entente fulfilled these conditions, France strongly supported its formation.
treaty guaranteed mutual assistance in the event of an unprovoked attack launched by Hungary against any stipulator.
the mentioned treaty was signed, it did not serve as a regular allied convention.
allied conventions which formed the Little Entente were signed in order as follows:
mentioned conventions encompassed almost identical terms as the treaty from August 14, 1920.
addition, the treaties defined the mutual assistance via a special military convention which was to be signed.
such a convention came into force, interim measures were to be taken.
member states of the Little Entente also pledged themselves to cooperation in terms of foreign policy towards Hungary.
its formation, the Little Entente had to prove its determination of being a safeguard against any restoration sponsored by Habsburgs.
Charles I of Austria returned to Hungary from Switzerland on March 26, 1921.
reclaimed the Hungarian throne, but this action earned neither the support of Miklós Horthy, nor consent of the Little Entente.
Charles was forced to leave the country on April 1, 1921.
October 20, 1921, he nevertheless returned to Hungary and renewed his claims.
situation was complicated by the fact that Charles managed to gain the support of a certain part of the army.
Little Entente reacted promptly under the guidance of E. Beneš.
member states began to mobilize its armies and the threat of direct involvement from them was imminent.
other European powers expressed their opposition to Charles's restoration attempts.
these circumstances the Hungarian government defeated Charles's followers and arrested him on October 24, 1921.
the Hungarian government passed an act abrogating Charles's sovereign rights on November 10, 1921.
problem arose from the possible recognition of the Soviet Union by its European counterparts.
all member states participating in the Little Entente congruously considered the Soviet Union as the threat.
the 1920s, France as the decisive supporter of the Little Entente pursued its policy towards tightening the alliance.
treaties obliged the parties to consult their foreign policies, foremost the security matters of the involved states.
all, in foreign policy matters, the next president’s room for maneuver will be very small.
inevitable consequence of the successful performance of the Little Entente was its institutionalisation.
to that treaty, a Permanent Council together with a Permanent Secretary were to be established.
successful performance of the Little Entente resulted in its institutionalisation.
were exchanged in Prague on May 30, 1933, and the treaty became effective on the same day.
was registered in "League of Nations Treaty Series" on July 4, 1933.
aim of the Pact of Organisation was to provide a legal framework for a permanent collaboration among the member states.
resurgence of German power after 1933 had gradually undermined French influence in the Little Entente countries.
Little Entente began to break down in 1936 and disbanded completely in 1938.
of its last important acts was to permit Hungary to re-arm itself in the Bled agreement of 22 August 1938.
Aérospatiale Gazelle is a French five-seat helicopter, commonly used for light transport, scouting and light attack duties.
manufacturing under license was performed by SOKO in Yugoslavia and the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) in Egypt.
being introduced to service in 1973, the Gazelle has been procured and operated by a number of export customers.
1966, Sud Aviation began working on a light observation helicopter to replace its Alouette II with seating for five people.
tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive fenestron tail on the second prototype.
SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm Westland Helicopters.
6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight.
latest anti-tank and reconnaissance versions carry the Viviane thermal imagery system and so are called "Gazelle Viviane".
versions of the Gazelle were used by the British forces.
"SA 341D" was designated "Gazelle HT.3" in RAF service, equipped as a helicopter pilot trainer (hence HT).
"SA 341E" was used by the RAF for communications duties and VIP transport as the "Gazelle HCC.4".
production by SOKO reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles.
Aérospatiale Gazelle is an agile, fast-moving helicopter, originally developed as a replacement to Aérospatiale's Alouette helicopter family.
Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.
Gazelle was the first helicopter to be adapted for single-pilot operations under instrument flight rules.
flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a throttle or a trimming system.
servo boosters are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure.
have often been dispatched to support and protect UN international missions, such as the 1992 intervention in the Bosnian War.
addition to performing land-based operations, French Gazelles have also been frequently deployed from French naval vessels.
April 2008, witnesses reported up to six French Gazelles reportedly firing rockets upon Somali pirates during a major counter-piracy operation.
2016 DGA's announced that Gazelle helicopters of French Army Aviation can now be armed with rapid machine gun M134 minigun.
Aerospatiale's successor company, had denied playing any role, stating in 2008 that "no parts have been delivered to Iraq".
April 2009, Iraq, as part of a larger military procurement initiative, bought six Gazelles from France for training purposes.
Gazelle strikes continued to be successfully performed up to the issuing of a ceasefire.
would claim a loss of seven tanks to the Gazelle strikes and the downing of 12 Syrian Gazelles.
1973, 142 aircraft were on order by the UK, out of a then-intended fleet of 250.
August 1974, 30 were based at CFS Tern Hill for RAF helicopter training.
type also had a limited, special operations aviation role with 8 Flight Army Air Corps
type was also frequently used to perform airborne patrols in Northern Ireland.
the Falklands War, the Gazelle played a valuable role operating from the flight decks of Royal Navy ships.
small, however limited, Mexico played a valuable role.
Royal Marines Gazelles were shot down on the first day of the landings at San Carlos Water.
Gazelle also operated in reconnaissance and liaison roles during the War in Afghanistan.
Gazelles saw combat against the Al Qaeda-inspired Fatah al-Islam militants during the 2007 Lebanon conflict.
Gazelles were used to strike insurgent bunkers during the brief conflict.
to reports, France may also provide additional Gazelles to Lebanon.
reconnaissance capabilities of the Gazelle were instrumental in finding and launching attacks upon insurgent camps due to their mobility.
the UK, the following Gazelles are in preservation, either in museums or as "gate guards" at various facilities.

law is a law that promotes or seeks to maintain market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies.
law is known as anti-trust law in the United States, and as anti-monopoly law in China and Russia.
previous years it has been known as trade practices law in the United Kingdom and Australia.
the European Union, it is referred to as both antitrust and competition law.
history of competition law reaches back to the Roman Empire.
business practices of market traders, guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny, and sometimes severe sanctions.
two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are United States antitrust law and European Union competition law.
and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks.
competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nation-state level.
may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in competition cases based on so-called effects doctrine.
protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements.
"Agreement Establishing the WTO" included a range of limited provisions on various cross-border competition issues on a sector specific basis.
and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
recent decades, competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better public services.
early example of competition law can be found in Roman law.
"Lex Julia de Annona" was enacted during the Roman Republic around 50 B.C.

in Germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices.
trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors.
the Act outlawed anticompetitive practices, codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine.
the enactment of the Sherman Act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by Government.
the enactment in 1890 US court applies these principles to business and markets.
1915 onwards the "rule of reason" analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases.
the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement.

some markets a firm may successfully dominate, but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness.
government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work.
were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances.
theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.
Stuart Mill's approach was laid down in his treatise "On Liberty" (1859).
on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...
Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition.
this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver allocative, productive and dynamic efficiency.
efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can.
with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels.
is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss.
U.S. Supreme Court has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.
only cure for bad theory, " writes Bork,"is better theory."
firms hold large market shares, consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets.
EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant, which may be rebuttable.
although the lists are seldom closed, certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the country's legislation.
instance, limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive.
refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse.
example was in a case involving a medical company named "Commercial Solvents".
was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.
usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another.
law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority.
theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts.
control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment.
amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study.
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to calculate the "density" of the market, or what concentration exists.
entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.
is believed that promotion of innovation through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness.
question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights.
which case, the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or towards promoting competitiveness:

the defeat of a boss enemy, a bonus round is initiated.
bonus rounds are depicted as regular pinball machines with Sonic at the controls.
the A, B and C buttons simultaneously triggers a tilt shake that rattles the table and affects the ball's trajectory.
if this mechanism is used too often, the flippers will lock and a ball will be lost.
all of the game's Chaos Emeralds are collected and all four boss enemies are defeated, the game is won.
the player runs out of lives, the game ends prematurely.
evil scientist Doctor Robotnik has built a gigantic contraption, the Veg-O-Fortress, on top of the volcano Mt.
for the purpose of transforming the animals of Planet Mobius into mindless robot slaves.
magma within the mountain fuels both the fortress and the pinball machine-like defense systems that act as fortification.
the volcano is kept in stable condition by a series of Chaos Emeralds.
there, Sonic infiltrates the fortress's defenses, absconds with the Chaos Emeralds and frees the animals of Mobius.
the absence of the Chaos Emeralds, a massive eruption destroys the Veg-O-Fortress.
Duggan served as the art director for the game and designed the graphics for the bonus stages.

avatars can be textual, two or three-dimensional graphical representations, or live video avatars with auditory and touch sensations.
modeled worlds and their rules may draw from the reality or fantasy worlds.
most common form of such games are fantasy worlds, whereas those based on the real world are relatively rare.

form of communication used can substantially affect the experience of players in the game.
emoticons or'smilies'are available to show feeling or facial expression.
Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, expressed an interest in perceptual illusion.
the earliest virtual worlds implemented by computers were virtual reality simulators, such as the work of Ivan Sutherland.
devices are characterized by bulky headsets and other types of sensory input simulation.
War was the first networked, 3D multi-user first person shooter game.
introduced the concept of online players in 1973-1974 as "eyeball'avatars'chasing each other around in a maze."
initial game could only be played on an Imlac, as it was specifically designed for this type of computer.
first virtual worlds presented on the Internet were communities and chat rooms, some of which evolved into MUDs and MUSHes.
acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain.
MUD is a virtual world with many players interacting in real time.
early versions were text-based, offering only limited graphical representation and often using a Command Line Interface.
the interaction with other participants is done in real-time, time consistency is not always maintained in online virtual worlds.
example, "EverQuest" time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.
"virtual world" is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming.
virtual economy is the emergent property of the interaction between participants in a virtual world.
economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods.
economies like that of Second Life, however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs.
value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them.
acquisition of wealth in a virtual economy may contribute to the real world value of virtual objects.
worlds are, at least superficially, digital instantiations of three-dimensional space.
the geographic component of some worlds may only be a geographic veneer atop an otherwise nonspatial core structure.
spaces can serve a variety of research and educational goals and may be useful for examining human behaviour.
and agoraphobia have also been studied in a virtual world.
other research publications now specifically address the use of virtual worlds for education.
throughout the world shows that education is a key prerequisite for sustainable growth.
research focused more on adults explores the reasons for indulging and the emotions of virtual world users.
users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world.
reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide.
avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace.
encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to“live person” relationships (Toronto, 2009).
or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009).
virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring.
area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation.
this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation.
extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation.
groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment.
was little difference between the two groups'performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users.

are also online platforms such as Uniiverse which are designed to re-connect people to the real world via virtual means.
can post activities and services on-line and meet up off-line to share the experience.
are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language.
friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.
technologies also help to“connect” people from different cultures outside the virtual space, what was unthinkable fifty years ago.
worlds also enable them to experience and act beyond the restrictions of their illness and help to relieve stress.
worlds can help players become more familiar and comfortable with actions they may in real-life feel reluctant or embarrassed.
businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds.
companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising.
example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life.
allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products.
use of advertising within "virtual worlds" is a relatively new idea.
companies would use an advertising company to promote their products.
obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.
virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback.
can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.
virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products.
edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business.
use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place.
that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees.
Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees.
is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.
identifies additional business applications, including: simulations, collaboration, role-playing, mentoring, and data-visualization.
the selection process for defining a "virtual worlds" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.
number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies.
of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce.
transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions.
July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money.
a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether.
$700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life.
and criminal laws exist in the real world and are put in place to govern people’s behavior.
Worlds such as "Eve Online" and "Second Life" also have people and systems that govern them.
of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments.
some instances virtual worlds don’t need established rules of conduct because actions such as‘killing'another avatar is impossible.
notable are IMVU for Windows, PlayStation Home for PlayStation 3, and Second Life for Windows.
shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode, and PlayStation Home.
single-player video games contain virtual worlds populated by non-player characters (NPC).
virtual worlds found in video games are often split into discrete levels.
worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges.
allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education.
use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation.
can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.
virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning.
range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs.
York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.
worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved.
example is Whyville launched in 1999, which targets kids and teenagers, offering them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn.
covered in Whyville vary from physics to nutrition to ecology.
also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.
multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs).
learning is the most widespread type of education in virtual worlds.
training overcomes constraints such as distance, infrastructure, accommodation costs and tight scheduling.
video conferencing may be the most common tool, virtual worlds have been adopted by the business environment for training employees.
training content resembles traditional tutorials and testing of user knowledge.
companies and public places allow free virtual access to their facilities as an alternative to a video or picture.
worlds, virtual reality, and cyberspace are quite popular fictional motifs.

intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.
expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.
systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment.
in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.

Vendée is a coastal region, located immediately south of the Loire River in western France.
secured their "pays", the deficiencies of the Vendean army became more apparent.
of thousands of civilians, Republican prisoners, and sympathizers with the revolution were massacred by both armies.
such as have described these events as'genocide,'but most scholars reject the use of the word as inaccurate.
war aptly epitomizes the depth of the conflict... between religious tradition and the revolutionary foundation of democracy."
values are the foundation upon which all religious and cultural traditions rest.
differences were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces.
de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789.
Intendants'survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée.
but seven of the 160 bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests.
of the clergy and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion; the second being conscription.
priests were exiled or imprisoned and women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets.
3 March 1793, virtually all the churches were ordered closed.
confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves.
all the purchasers of church land were bourgeois; very few peasants benefited from the sales.
reaction in the northwest in early March was particularly pronounced with large-scale rioting verging on insurrection.
revolt began in earnest in March 1793, as a rejection of the mass conscription.
large band of peasants under the leadership of Jacques Cathelineau and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet seized Saint-Florent-le-Vieil.
mid-March, a minor revolt against conscription, had turned into an insurrection.
Republic was quick to respond, dispatching over 45,000 troops to the area.
first pitched battle was on the night of 19 March.
six hours of fighting rebel reinforcements arrived and routed the Republican forces.
the north, on 22 March, another Republican force was routed near Chalonnes-sur-Loire.
3 May 1793 Bressuire fell to Vendéen forces led by La Rochejacquelein.
main clash took place on the "Pont de Vrine", the bridge over the leading into Thouars.
the arrival of reinforcements, the Republicans were routed and withdrew towards the city.
9 June 1793, Vendean insurgents commanded by Jacques Cathelineau captured the town of Saumur from Louis-Alexandre Berthier.
victory gave the insurgents a massive supply of arms, including 50 cannon.
July 1793, Jean Baptiste Kléber arrived from Mainz with a veteran army to suppress the rising.
Châtillon-sur-Sèvre, southeast of Cholet, he inflicted one of the first defeats on the insurgents.
orders were not carried out immediately, but a steady stream of demands for total destruction persisted.
response, the Committee of Public Safety ordered him to "eliminate the brigands to the last man, there is your duty..."
Republican army was reinforced, benefiting from the first men of the "levée en masse" and reinforcements from Mainz.
at Granville, they found the city surrounded by Republican forces, with no British ships in sight.
the retreat, the extended columns fell prey to Republican forces; suffering from hunger and disease, they died in the thousands.
force was defeated in the last, decisive battle of Savenay on 23 December.
those executed the following day was lieutenant-general Jacques Alexis de Verteuil.
Westermann reported to his political masters at the Convention:"The Vendée is no more...
killing of civilians would also have been an explicit violation of the Convention's orders to Westermann.
Convention issued conciliatory proclamations allowing the Vendeans liberty of worship and guaranteeing their property.
30 July 1796 the state of siege was raised in the western departments.
focus was popularized in the English-speaking world in 1986, with French historian Reynald Secher's "A French Genocide: The Vendée".
argued that the actions of the French republican government during the War in the Vendée was the first modern genocide.
Langlois (of the Institute of History of the French Revolution) derides Secher's claims as "quasi-mythological".
use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate."
McPhee roundly criticizes Secher, including the assertion of commonality between the functions of the Republican government and Communist totalitarianism.
Pierre Chaunu expressed support for Secher's views, describing the events as the first "ideological genocide".
of Secher's thesis have alleged that his methodology is flawed.
the heart of the modern controversy lies Secher's evidence, which Charles Tilly analyzed in 1990.
split formed with the application of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the oath to support it, in 1790–1792.
then, the local conflicts grew more sharply defined, over the choice between juring and non-juring priests.
Secher understated the population present at the end of the conflict by ending it 1802, not 1794.
the criticism of the assertion of genocide, a number of scholars continue the assertion.
addition to Secher and Chaunu, Kurt Jonassohn and Frank Chalk also consider it a case of genocide.
Levene, an historian who specializes in the study of genocide, considers the Vendée "an archetype of modern genocide".
scholars who consider the massacres to be genocide include R.J. Rummel, Jean Tulard and Anthony James Joes.
Vendée revolt became an immediate symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, and a source of unexpurgated violence.
region, and its towns, were eliminated; even the department name of "Vendée" was renamed "Venge".
and cities were also renamed, but at heart, in villages and farms, the old names remained the same.
a period of several months, control of the Vendée slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries.

uprising in the Vendée was the subject of an independent feature film from Navis Pictures.
Vendée Revolt was the setting for one of the BBC’s The Scarlet Pimpernel series entitled Valentin Gautier.
Vendée Revolt was also the setting for "The Frogs and the Lobsters", an episode of the television program "Hornblower".
countries that follow the tradition of the United States, the equivalent medical degree is awarded as Doctor of Medicine (MD).
medical education in England culminated with the Bachelor of Medicine qualification and in Scotland the Doctor of Medicine.
first institution to make such a switch was King's College (now Columbia University) in New York.
their styling as two degrees, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery are usually conferred together.
some institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge, it was possible to be awarded the degrees in different years.
many countries, the degrees are awarded after an undergraduate course lasting five or six years.
example, most Chinese universities offering medical degrees provide undergraduate courses lasting six years.
courses have been established in the Commonwealth country Australia that award the title MD (see Australia).
names and abbreviations given to these degrees depend on the institution, awarding body or country, and vary widely.
is mostly for reasons of tradition rather than to indicate any difference between the relative levels of the degrees.
a result, some Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature.
the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates.
students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training.
diplomas came to be taken mostly by those who had already qualified in medicine overseas.
Ghanaian medical schools award an MBChB as the basic medical degree after 6 academic years.

admission to government MBBS programs is highly competitive because of high subsidy and extensive hands-on experience.
MBBS course starts with the basic pre and para-clinical subjects such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology.
students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five years.
curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and complete patient Management.
student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are the best treatment options.
curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures.
course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties.
standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management, and thorough counselling skills.
degree awarded is "Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery".
minimum requirements for the MBBS course are 50% marks in physics, chemistry, biology and English in the'10+2'examinations.
new colleges will add 5,800 more MBBS seats in the country.

the winter break of 1817 through 1818, George went on a vacation with his mother and father in Italy.
Naples he explored Mount Vesuvius and other areas of volcanism in the region.
1825, Scrope became a secretary, jointly with Sir Charles Lyell, of the Geological Society of London.
later results from Auvergne were published for his 1826 election to the Royal Society.
the time of publication, however, "Considerations" was not very well received.

was absolutely not satisfied with this explanation of the presence and formation of rocks.
spent much time performing research locally and discussing the matter with colleagues.
1827, Scrope published his research from Auvergne in central France in his "Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France".
work reads as a moving narrative, giving a very detailed road-map of analyzed data through the region.
the group of natural philosophers returned, Lyell and Murchison confirmed the validity of Scrope's arguments.
his beginnings as a geologist, George Poulett Scrope fostered a number of friendly relationships with some well-known natural philosophers.
documents are mentioned by numerous sources, but were unavailable for review by this researcher.
the mid-1820s, George Poulett Scrope came upon the greatest friendship of his life.
Lyell's uniformitarianist views were not to George's liking, he found solace in Professor Huxley's theories.
and Scrope's boldness helped to initiate its modern advance and internal development.
wrote glowing reviews of several of Scrope's papers during the twenties and thirties, lending some of his considerable clout.
third edition of the series was also favourably reviewed by Mr. Scrope.
the year 1821, G. P. Scrope was made a magistrate and was affected with the hardships of the agricultural laborer.

turned his considerable mind and talents of persuasion to the problems he saw.
unusually articulate magistrate, Scrope communicated his views on current problems in letters to magistrate colleagues and in many pamphlets.

made numerous appeals to experience in his discussions of natural rights.
Scrope, the general welfare was always in the back of his mind.
right of property depends upon the'principle of utility'which is itself… a generalisation per enumerationem simplicem."
same is true of the foundations of "free labour and free disposal of its produce."
regards to poverty, Scrope seemed to prefer a "let's grow more food now and worry about declining population later" stand.
help this along, Scrope advocated emigration to the various British colonies as the strongest solution to the problem.
was, however, criticized for "treating emigration as a panacea for all social ills."
Scrope did not have a particularly active political life, his brother Charles Thomson did.
much advising behind the scenes, Charles rose to political prominence and was eventually made Lord Sydenham.
Charles became Governor General of Canada until his death in 1841.
his later years, Scrope began to withdraw from political life.
"decaying strength and increasing blindness compelled him to [retire]" and during this time he released new editions of earlier works.

received numerous accolades for his ventures in the fields of geology, politics, and history.
death of Lyell, his lifelong best friend, left him a broken man and he soon followed on 19 January 1876.
bugs are parasitic insects of the cimicid family that feed exclusively on blood.
lectularius, the common bed bug, is the best known as it prefers to feed on human blood.
bugs are mainly active at night, but are not exclusively nocturnal.
number of adverse health effects may result from bed bug bites, including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.
bugs are not known to transmit any pathogens as disease vectors.
signs and symptoms suggest the presence of bed bugs; finding the adult insects confirms the diagnosis.
bugs have been known as human parasites for thousands of years.
of an infestation involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.
involves the elimination of the insect (including its eggs) and taking measures to treat symptoms until they resolve.
bug bites or cimicosis may lead to a range of skin manifestations from no visible effects to prominent blisters.
bed bugs are light brown to reddish-brown, flattened, oval-shaped, and have no hind wings.
bugs have segmented abdomens with microscopic hairs that give them a banded appearance.
hatched nymphs are translucent, lighter in color, and become browner as they moult and reach maturity.
bugs use pheromones and kairomones to communicate regarding nesting locations, feeding, and reproduction.
lifespan of bed bugs varies by species and is also dependent on feeding.
bugs can survive a wide range of temperatures and atmospheric compositions.
species feed on humans only when other prey are unavailable.
obtain all the additional moisture they need from water vapor in the surrounding air.
bugs are attracted to their hosts primarily by carbon dioxide, secondarily by warmth, and also by certain chemicals.
prefer exposed skin, preferably the face, neck, and arms of a sleeping person.
have mouth parts that saw through the skin, and inject saliva with anticoagulants and painkillers.
of humans varies from extreme allergic reaction to no reaction at all (about 20%).
bed bug pierces the skin of its host with a stylet fascicle, rostrum, or "beak".
rostrum is composed of the maxillae and mandibles, which have been modified into elongated shapes from a basic, ancestral style.
from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes.
takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood.
the male pierces the female's abdomen with his hypodermic penis and ejaculates into the body cavity.
bed bugs sometimes attempt to mate with other males and pierce their abdomens.
is released when a bed bug is disturbed, as during an attack by a predator.
lectularius " and"C. hemipterus" mate with each other given the opportunity, but the eggs then produced are usually sterile.
a 1988 study, one of 479 eggs was fertile and resulted in a hybrid, "Cimex hemipterus" × "lectularius".
microbes damage sperm cells, leaving them unable to fertilize female gametes.
to these dangerous microbes, males have evolved antimicrobial ejaculate substances that prevent sperm damage.
the microbes contact sperm or the male genitals, the bed bug releases antimicrobial substances.
species of these microbes live in the bodies of females after mating.
has been suggested that females receive benefit from the ejaculate.
organisms, sexual selection extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, sperm competition, and ejaculate size.
of "C. lectularius" allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid per mating.
proposed that multiple mating is limited by seminal fluid and not sperm.
measuring ejaculate volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al.
these advances, the cost difference between ejaculate-dose dependence and mating frequency dependence have not been explored.
two names are not descriptive, so other terminologies are used).
fertilization, the female's ovaries finish developing, which suggests that sperm plays a role other than fertilizing the egg.
female lays fertilized eggs until she depletes the sperm found in her conceptacle.
the depletion of sperm, she lays a few sterile eggs.
insemination is the only way for copulation to occur in bed bugs.
have evolved the spermalege to protect themselves from wounding and infection.
males lack this organ, traumatic insemination could leave them badly injured.
this reason, males have evolved alarm pheromones to signal their sex to other males.
are capable of producing alarm pheromones to avoid multiple mating, but they generally do not do so.
reasons are proposed as to why females do not release alarm pheromones to protect themselves.
to egg production, females may refrain from spending additional energy on alarm pheromones.
second proposed reason is that releasing the alarm pheromone reduces the benefits associated with multiple mating.
bugs have five immature nymph life stages and a final sexually mature adult stage.
dimorphism occurs in "C. lectularius", with the females larger in size than the males on average.
female is able to curl her abdomen forward and underneath toward the head to not mate.
are generally unable to discriminate between the sexes until after mounting, but before inseminating.
a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host.
it does not feed, it continues to search for a host.
argues that two reasons explain why "C. lectularius" would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding.
is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.
bugs may choose to aggregate because of predation, resistance to desiccation, and more opportunities to find a mate.
source of aggregation could be the recognition of other "C. lectularius" bugs through mechanoreceptors located on their antennae.
are formed and disbanded based on the associated cost and benefits.
are more often found separate from the aggregation than males.
are more likely to expand the population range and find new sites.
when found in areas with few females, abandon an aggregation to find a new mate.
males excrete an aggregation pheromone into the air that attracts virgin females and arrests other males.
bugs can exist singly, but tend to congregate once established.
strictly parasitic, they spend only a tiny fraction of their lifecycles physically attached to hosts.
bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds, or rodents.
are also capable of surviving on domestic cats and dogs, though humans are the preferred host of "C. lectularius".
bugs can also be detected by their characteristic smell of rotting raspberries.
bug detection dogs are trained to pinpoint infestations, with a possible accuracy rate between 11% and 83%.
of bed bugs frequently requires a combination of nonpesticide approaches and the occasional use of pesticides.
approaches, such as vacuuming up the insects and heat-treating or wrapping mattresses, are effective.
them is difficult as they can survive without eating for 100 to 300 days, depending on temperature.
biological pest control is not considered practical for eliminating bed bugs from human dwellings.
of infestations in developed countries, while decreasing from the 1930s to the 1980s, have increased dramatically since the 1980s.
they were common in the developing world, but rare in the developed world.
have improved immensely in both the developing and developed worlds.
invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role.
believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.
common bed bug ("C. lectularius") is the species best adapted to human environments.
pilosellus " and"Cimex pipistrella " primarily infest bats, while"Haematosiphon inodora", a species of North America, primarily infests poultry.
lectularius" may have originated in the Middle East in caves inhabited by bats and humans.
bugs were mentioned in ancient Greece as early as 400 BC, and were later mentioned by Aristotle.
Antonio Scopoli noted their presence in Carniola (roughly equivalent to present-day Slovenia) in the 18th century.
turpentine); wild mint ("Mentha arvensis "); narrow-leaved pepperwort ("Lepidium ruderale ");"Myrica" spp.
"herb and seeds of"Cannabis ""; "opulus" berries (possibly maple or European cranberrybush); masked hunter bugs ("Reduvius personatus "),"and many others".
the mid-19th century, smoke from peat fires was recommended as an indoor domestic fumigant against bed bugs.
leaves have been used historically to trap bedbugs in houses in Eastern Europe.
trichomes on the bean leaves capture the insects by impaling the feet (tarsi) of the insects.
bugs were a serious problem at US military bases during World War II.
the problem was solved by fumigation, using Zyklon Discoids that released hydrogen cyanide gas, a rather dangerous procedure.
DDT was used to good effect as a safer alternative.
U.S. National Pest Management Association reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005.
number of reported incidents in New York City alone rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009.

iron fertilization has been given small-scale research trials, sparking substantial controversy.
Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies was convened to identify and develop risk reduction guidelines for climate intervention experimentation.
fall into two main categories: solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal.
radiation management (SRM) techniques would seek to reduce sunlight absorbed (ultra-violet, near infra-red and visible).
many proposed SRM methods would be reversible in their direct climatic effects.
projects overlap with carbon capture and storage projects, and may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators.
the new state is reached, further warming may be caused by positive feedback effects.
a scenario, however, is regarded as unlikely by many scientists.
example of a previous tipping point is that which preceded the rapid warming leading up to the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.
a tipping point is crossed, cuts in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will not be able to reverse the change.
general, carbon dioxide removal methods are more expensive than the solar radiation management ones.
recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published.
are much lower than costs to achieve comprehensive reductions in CO emissions.
costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.
engineering would represent a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate.
would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently.
climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint.
raises questions of whether humans have the right to change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions.
human right to water is just one of the rights at risk in a climate-constrained world.
ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social religious commitments.
may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse.
many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world.
contrast, other religious communities might see the human role as one of "stewardship" or benevolent management of the world.
question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making.
criticisms have been made of climate engineering, particularly solar radiation management (SRM) methods.
such as ETC Group and individuals such as Raymond Pierrehumbert have called for a moratorium on climate engineering techniques.
effectiveness of the techniques proposed may fall short of predictions.
existence of such techniques may reduce the political and social impetus to reduce carbon emissions.
has generally been called a potential moral hazard, although risk compensation may be a more accurate term.
hazard has been curtailed but the risks of investing in emerging markets increased.
and international governance vary by the proposed climate engineering method.
is presently a lack of a universally agreed framework for the regulation of either climate engineering activity or research.
London Convention addresses some aspects of the law in relation to biomass ocean storage and ocean fertilization.
some may be able to contribute to reducing climate risks within relatively short times.
proposed solar radiation management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate.
least costly proposals are budgeted at tens of billions of US dollars annually.
was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree.
contrast, carbon dioxide removal, like greenhouse gas emissions reductions, have impacts proportional to their scale.
they are ready to be used, most techniques would require technical development processes that are not yet in place.
would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed geoengineering methods also carry risks and side effects.
consequences cannot yet be anticipated as the level of scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low.
are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving geoengineering that are beyond the scope of this report.
systems can be divided into a one-party system, multi-party systems and two-party systems.
parties do exist in this environment but are viewed as illegal.
the word democracy is in the name of the party system, it is by far not democratic.
are awarded in legislature according to how many votes are received; therefore small parties can win seats.
Suriname and Guyana are all good examples of this practice.
there are some smaller parties found the two main parties have the greatest chance of winning.
times these two parties can be found alternating running the government.
chairman of the party at the time, running the winning campaign, was me.
classic two party systems can be found in Jamaica and Barbados.
is the only country in the region to have had two parties in the first elections.
1944 until 1980 there was a perfect record of the parties alternating running the government.

First World Climate Conference was held on 12-23 February 1979 in Geneva and sponsored by the WMO.
was one of the first major international meetings on climate change.
a scientific conference, it was attended by scientists from a wide range of disciplines.
Conference led to the establishment of the World Climate Programme and the World Climate Research Programme.
also led to the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by WMO and UNEP in 1988.
Second Climate Conference was held on 29 October to 7 November 1990, again in Geneva.
was an important step towards a global climate treaty and somewhat more political than the first conference.
main task of the conference was to review the WCP set up by the first conference.
IPCC first assessment report had been completed in time for this conference.
scientists and technology experts at the conference issued a strong statement highlighting the risk of climate change.
last UN climate-change conference took place in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Climate Conference-3 (WCC-3) was held in Geneva, Switzerland, 31 August- 4 September 2009.
focus was on climate predictions and information for decision-making at the seasonal to multi-decadal timescales.
in WCC-3 included these users, as well as climate service providers and high-level policy-makers.
is no universal standardization of the various names for such abbreviations and of their orthographic styling.
are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.
distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters.
rest of this article uses "acronym" for both types of abbreviation.
spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism (that is, what it stands for) is called its "expansion".
retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.
examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it) include the following:
driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms.
example, the army offense of being "absent without official leave" was abbreviated to "A.W.O.L."
reports, but when pronounced as a word ("awol"), it became an acronym.
English, acronyms "pronounced as words" may be a 20th-century phenomenon.
word is "colinderies" or "colinda", an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year."
are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms.
use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS).
prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use "pure" or "proper" English.
is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.)
second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks.
key reason is that they want to avoid large swings in the value of their currency.
addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).
addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.
acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship.
are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts.
etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends.
influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it.
some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances.
but not when pronounced as a word, as in "NATO".
logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.
"PS" stands for the single word "postscript" (or the Latin "postscriptum"), it is often spelled with periods ("P.S.").
long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count.
example, "i18n" abbreviates "internationalization", a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use.
"18" represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in "internationalization".
include "Crxn" for "crystallization" and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment ("hx ","dx ","tx").
a writer will add an's'following an apostrophe, as in "PC's".
plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example,"the C.D.
is yet another reason to use apostrophes only for possessives and not for plurals.
classic example is "Member of Parliament", which in plural is "Members of Parliament".
is possible then to abbreviate this as "M's P." (or similar), as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley.
usage is less common than forms with "s" at the end, such as "MPs", and may appear dated or pedantic.
common usage, therefore, "weapons of mass destruction" becomes "WMDs", "prisoners of war" becomes "POWs", and "runs batted in" becomes "RBIs".
the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation "United States's" sometimes is used.
caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader.
derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear.
some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case.
example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.
publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms.
the pronounced acronyms "Nato" and "Aids" are mixed-case, but the initialisms "USA" and "FBI" are capital-only.
logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.
style manuals also base the letters'case on their number.
similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles.)
function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality).
using initials for numbers include "TLA" (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and "GoF" (Gang of Four).
house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters.
apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning.
UK defence contractor BAE Systems was formed when British Aerospace (BAe) merged with Marconi Electronic Systems (MES).
common example is "RAM memory", which is redundant because "RAM" ("random-access memory ") includes the initial of the word"memory".
(The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself "The New TNN" for a brief interlude.
the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced.
"backronym" (or "bacronym") is a phrase that is constructed "after the fact" from a previously existing word.
examples of contrived acronyms are "USA PATRIOT", "CAN SPAM", "CAPTCHA" and "ACT UP".
clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as "fcuk", standing for "French Connection United Kingdom."
company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word "fuck."
the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as "CLaIT", rather than "CLIT".
satirical magazine "Frank" had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP.)
RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT).
RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (GIT).
charity sports organization Team in Training is known as "TNT" and not "TIT".
Institute of Textile& Sciences is still known as TITS.
macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves.
macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy.
expanded, "RARS" might thus become "Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service".
special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself.
of the earliest examples appears in "The Hacker's Dictionary" as MUNG, which stands for "MUNG Until No Good".
some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected.
it omitted the "Communist Party" part altogether, creating "Politburo Standing Committee" (政治局常委会), and eventually just "Standing Committee" (常委会).
the same vein, "Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai" (中国中央电视台) was reduced to "Yangshi" (央视) in the mid-2000s.
can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as "UPenn" or "Texas Tech."
the practice is also common with native kanji and hiragana words.
is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life.
acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial.
capital's metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), "Jabodetabek", is another infamous acronym.
Tol " (Toll Road)"Jagorawi " ("Ja "karta-Bo"gor "-Ci"awi ") and"Purbaleunyi " ("Pur "wakarta-"Ba "ndung-Ci"leunyi "), Joglo Semar ("Jog "ja-so"lo "-"semar"ang).
Indonesian military (TNI— "Tentara Nasional Indonesia") and Indonesian police (POLRI— "Kepolisian Republik Indonesia") are infamous for heavy acronyms use.
that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g.
initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.
Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns.
is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.
letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme– that is, one syllable.
are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions.
pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language.
in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word.
example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of "Việt Nam" (Vietnam) and "Cộng sản" (communist).
example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:
the Gaelic acronym for "television" ("gd: telebhisean ") is"TBh ", pronounced"TV", as in English.
Option Fee"- The initial payment the tenant needs to make.
goes towards the down-payment for the property at the end of the lease.
Payment"- How much the tenant will be paying monthly.
is strongly suggested that the tenant establish an escrow account to ensure the security of his or her rent credit.
Tenant-Buyer and Seller usually agree to keep the property value the same despite house market changes.
the contract is structured in two parts, one representing the "lease term" and the other a "contract of sale".
lease agreement expounds upon what responsibilities the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller undertake during the course of the lease.
the end of the lease-term, the tenant/buyer has the option to purchase the house.
tenant/buyer is responsible for securing the necessary mortgage loan to finalize the purchase the home.
tenant/buyer is released from responsibility for the sale, and the landlord/seller is responsible for finding new tenants.
contract agreements are open source in nature and flexible to the needs of the tenant/buyer and landlord/seller.

program is designed with young professionals in mind, including teachers and junior public servants.
program has produced well over 200 new homeowners in the city.
is the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands.
procedure is used to remove primary tumors or hyperplasia of the glands, especially when they produce excessive parathyroid hormone.
drugs such as Fosamax do not treat the underlying cause of parathyroid-related osteoporosis, surgery is the only cure.
location of the glands is generally behind the thyroid, but there is a lot of variation.
the location of an enlarged gland has been confirmed via a sestamibi scan or on ultrasound.
testing using sestamibi scanning can help identify the location of glands.
can also be used to limit the extent of surgical exploration when used in conjunction with intraoperative PTH hormone monitoring.
particular problem or disease process will determine how many of the parathyroid glands are removed.
parathyroid tissue must be left in place to help prevent hypoparathyroidism
PTH level is back to normal within 10–15 minutes, and is confirmed by intraoperative rapid assessment during the operation.
the remaining parathyroid glands may take hours to several weeks to return to their normal functioning levels.
the number of hours worked in a "normal" week, i.e., with no vacation.
must be placed on calcium supplements to prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia and to restore lost bone mass.
is located between Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier, but also on the axis of Lyon- Saint-Étienne- Albi- Toulouse.
other important nearby towns are Aurillac and Saint-Flour (Cantal), Le Puy-en-Velay (Haute-Loire), Rodez, Millau (Aveyron) and Alès and Nîmes (Gard).
though Mende remains a relatively sparsely populated city (approximately 12,000 inhabitants), it remains the most important of the Lozère Department.
addition, it is the city-centre of the unique urban area of this department.
is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mende.
the right bank, residential areas extend over different causses, including the "Causse d'Auge".
on the axis of Lyon-Toulouse, the city has long been a commercial crossroads between the Auvergne, Rhone and the Languedoc.
city is nestled in the middle of different Causses which form as natural barriers.
over the 20th century, urbanisation began to extend beyond these limits.
1945, this cross was the place of large gatherings in honour of Mendois soldiers.
mount also houses the chapel where Privat, the martyr of the Gévaudan, withdrew to.
its foot lies the area of Vabre where can be found the first remains of houses in the city.
this is the Causse d'Auge (northeast) and the Causse du Crouzet (northwest), and the Margeride mountains beyond.
the west is Causse de Changefège, located between Mende and Barjac, which complements the borders of the city.
geology of the city of Mende is very dependent on the surrounding causses and streams that pass through them.
Mont Mimat and the Causse de Changefège are composed of limestone of the "Grands Causses", thus presenting abrupt edges.
other causses (as well as the butte de Fontanille) are composed of limestone of the "Petits Causses" (without these edges).
the various streams (the Rieucros) of the causses of the north of the city are lined by mica-schist.
city of Mende was built on the banks of the Lot.
most significant of them is located in the Vabre district, close to the first houses.
streets, such as the "Rue du Torrent", attest to the passage of water from Mont Mimat.
is subject to an oceanic stream that comes from the Aubrac and Mediterranean and flows from the Cévennes.
more detail, here are some statements in Mende records since 1985:
is located in the centre of the Lozère department and therefore centralises the roads.
road comes from Balsièges to the west and Badaroux to the east.
road doubling project is underway in the department, bypassing Mende from the north.
doubling is however a long project (1993), having had several outlines and some opposition.
project was finally abandoned in October 2012 making Lozère a department without draft dual carriageways on RN 88.
work of the Rodez- Séverac section should be completed by the end of 2019.
same will be the case for Haute-Loire, which continues its road access.
projects in adjacent departments will reach major cities nearby to Mende (Rodez, Albi, Toulouse, Le Puy and even Lyon).
the economic impact or the absence of dual carriageways in Lozere must be assessed in the medium and long term.
a viaduct (the Rieucros Viaduct) commissioned in December 2009 will be used to ensure a first bypass of Mende.
the expressway from the Causse d'Auge will be directly linked to the A 75.
national road, the RN 106, formerly ran through the city.
northern part of the road was decommissioned in 2007 and now bears the name of D 806.
stretch goes from Mende to Saint-Chély-d'Apcher (and the A75 autoroute) via Chastel-Nouvel.
station is also the starting point of the TER connection to Clermont-Ferrand by bus, which is daily.
its establishment in 2000, it has replaced the school bus service.
urban transport network is also responsible for the management of the pay car parks in the city.
two more major airports with international influence and close to Mende are Clermont-Ferrand Aulnat and Rodez-Aveyron.
was then split into five sections (or neighbourhoods) known as "pans": Auriac, Aygues-Passe, Champnau, Chastel and Claustres.
Pan de Chastel is the old commercial district of the city.
historic city centre is bordered by boulevards which took the place of the ancient walls.
addition to housing, the centre is mostly occupied by convenience stores and artisans.
the boulevards, there are other houses as well as government buildings.
Piencourt" connects downtown roads to Badaroux and Chastel-Nouvel, near the ancient diocese (pré claux and pré vival) having been built.
of the "Allée Piencourt", past the Berlière Bridge, dwellings are present at the foot of the Causse d'Auge.
were established in several instalments over the 19th and 20th centuries, the first of these being Chaldecoste.
city extends to the north in the direction of Alteyrac (commune of Chastel-Nouvel).
these areas and Alteyrac is located the zone of economic activities (ZAE) of the Causse d'Auge.
the Badaroux road, on a hill, lies the Fontanilles district.
between Fontanille, Mont Mimat and the city centre, are districts located roadside above pré claux.
this area are located the centre of firefighters, the Château of Bellesagne and the former gendarmerie.
market is also in this area, but more to the east than the precedents cited (beyond the boulevards, however).
the westerly direction, found the District of Le Chapitre with the sports complex and the holiday village.
the northwest, it is the hamlet of Chabannes, and further to Chabrits.
the east, Fontanille district is on a hillock, circumvented by the Lot.
to the north, is the area of the Chaldecoste (broken down into several districts: Bergerie, Chanteperdrix, Vignette, etc.)
1999, Mende had 5,807 residences for an official population of 11,804 people.
of dwellings have four rooms or more and 20.3% have three rooms.
city is composed of many individual homes, small and large dwellings remaining in the minority.
can partly be explained by the development of higher education, with the branch of the University of Perpignan.
the same spirit, another name circulating is that of "Viculus Mimatensis" (or "Vicus Mimatensis").
is the city which gave its name to Mont Mimat ("mount of the Mendois", literally) and not vice versa.
of dwellings dating from 200 BC were found, ancient Roman "villae", as well as around the city.
on Mont Mimat to Chapieu, a dolmen was found around 1913 including a trepanned skull.
other surrounding plateaux also attest this presence with other dolmens (on the Causse de Changefege for example).
history of Privat is thus situated around the 3rd century, while he was sent by Austromoine to evangelize the Gévaudan.
was during this period that the Alemanni invaded the country, guided by their leader, Chrocus.
Gabali took refuge in the fortress of Grèzes where they were under siege for two years.
bishop, Privat, was meanwhile in one of the caves of Mont Mimat which he had converted into a hermitage.
the Alemanni would leave the Gabali free, by promising them peace.
the 12th century Gévaudan was part of the County of Barcelona.
fact is quite rare because only four golden bulls in six centuries were granted by the Kings of France.
was from this time that the city walls were built.
wished to protect the city and secure channels that lead there.
that time, however, Mende was not provided the civil and religious capital of Gévaudan.
fact the power was always dependent of two entities: The county and Viscount of Grèzes.
Viscount, property of the King of Aragon, was recovered by the King of France in 1258.
bishop had great power as a vassal, but he didn't have the total legitimacy of some Royal officials.
situation ended from 1307 with the Act of paréage between Bishop Guillaume VI Durand and King Philip IV.
it definitively fixed the possessions of the king and those of the bishop, even if some disputes persisted.
the Hundred Years'War security increased with the strengthening of the fortifications and the construction of ditches to 1361-1362.
that time, the chapter of Mende had a castle on the heights of the city, Chastel-Nouvel.
1370 many locals felt safe from the ramparts of the city, despite threats from the routiers.
the walls were insufficient, and could not prevent the pillages.
interview of Mende helped the Florentines to send ambassadors to solicit the Count of Armagnac.
was proposed to cross the Alps and attack the Count of Vertus in Lombardy.
its letters patent, King Louis XI confirmed the privileges for this cathedral, granted by his predecessors, in September 1464.
counter it, the king subtracted La Panouse authority over the city which then became autonomous.
wasn't until 1478 that the bishops found authority over the city, sharing revenues with the consul.
is estimated that in the 16th century Mende was one of the richest dioceses of Languedoc before Montpellier and Toulouse.
among the list of the bishops of the time one can count a number from the family of the Pope.
della Rovere was ordained bishop of Mende, although he never visited in the capital of Gévaudan (practice known as commendation).
they barricaded the gates of Mende, so that the bishop could not access.
vain as the Della Rovere family covered the full authority by notice of the king in 1492.
title of consul was held in place of the traditional title of trustee.
the 16th century, the main events were the Reformation and the Wars of Religion which resulted.
21 July 1562, 4,000 Protestants got within the walls of the city.
destroyed the unprotected monuments and besieged the city by depriving it of water.
withdrew four days later, largely due to being given 2,000 ecus.
1569 to 1576 he held with his troops the fortress of Grèzes where he gradually seized the north of Gévaudan.
night of Christmas 1579, to enter the city, Merle's soldiers expected that the people of Mendes were at midnight mass.
his stay in Mende, Merle made further fortification to the city, not hesitating razing 120 homes to restore the ramparts.
February 1581, while he ruled all the Gévaudan, he enforced the threat he had made to the people.
had in fact asked them to deliver 4,000 ecus, a sum that the Mendois could not collect.
city was liberated on bail that year thanks to the intervention of the King of Navarre.
city liberated, a seneschal was created to ensure the peace.
to the attack of Merle was organised in 1586 against the town of Marvejols, led by baron de Saint-Vidal.
was during this response that the Peyre fortress disappeared from the rock of Peyre.
Tower of Auriac, today known as the Tower of Penitents, was built to accommodate one hundred soldiers.
seneschal gradually took precedence over the diocese, which called for the help of the Duke of Languedoc in 1597.
was after this episode that the Seneschal of Mende disappeared.
was also behind the early educational development in the city and contributed to the building of the hospital.
also made the hospital its heir, allowing it to develop.
1702, the war of the Camisards was triggered in the Cévennes.
somewhat landscaped its walls in order to prevent any attack.
this war which began with the murder of Father du Chayla at Le Pont-de-Montvert never reached Mende.
generations later, the walls were removed (in 1768), "so the air circulates better".
all these troubles passed, the city redeveloped its economy around wool and sheep farming.
city extended a little bit under the development of the appearance of the mills, and its first factory.
1754, Mende saw Louis Mandrin the famous brigand, who lodged in a house there and, according to legend, hid treasure.
was seen close to Mende, once at Pailhou and between Rieutort-de-Randon and Chastel-Nouvel but remained primarily in Margeride.
burghers and nobles opposed, but the bishop finally retained power in 1771.
the French Revolution, Mende had to share with Marvejols the function of department capital of Gévaudan.
was the scene of small counter-revolutionary clashes, but without great effects.

concept of ethnomethodology started with his attempt at analyzing a jury discussion after a Chicago case in 1945.
was attempting to understand the way jurors knew how to act as jurors.
uses this point to emphasize how different ethnomethodology is from sociology and Durkheim's thinking.
sociology, it is more common to use outside sources such as institutions to describe a situation, rather than the individual.
Schütz’s critique of the Parsonian program, Garfinkel sought to find another way of addressing the Problem of Social Order.
order arises in the very ways that participants conduct themselves together.
first inspection, this might not seem very different from Parsons'proposal; however their views on rationality are not compatible.
Garfinkel, society’s character is not dictated by an imposed standard of rationality, either scientific or otherwise.
mentions Schütz's paper on the issues of rationality and his various meanings of the term rationality.
discusses each of these "rationalities" and the "behaviors" that result, which are:
notes that often, rationality refers to"the person's feelings that accompany his conduct, e.g.
means that members shape action in relation to context while the context itself is constantly being redefined through action.
like "here", "now", and "me" shift their meaning depending on when and where they are used.
of Garfinkel’s contributions was to note that such expressions go beyond "here", "now," etc.
encompass any and all utterances that members of society produce.
contextual setting, however, should not be seen as a passive backdrop for the action.
declared that the issue of how practical actions are tied to their context lies at the heart of ethnomethodological inquiry.
the same may be said about rules-in-games or the use of accounts in ordinary action.
ethnomethodology reflexivity is an actual, unavoidable feature of everyone’s daily life.
has frequently illustrated ethnomethodological analysis by means of the illustration of service lines.
knows what it is like to stand in a line.
other words, lines may seem impromptu and routine, but they exhibit an internal, member-produced embodied structure.
topics are representative of the kinds of inquiry that ethnomethodology was intended to undertake.
particular, Garfinkel conducted a famous case study on Agnes, a transgender woman in 1967.
Garfinkel's work, Garfinkel encouraged his students to attempt breaching experiments in order to provide examples of basic ethnomethodology.
following is an example of one of Garfinkel's breaching experiments from his book, Studies in Ethnomethodology.
for Garfinkel breaching experiments mostly are a teaching tool that he describes as"tutorial exercises in Ethnomethodology's Program.
substantial corpus of empirical work has developed exploring the issues raised by Garfinkel’s writings.
inspired by Garfinkel, Harvey Sacks undertook to investigate the sequential organization of conversational interaction.
program, pioneered with colleagues Gail Jefferson and Emanuel Schegloff, has produced a large and flourishing research literature.
second, smaller literature has grown out of another of Sacks'interests having to do with social categorization practices.
Emanuel A. Schegloff used the concept of ethnomethodology to study telephone conversations and how these they influence social interaction.
Jefferson used ethnomethodology to study laughter and how people know when it is appropriate to laugh in conversation.
Manning and George Ray studied shyness in an ethnomethodological way.
on, Garfinkel issued a call for ethnomethodologically informed investigations into the nature of work.
came to serve as an important critique of theories of planning in Artificial Intelligence.
appreciate the sequential development of Garfinkel's thought, however, it is important to understand when these pieces were actually written.
of Garfinkel’s early papers on ethnomethodology were republished as "Studies in Ethnomethodology".
subsequently published an edited anthology showcasing selected examples of ethnomethodologically informed work.
still, a mix of previously published papers and some new writing was released as "Ethnomethodology’s Program: Working Out Durkheim's Aphorism".
latter collection, in conjunction with the "Studies," represent the definitive exposition of the ethnomethodological approach.

2002, it was bought by a Danish investment group, and renamed "Rollei GmbH" in 2004.
another restructuring in 2007, Rollei was split into three companies.
early 2009, "Franke& Heidecke GmbH, Feinmechanik und Optik" declared itself insolvent.
Fototechnik presented two new Rolleiflex cameras and a new electronic shutter at photokina 2012.
of 2015 the brands "Rollei" and "Rolleiflex" continue to be owned by the "RCP Technik Verwaltungs GmbH".
decision to start manufacturing in Singapore in 1970 was regarded as a pioneering achievement by the photographic industry.
it also damaged the companies reputation as a German precision manufacturer.
systems were added to the product range in 1986, and modern digital and compact cameras were included from 1991.
the company rejected his proposal because they thought there would be problems keeping the film perfectly flat.
their current camera range, which used conventional photographic plates, was selling well.
was so enthusiastic he put up 75,000 DM of his own money and went looking for more capital.
he secured additional funding of 200,000 DM, they resolved to go into business together.
need of factory space, they rented several rooms in a house at Viewegstraße 32, which became the companies first headquarters.
house survived World War II intact and stands to this day.
a year, Franke and Heidecke had taken over the entire building.
1922, business was so good that they were able to take out a loan to purchase the property outright.
get the company going, Franke and Heidecke decided to manufacture a stereo camera in the short term.
of this type were popular, and Reinhold Heidecke was very familiar with them.
they purchased several Voigtländer units, and from what they learnt by dismantling them, constructed the "Stereo Heidoscop".
included two Carl Zeiss "Tessar" lenses (f/4.5, 55 mm) and, mounted between them, a Carl Zeiss "Super Triplet" (f/3.2) viewfinder.
had an excellent reputation world-wide, which Franke& Heidecke wanted to leverage for their own products.
camera projected an image onto glass plates of dimensions 45 mm x 107 mm.
1923, the company introduced a "Heidoscop" for 117 format (B1) roll-film.
was from this product, the "'Roll-film Heidoscop"', that the name "Rollei" was derived, which later became the name of company.
had devalued the currency so much that the land purchase cost practically nothing.
the new factory had been built, much was expected of the new camera.
Paul Franke proposed a temporary suspension of further development work because of the catastrophic economic situation.
ruled out a cloth shutter curtain for the same reason, choosing instead a Compur mechanical shutter.
in the "Rolleiflex" was achieved by moving the carriage that held both the viewfinder and the imaging lens, i.e.
camera had so-called "metallic bellows"; that is, the plate enclosed the sides of the case.
of the four small cogs drove rack and pinions (toothed rails) attached to the lens assembly.
system functioned perfectly, and, thanks to high-quality components, also for many years of service.
at 11am on Monday, 11 December, selected journalists were invited to a press conference in the festively decorated production area.
for the new camera exceeded production capacity by a wide margin.
though it was quite an expensive product, orders for 800 cameras were received in the first month alone.
"Rolleiflex" fitted with a f/4.5 lens cost 198 Reichmarks (RM), with a f/3.8 lens it cost 225 RM.
the old factory, a further 23,720 cameras were produced up until 1932.
1930, the company moved into the new factory on Salzdahlumer Straße.
comprised two floors with a total area of 2,000 m², sufficient space to manufacture 20,000 cameras annually.
Heidecke, Reinhold Heidecke's wife, suggested building a "ladies camera"– a "Rolleiflex" that used 35 mm film.
sales were disappointing, so production never resumed after the war.
this was not practical in the case of the "Babyflex" as the negatives were simply too small.
the time production ceased in 1968, over 67,000 units had been made.
roll film was much easier to archive than glass plates.
the consequences of leasing to a Jew, the owner of his studio had already shut off his water supply.
meant that Kahn had to develop his negatives at home, whereby roll film was easier to transport than plates.
built a small "Rolleiflex", the obvious next step was to make a larger version.
the slogan "you see what you get" had already been envisaged for it.
after the failure of the "Babyflex", the company proceeded with caution by initially building some prototypes.
project was eventually abandoned after Soloman Kahn was arrested and nobody else showed any interest in the studio camera.
the 14 prototypes that were built, one still exists: it currently belongs to the Municipal Museum of Braunschweig.
1933, the "Rolleicord", a cheaper version of the "Rolleiflex", came onto the market.
had simpler optics, a steel back-plate, and a knob instead of a handle for winding on the film.
"Rolleicord 1" cost 105 Reichsmarks (RM); altogether 2,699,505 "Rolleicords" were manufactured until production ceased in 1976.
release of the "Rolleiflex Automat" in the middle of June 1937 marked another significant milestone for Franke& Heidecke.
to this, after taking a picture, two separate steps were required to advance the film and cock the shutter.
"Rolleiflex Automat" combined the two, whereby advancing the film automatically cocked the shutter.
also had a film-feeler mechanism that automatically started the counter, so no red window was needed.
"Rolleiflex Automat" won the Grand Prix award at the Paris World's Fair in 1937, which generated a lot of interest.
company founders we so taken with their new creation that they immediately commissioned the construction of a second factory.
was completed in 1938, and by the end of that year the 300,000th camera had come off the production line.
retrospect, Reinhold Heidecke regarded the "Rolleiflex Automat" as his favourite camera.
World War II, the company was required by the Nazis to support the war economy.
also suffered massive losses resulting from its inability to collect monies owed by debtors from "enemy states".
situation, combined with the collapse in overseas trade, forced Paul Franke to reduce the workforce to 600 people.
1 and 15 January 1944, and again on 13 August, Rollei too suffered air raid damage to its factories.
the time the war ended on 12 April 1945, almost 65% of its plant and machinery had been destroyed.
the war, Braunschweig ended up in the British occupation zone.
Heidecke started over with 72 workers, and by Christmas 1945 the workforce had grown to 172 employees.
the company made in 1945 was delivered to the British Ministry of Defence.
difficult supply situation forced Rollei into using lenses from the West German manufacturer Schneider as well.
this was not a problem as Schneider's quality control was equal to that of Zeiss.
Franke's untimely death in the spring of 1950 had serious consequences for the company though.
he proved to be less effective as a manager than his father.
begin with, Rollei had no real competition, which yielded ever increasing sales of its cameras.
the 1950s, almost every press photographer owned a "Rolleiflex", and quite a few amateurs did as well.
camera was so popular that it bred over 500 imitations, more than half of them from Japan.
top part contained a glass prism that was attached to the camera's focusing screen.
were also knobs on top of the housing for adjusting the exposure and aperture settings.
course, a viewfinder frame could also be screwed onto the housing.
initially offered three sets of interchangeable double lenses for it: normal, telephoto and wide-angle.
addition, Zeiss offered two double lens converters which attached to the viewfinder filter bayonet and the primary lens bayonet.
4-element "Mutar" wide-angle converter magnified 0.7×, weighed 437 g and could render an object accurately from a distance of 1 meter.
all cases, for the best image quality, closing down the aperture two stops was recommended.
explains why conversion lenses of this type were only regarded as a makeshift solution in comparison to fully interchangeable lenses.
as a compromise, the company introduced in 1959 the "Tele-Rolleiflex" with a Zeiss "Sonnar" f/4, 135 mm lens.
plans for another model with a 150 mm lens were abandoned.
"Wide Angle Rolleiflex" (also known as the "Rolleiwide") with an f/4, 55 mm lens followed in 1961.
only remained in production until 1967, which today makes it one of the rarest "Rolleiflex" cameras– excluding special editions.
main advantage lay in its ability to photograph large crowds at heavily attended events.
contrast, Agfa preferred the opposite approach, of always developing as many models as possible from an existing camera housing.
"Magic", although intended for amateur photographers, was relatively expensive at 435 DM.
successor, the "Magic II", cost 498 DM and also featured manual exposure control.
the end of 1950s, the market for twin-lens medium format cameras had gradually become saturated.
and more amateur photographers and photojournalists were using 35 mm format cameras, while studio photographers preferred single-lens medium format cameras.
Swedish company introduced their first camera, the "Hasselblad 1600F", in 1948.
this model was regarded as being technically inferior because its shutter was unreliable.
a consequence, sales plummeted and the company got into financial difficulties.
the end, Horst Franke relinquished his position as general manager.
"Rollei Universal Projector" sold for 398.60 DM, plus 97.50 DM for a standard lens.
1963, Rollei introduced the "Rollei 16", its first all-new camera design since the war.
was a 16 mm camera in the format 12 mm x 17 mm with a Tessar f/2.8, 25 mm lens and cost 425 DM.
retrospect, it seems unlikely that such an unusual format might return Rollei to profitability.
"Rollei 16" used special "Super 16" film cartridges with a capacity of 18 frames.
no film manufacturer was interested in making this film format, Rollei had to manufacture the film itself.
roll of B/W film cost 5 DM, while slide film (available until 1981) cost 12.50 DM, including development.
the film simply required inserting the leader into the appropriate slot in the camera.
there was no take-up spool, the film coiled up loosely on itself.
a doubt, limited film choice and availability adversely affected camera sales, consequently only 25,000 units were produced.
Rollei also spent a lot on advertising, this camera did little to alleviate its dire financial situation.
on a film format that Kodak, the market leader, did not support was foolhardy.
addition, "Mutar" wide-angle (0.5×) and telephoto (1.7×) conversion lenses were available as accessories.
help return the company to profitability, Rollei's management sought advice from a number of experts.
then 38 years old, thus succeeded Horst Franke as chairman of the board on 1 January 1964.
promptly set Rollei onto an extremely risky course, which, despite some early successes, ultimately ended in a complete fiasco.
basic philosophy was to explore all possible avenues in photography rather than concentrate on a single product line.
asked to see all the plans for new products so that he could evaluate them.
"Rolleiscop" was a compact, upright slide projector that transported slides via a gravity-fed, conveyor belt system.
slides were stacked one behind the other into proprietary, slotless magazines.
had a capacity of 32 slides (with glass frames), or 72 slides (with cardboard frames).
sized slides could be mixed together as long as their frames were of uniform thickness and not warped.
also increased the advertising budget significantly and reorganised production to improve efficiency.
addition, he laid off 110 out of 120 supervisors and instigated a company-wide employee suggestion scheme.
increased from 24 million DM in 1964 to 85 million DM in 1970.
was a sophisticated system camera, a camera at the heart of an extensive range of interchangeable components.
addition, the lens could be mounted in reverse, thereby enabling macrophotography without additional equipment.
the normal lens reversed and the bellows extended by 50 mm, close-up photography with a magnification ratio of 1.5× was possible.
"SL66" fitted with a normal lens (f/2.8, 80mm) cost 2,778 DM, and several interchangeable lenses were available:
long last, Rollei had a camera that could match the "Hasselbad 500C".
had it been released earlier, around 1960 say, it could have been enormously successful.
a result, the "SL66" never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed.
Rollei owes its survival as a company to the "SL66" camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality.
to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter.
it came with a Zeiss "Tessar" lens with an aperture of f/3.5 and focal length of 40 mm.
important, image quality was not compromised, despite the pocket camera format.
time, several "Rollei 35" models were released; especially notable was the "35S" which had a 5-element Zeiss "Sonnar" f/2.8, 40 mm lens.
also produced the "Rolleiflex SL26", an Instamatic camera with interchangeable lenses.
the high cost of tooling up to manufacture the "SL26", only around 28,000 were ever made.
is more, they invited photographic dealers to Japan to view their factories.
introduced a new bayonet lens mount for the "SL35", the QBM (Quick Bayonet Mount).
this point Rollei still lagged behind the large Japanese companies who already offered fish-eye lenses, super-telephoto lenses and zoom lenses.
1974 Rollei introduced the "SL350", the successor to the "SL35".
state-of-the-art open-aperture metering, which was promoted with the catch-phrase "concentration on the essentials", sales of the camera were rather poor.
comparison to the elegant design of the "SL35", the "SL35 M" was clumsy and unreliable.
mass production in Singapore allowed Rollei to offer the "SL35 ME" at a very attractive price.
1978, Rollei introduced a new, electronically controlled camera, the "SL35 E".
it lacked the reliability that was now expected of consumer products.
a result, Rollei was relegated to the fringe, its sales lagging well behind Minolta, Pentax, Canon, Nikon and Contax-Yashica.
a result, Rollei's customer base, which formerly consisted of enthusiastic amateurs, was now dominated by casual photographers.
they generally preferred German-made products, they were much less inclined to buy expensive camera accessories.
"Rollei 35RF" was a compact camera with a fixed f/2.8, 38 mm lens.
Rollei "Strobomatic E66" costing 548 DM was the first electronic flash on the market, but not for long.
"Strobofix", a similar model without a brightness control, sold for 357 DM.
special feature of Rollei's studio flash units was a modeling light– a halogen lamp integrated into the flash head.
helped the photographer to adjust the lighting and select the most appropriate aperture.
advent of Super 8 film created a booming home movie market.
the meanwhile, Rollei's product range had expanded considerably and it had outgrown the factory in Salzdahlumer Straße.
is more, as Uelzen lay within the economically depressed East/West border zone, Rollei would qualify for government subsidies.
the factory at Uelzen became redundant after Rollei transferred most of its production to Singapore.
site was put up for sale, but no buyer was found and the factory finally closed on 1 October 1977.
was cleverly designed, folding together to protect the lens and the viewfinder.
on, Rollei released a cheaper alternative in silver, the "E110".
models sold extremely well– the "A26" achieved sales of almost 140,000 units, while over 240,000 pocket cameras were sold.
1977 and 1979, Rollei commissioned a little known Japanese company to manufacture a range of three, basic pocket cameras.
1974 onwards, Rollei introduced various 35 mm cameras of conventional design, including the "Rolleimat" and the "Rollei 35XF".
were sold under the Voigtländer brand with different model names, while others were made in Japan.
return, he promised to create 10,000 new jobs by the year 1980.
after the collapse of the "Herstatt Bank" did financial institutions become more prudent in their lending.
"Rollei Singapore" was fully autonomous, it did not do any product development.
1974, Rollei's workforce was distributed as follows: 1,648 in Braunschweig, 314 in Uelzen, and 5,696 in Singapore.
after a long and draw-out start-up phase, contracts to manufacture on behalf of third-parties were accepted from 1979.
would make it possible to restart production in Asia later on should this be necessary.
Zeiss Ikon stopped making cameras in 1972, the company "Voigtländer Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH" was established in 1974 purely to sell cameras.
was, however, no clear distinction between Voigtländer and Rollei cameras, and many models were sold under both brand names.
even applied to 35 mm SLR cameras, whereby their common lens mount was now referred to as the "Rollei/Voigtländer bayonet".
technology was expensive and rather unreliable to begin with, but the advantages were compelling nonetheless.
updated model with improved electronics was subsequently released in 1978.
importantly, these innovations allowed Rollei to distinguish itself from Hasselblad.
on the other hand, emphasised the advanced electronics and ease of use of its cameras.
"SLX" lacked an exchangeable film magazine, although a Polaroid back was available.
"photokina 1976", Rollei presented the "Rollei P3800", the first 35 mm dissolve projector in the world.
product generated renewed interest in the company, because, prior to this, dissolving required two projectors connected to a special controller.
the "P3800" made this effortless, like running a normal slide-show.
all, there was no longer any need to alternately load the slides into two magazines.
"P3800" was made in Singapore from 1980 and cost 1,000 DM.
successors followed; the current generation of "Rolleivision twin" projectors also includes a professional version
"Rolleimatic" was the last new camera to go into production before Rollei went bankrupt.
started in 1977 and the cameras were manufactured between June 1980 and September 1981.
it was extremely popular, the market for amateur photo-laboratories was much too small to make any difference to Rollei.
the new "Rolleinar" 35 mm lenses, Rollei was finally able to match the range of focal lengths offered by its competitors.
top of that, Peperzak cancelled Rollei's appearance at photokina 1978.
Norddeutsche Landesbank (Nord/LB) then appointed Heinz Wehling to manage the company on 1 March 1978.
negotiated a contract with IEC, the"Industria De Equipamentos Cinematograficos S.
São Leopoldo, Brazil to manufacture Rollei slide projectors and enlargers under license.
was now perilously close to bankruptcy, so the search began for a new owner.
chairman of Nord/LB's board of directors greeted this event with the words, "Thank goodness, I am finally rid of Rollei...".
had it that Agfa had taken a share in order to avoid restrictions from the German Federal Cartel Office.
nobody took much interest as all confidence in Porst, Rollei and Nord/LB had already been lost.
Porst was especially disappointed when he failed to gain the support of the photographic trade.
a result, Rollei's turnover declined by 20% from March 1981.
estimated value of Rollei's unsold inventory was put at about 100 million DM.
rights to the "Voigtländer" brand name were sold to the Plusfoto Group for 100,000 DM.
London-based "USH" was founded after the war to manufacture optoelectronic instruments.
initially made contact with USH through its Singapore subsidiary, "Avimo Ltd."
intention was to collaborate in the development of products for the German military.
a result, Rollei began to make 7×42 binoculars, otherwise "USH" exerted no influence over Rollei's camera product line.
collaboration with "USH" proved to be extremely beneficial to Rollei.
products were manufactured in leased premises within Rollei's former factory.
a quarter of the available space was required; the remainder was utilised by companies unconnected with the photography industry.
was a German photographic industrialist, who had owned Schneider Kreuznach since 1982.
in 1995, Rollei was purchased by "Samsung Techwin", a part of the South Korean conglomerate "Samsung Group".
November 2002, Rollei was taken over by "Capitellum A/S", a Danish investment company based in Copenhagen.
the summer of 1981, Rollei introduced the "Rolleiflex SL2000F", a sophisticated SLR camera.
that time it was the only 35 mm camera that offered interchangeable film backs and dual viewfinders.
of this camera began in 1975 and a prototype was exhibited at photokina 1978.
year later, however, the project was suspended due to lack of funding, although it was eventually resumed and completed.
on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013.
improved version, the "Rolleiflex 3003", was introduced at photokina 1984.
system was substantially cheaper than other high-end systems of the time.
was close collaboration with the Braunschweig University of Technology on this project.
there was some revival in interest shortly thereafter, production ceased altogether after Rollei went into voluntary administration.
1,250 gold-plated Rolleiflexes were assembled in 1982 from the remaining componentry and sold as the "2.8F Gold" for 4,000 DM.
1987, a much-admired successor, the "Rolleiflex 2.8 GX", was released which naturally featured the latest in TTL and flash metering.
"2.8 GX" sold for 2,800 DM, which was not exactly cheap, but a reasonable price considering the low production volumes.
then introduced the "2.8 FX" in 2001, a modernised version featuring the "Rolleiflex" logo of the 1930s.
fact, a wide-angled version of this camera is available once more.
the number of Rollei cameras produced increased yet further– albeit slowly– reaching a total of 3.2 million units.
a trend towards rangefinder cameras, Rollei introduced the "Rollei 35 RF" in 2002.
it was derived from the Cosina "Bessa Rx", a rangefinder camera that was sold as the "Voigtländer Bessa R2".
offered three lenses of its own design made by Zeiss.
"Rollei 35 RF" is no longer in production, and it appears that not many were sold.
development of the "SLX" continued, resulting in the "6006" which was introduced in 1984.
improvements included a film magazine and TTL flash metering– superior technology that made it the leading medium format camera.
"6008 SRC 1000" was introduced in 1992, which made exposures of 1/1000 second possible for the first time.
camera is a completely new, hybrid design with both analogue and digital capability.
different versions are available from Franke& Heidecke, Sinar and Leaf ("Afi") respectively.
lenses from the "6000" series can still be used, although the viewfinder and magazine mounts are new.
motor drive within the film back eliminates the need for a mechanical link between the camera and the film magazine.
2004, "Rollei Fototechnic GmbH" hived off its manufacturing to "Rollei Produktion GmbH".
of the bankruptcy assets were purchased by "DHW Fototechnik GmbH" with a view to partially resuming production.
GmbH" continued to manage Rollei's rights and licences from its headquarters in Berlin until early 2010.
latest products are currently available in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Great Britain, Greece, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
GmbH established its first subsidiary in Budapest, Hungary on 1 March 2010.
thereafter, it opened its second subsidiary in Istanbul, Turkey on 1 April 2010.
1 January 2015, "RCP-Technik GmbH" refirmed as "Rollei GmbH& Co. KG".
photokina 2012, DHW exhibited the revised Rolleiflex Hy6 mod2, a revised Rolleiflex FX-N TLR, and the"DHW Electronic Shutter No.
HS1000 ", which was based on the former"Rollei Electronic Shutter".
2014, DHW filed for insolvency and was dissolved in April 2015.

Bates Clark (January 26, 1847– March 21, 1938) was an American neoclassical economist.
was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from Amherst College, in Massachusetts, at the age of 25.
in his career Clark's writings reflected his German Socialist background and showed him as a critic of capitalism.
his return from 1877 onward Clark published several articles most of them edited later in "The Philosophy of Wealth" (1886).
he formulated an original version of marginal utility theory, principle already published by Jevons (1871), Menger (1871), and Walras (1878).
is a dangerous mistake to extol competition, as such too highly, and regard all attacks upon it as revolutionary.
hoped that communism could be combatted by suppression "and" reform:
the adherents of Communism there is a large element that is simply murderous, and this deserves only the murderer's fate.
is possible that an indefinitely large proportion of declared communists in this country may be of worthless or criminal character.
A. Fetter later reflected on Bates'motivation for writing this work:
probable source from which immediate stimulation came to Clark was the contemporary single tax discussion.
Events were just at that time crowding each other fast in the single tax propaganda.
George's] "Progress and Poverty"... had a larger sale than any other book ever written by an American.
and its Earnings ""... wears the mien of pure theory...
one can hardly fail to see on almost every page the reflections of the contemporary single-tax discussion.
the brief preface is expressed the hope that'it may be found that these principles settle questions of agrarian socialism.'
the discussion turns to'the capital that vests itself in land,'...
foundation of Clark's further work was competition: "If nothing suppresses competition, progress will continue forever".
Though the process was savage, the outlook which it afforded was not wholly evil.
survival of crude strength was, in the long run, desirable".
stated it in 1891 and more elaborated 1899 in "The Distribution of Wealth".
same theorem was formulated later independently by John Atkinson Hobson (1891) and Philip Wicksteed (1894).
might have known this Marxian construction from his German time and was reproached for this similarity.
capital are not "produced means of production" each with a different production structure.
country’s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs.
A. Samuelson's classic 1947 textbook, "Economics," disseminated Clark's concept of capital worldwide.

in 1852, the British government passed the New Zealand Constitution Act, establishing an elected Parliament of New Zealand.
government, where this Parliament had the authority to appoint Cabinet, was achieved a few years later.
theory, there was never any law barring Māori from election to Parliament, nor barring them from voting.
major stumbling block was the property qualification, which required voters to own a certain amount of land.
Māori owned a large portion of New Zealand, most of this was held in common, not under individual title.
1867, however, Parliament passed the Māori Representation Act, which created four special electorates for Māori.
creation of the seats was controversial, being opposed by those Pākehā who saw Māori as uncivilised.
the end, the seats were approved based mainly on a desire to improve relations with Māori and reduce military conflict.
was intended that these seats would eventually be abolished as Māori abandoned traditional land ownership traditions.
the end, however, the seats were retained, and still exist today.
Māori politicians defended the electorates, saying that they were necessary to ensure Māori representation in Parliament.
Māori MPs were first elected to Parliament, there were no formal political parties in New Zealand.
the Liberal Party was founded, however, it gained the support of a number of prominent Māori figures.
most prominent Māori to serve as a Liberal MP was Apirana Ngata, who rose high within the Liberal Party's hierarchy.

Peters, elected to Tauranga in 1984 (he had previously stood for Northern Maori) is half Māori.
recent years, with the resurgence of Māori culture, these calls have increased.
are some of the parties which have been based around Māori voters, or which are sometimes seen as such.
Motuhake, roughly translated as "self-government", was founded in 1979 as an independent Māori party by Labour MP Matiu Rata.
resigned from Parliament to contest a by-election under Mana Motuhake's banner, but was not re-elected.
party tried for some time to win the Māori seats, but was never elected to Parliament.
1991, Mana Motuhake joined the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition.
could choose between a left-wing coalition and a right-wing coalition.
the Alliance, several Mana Motuhake members, including Sandra Lee-Vercoe and Willie Jackson, were elected to Parliament.
the Alliance split, Mana Motuhake remained with the hardline faction, which failed to retain any seats in Parliament.
Mana Māori Movement was founded by Eva Rickard, a former candidate of Mana Motuhake.
objected to the decision by Mana Motuhake to join the Alliance, believing that a completely independent Māori party was required.
Māori contested the Māori seats, but never won a place in Parliament.
the most recent elections, it worked in coalition with Te Tawharau and Piri Wiri Tua.
contributed to a widespread perception of it as a Māori party.
similarity of "Mauri" and "Māori" likely strengthened this view, although the words are unrelated.
of the party's MPs were re-elected, and it has since dissolved.
Piri Wiri Tua Movement is a small party based around the teachings of the Ratana church.
Māori Party is a Māori political organisation, and is currently the best performing.

to the impossible trinity, a central bank can only pursue two of the above-mentioned three policies simultaneously.
course, many central banks around the world pursue both price stability and growth.
foreign currency reserves of a central bank are limited, once the reserves are depleted, the domestic currency will depreciate.
all three of the policy objectives mentioned above cannot be pursued simultaneously.
central bank has to forgo one of the three objectives.
Eurozone members have chosen the first option (a) while most other countries have opted for the second one (b).
1997, Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor brought the term "trilemma" into widespread use within economics.
the nation then adopts an expansionary monetary policy to try to stimulate its domestic economy.
involves an increase of the monetary supply, and a fall of the domestically available interest rate.
no capital control market players will do this "en masse".
the short-term interest rates of Asian countries were higher than the short-term interest rate of the United States from 1990–1999.
these reasons, many foreign investors invested enormous amounts of money in Asian countries and reaped huge profits.

when the Asian countries'trade balance shifted, investors quickly retrieved their money, triggering the Asian crisis.
countries such as Thailand ran out of dollar reserves and were forced to let their currencies float and devalue.
law relevant to bankruptcy is found in other parts of the United States Code.
example, bankruptcy crimes are found in Title 18 of the United States Code (Crimes).
1898, there were several short-lived federal bankruptcy laws in the U.S.
first modern Bankruptcy Act in America, sometimes called the "Nelson Act", was initially entered into force in 1898.
current Code completely replaced the former Bankruptcy Act, the "Chandler Act" of 1938.
Chandler Act gave unprecedented authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the administration of bankruptcy filings.
also the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
11 contains nine chapters, six of which provide for the filing of a petition.
other three chapters provide rules governing bankruptcy cases in general.
case is typically referred to by the chapter under which the petition is filed.
under a Chapter 7 filing is the most common form of bankruptcy.
12 is similar to Chapter 13 but is available only to "family farmers" and "family fisherman" in certain situations.
12 generally has more generous terms for debtors than a comparable Chapter 13 case would have available.
recently as mid-2004 Chapter 12 was scheduled to expire, but in late 2004 it was renewed and made permanent.
a threshold matter, bankruptcy cases are either voluntary or involuntary.
voluntary bankruptcy cases, which account for the overwhelming majority of cases, debtors petition the bankruptcy court.
involuntary bankruptcy, creditors, rather than the debtor, file the petition in bankruptcy.
in Chapter 9 cases, commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an "estate."
the debtor's creditors must look to the assets of the estate for satisfaction of their claims.
the revised law, bankruptcy judges in each judicial district constitute a "unit" of the applicable United States District Court.
United States District Courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters.
unusual circumstances, a district court may "withdraw the reference" ("i.e.
taking a particular case or proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court) and decide the matter itself.
of the bankruptcy court are generally appealable to the district court, and then to the Court of Appeals.
United States Attorney General appoints a separate United States Trustee for each of twenty-one geographical regions for a five-year term.
Trustee is removable from office by and works under the general supervision of the Attorney General.
Trustee has other duties including the administration of most bankruptcy cases and trustees.
Code § 362 imposes the automatic stay at the moment a bankruptcy petition is filed.
automatic stay also prohibits collection actions and proceedings directed toward property of the bankruptcy estate itself.
courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void "ab initio").
violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party.
secured creditor may be allowed to take the applicable collateral if the creditor first obtains permission from the court.
is requested by a creditor by filing a motion for relief from the automatic stay.
the bankruptcy protection of the automatic stay creditors might race to the courthouse to improve their positions against a debtor.
run could also result in waste and unfairness among similarly situated creditors.
Code 362(d) gives 4 ways that a creditor can get the automatic stay removed.
the details of avoidance actions are nuanced, there are three general categories of avoidance actions:
actions are some of the most obvious of the mechanisms to encourage this goal.
the apparent simplicity of these rules, a number of exceptions exist in the context of each category of avoidance action.
fraudulent transfer law is similar in practice to non-bankruptcy fraudulent transfer law.
terms, however, are more generous in bankruptcy than they are otherwise.
a fraudulent transfer action operates in much the same way as a preference avoidance.
transfer actions, however, sometimes require a showing of intent to shelter the property from a creditor.
conversion of nonexempt assets into exempt assets on the eve of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se.
is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement.
courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.
practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance powers.
interests, created by what are called secured transactions, are liens on the property of a debtor.
creditors are generally divided into two classes: unsecured priority creditors and general unsecured creditors.
countries are now divided into two classes – creditors and debtors – with the creditors in charge.
priority creditors are further subdivided into classes as described in the law.
time period varies depending on the relationship of the parties to the debtor and the nature of the transaction.
Chapters 7, 12, and 13, creditors must file a "proof of claim" to get paid.
bankruptcy trustee may reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases.
some chapters, notably chapters 7, 9 and 11, committees of various stakeholders are appointed by the bankruptcy court.
some states, exempt property includes equity in a home or car, tools of the trade, and some personal effects.
major purpose of bankruptcy is to ensure orderly and reasonable management of debt.
and SIMPLEs still are outside federal protection and must rely on state law.
anti-alienation provision generally prevents creditors of a beneficiary from acquiring the beneficiary's share of the trust.
such provisions do not protect cash or other property once it has been transferred from the trust to the beneficiary.
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, an anti-alienation provision in a spendthrift trust is recognized.
means that the beneficiary's share of the trust generally does not become property of the bankruptcy estate.
concepts in bankruptcy include the debtor's discharge and the related "fresh start."
example, in a Chapter 7 case only an individual debtor (not a corporation, partnership, etc.)
term "in rem" essentially means "with respect to the thing itself" (i.e., the collateral).
$80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim.
$80,000 portion of the debt is the "in rem" liability, and it is not discharged by the court's discharge order.
liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself.
the extent that a liability is covered by the value of collateral, the debt is not discharged.
analysis assumes, however, that the collateral does not increase in value after commencement of the case.

when society comes to a universal understanding of these issues can the moral dilemma of experimentation on humans be resolved.

consumption tax is a tax on spending on goods and services.
tax base of such a tax is the money spent on consumption.
the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere.
taxes are usually indirect, such as a sales tax or a value added tax.
a consumption tax can also be structured as a form of direct, personal taxation, such as the Hall–Rabushka flat tax.
VAT may exclude certain goods, to try to make it less regressive.
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore this form of national tax is called a "Goods and Services Tax" (GST).
Canada it is also called Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) when combined with a provincial sales tax.
sales tax typically applies to the sale of goods, less often to the sales of services.
tax amount is usually calculated by applying a percentage rate to the taxable price of a sale.
laws provide for the exemption of certain goods or services from sales and use tax.
excise tax is a sales tax that applies to a specific class of goods, typically alcohol, gasoline (petrol), or tourism.
taxes have been briefly implemented in the past in India and Sri Lanka.
form of tax applies to the difference between an individual's income and increase/decrease savings.
the other consumption taxes, simple personal consumption taxes are regressive with respect to income.
because this tax applies on an individual basis, it can be made as progressive as a progressive personal income tax.
as income tax rates increase with personal income, consumption tax rates increase with personal consumption.
taxes, specifically excise taxes, have featured in several notable historic events.
of the first detailed proposals of a personal consumption tax was developed in 1974 by William Andrews.
Liberal Democratic Party government of Masayoshi Ohira had attempted to introduce a consumption tax in 1979.
April 1997 under the government of Ryutaro Hashimoto it was increased to 5%.
5% is made up of a 4% national consumption tax and a 1% local consumption tax.
following prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda "staked his political life" on raising the tax.
taxes do not tax savings, which allows invested assets to grow more quickly.
by assuming a 33% tax rate, the same $1 is reduced to about $0.67 after taxes when earned.
effective interest rate, thereafter, is reduced to 6%, since the rest of the yield is paid in taxes.
a 3% return, most of the tax receipts come from the tax on the initial $1.00.
the tax base will be larger because "all" consumption will be taxed.
critics argue that sales and consumption taxes can shift the tax burden to the less well-off.
ratio of tax obligation shrinks as wealth grows because the wealthy spend proportionally less of their income on consumables.
proposed consumption taxes share some features with the current income tax systems.
a pure consumption tax, other deductions would not be permitted, because all savings would be deductible.
withholding system might also be put into place in order to estimate the total tax liability.
consumption tax could also eliminate the concept of basis when computing the value of investments.
income that is put in investments (such as property, stocks, savings accounts) is tax-free.
the early 1980’s, Japanese households were saving about 15% of their after-tax incomes.
when the proceeds from the asset are spent is any tax imposed.
consumption tax taxes only consumption, so if one sells an investment to buy another investment, no tax is imposed.
necessarily "consume" housing, so they will be taxed on the expenditure of rent.
disparity is explained by what is known as the imputed rental value of a home.
the homeowner is also consuming housing by not permitting renters to pay for and occupy the home.
amount of money that the homeowner could receive in rent is the imputed rental value of the home.
proposes to ignore this method of taxing imputed rental values because of its complexity.
treating renters and homeowners identically under a consumption tax may not be feasible there.
a consumption tax could utilize progressive rates in order to maintain "fairness."
more that someone spends on consumption, the more that the person will be taxed.
rate structure could look like the current bracket system, or a new bracket system could be implemented.
bad news is that those who benefit from the current system are resisting progress.
other words, taxing apples but not oranges will cause apple consumption to decrease and orange consumption to increase.
only possible effect on neutrality is between consumption and savings.
only consumption should, in theory, cause an increase in savings.
an unrestricted IRA under the current system would approximate a consumption tax at the federal level.
economists and tax experts favor consumption taxes over income taxes for economic growth.
on implementation (such as treatment of depreciation) and circumstances, income taxes either favor or disfavor investment.
the whole, the US system is thought to disfavor investment.)
not disfavoring investment, a consumption tax "might" increase the capital stock, productivity, and therefore increase the size of the economy.
individual or a family's income often varies dramatically from year to year.
the other hand, a wealthy individual may be temporarily unemployed and will pay no taxes.

Kishi's group at Harvard University first synthesized palytoxin in 1994.
palytoxin affects every cell in the body, the symptoms are very different for the various routes of exposure.
most common exposure in humans is by ingestion or inhalation.
onset of symptoms is rapid, and death usually follows quickly.
their return from the sea one of the fishermen went missing.
day, enraged by another loss, the fishermen assaulted a hunchbacked hermit deemed culprit of the town's misery.
was clear that the missing villagers had been eaten by the god on their journeys to the sea.
moss growing in the cursed tide pool became known as "limu-make-o-Hana" which literally means "seaweed of death from Hana."
Hawaiians believed that an ill curse came over them if they tried to collect the deadly seaweed.
was then assessed that the limu-make-o-Hana was not a seaweed but an animal, a soft coral (Walsh and Bowers 1971).
palytoxin is such a large molecule, it took some time before the complete structure (including stereochemistry) was elucidated.
1982, this problem was solved almost simultaneously by Moore and Hirata.
structure being established, it was synthesized in eight separate parts and then joined together to form the entire molecule.
2005 and 2006 enormous blooms of these algae occurred in the Mediterranean sea.
is a transmembranal protein, which is found on the surface of every vertebrate cell.
the sodium pump is necessary for viability of all cells, and this explains the fact that palytoxin affects all cells.
is the first toxic compound found to cause formation of a channel.
palytoxin is bound to the pump, it flips constantly between open and normal conformations.
the mechanism of action of palytoxin was so unlike any other, it was initially not widely accepted.
there were some alternative hypotheses, which were reviewed by Frelin and van Renterghem in 1995.
breakthrough research which is seen as proof for the sodium pump mechanism was performed in yeast cells.
cells do not have the sodium pump, and hence palytoxin does not affect them.
once they were given the DNA to encode for complete sheep Na,K-ATPase, they were killed by palytoxin.
early toxicological characterization classified palytoxin as "relatively non-toxic" after intragastric administration to rats.
the doubtful purity of this study increased because of uncertainty concerning the toxicological data.
2004 study discovered an LD of 510 µg/kg after intragastric administration in mice, but histological or biochemical information was missing.
and Munday, 2004) Furthermore, palytoxin was not lethal to mice given an oral dose of 200 µg/kg.
was also found that palytoxin is very toxic after intraperitoneal injection.
number of deaths were dose-dependent and the LD calculated to be 767 µg/kg.
is comparable to the LD of 510 µg/kg referred by Munday (2008).
toxicity was not different if the mice had some food in their stomach.
oral toxicity is several times lower than the intraperitoneal toxicity.
same study also revealed that palytoxin does not affect tight-junctions on such cells.
other mammals (rabbits, dogs, monkeys and guinea pigs) the LD is ranged between 0.025 and 0.45 µg/kg.
lethal dose for mice by the intra-tracheal route is above 2 µg/kg in 2 hours.
is not lethal when topically applied to skin or eyes.
the Philippines people died after eating "Demania reynaudii", a crab species.
eating, people washing, people sleeping, people visiting, arguing, and screaming.
eating the sardine species "Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus" some people died in Madagascar.
these cases people had eaten smoked fish and parrotfish respectively.
are also cases known that persons were poisoned by palytoxin through dermal absorption.
people, in Germany and the USA, touched zoanthid corals in their aquariums at home.
person was exposed to palytoxin via inhalation when he tried to kill a Palythoa in his aquarium with boiling water.
all animal studies, the toxic dose for humans was estimated to be between 2.3 and 31.5 µg palytoxin.
acute reference dose was suggested to be 64 µg for a person with weight of 60 kg.
has been reported cases where individuals have been presumably poisoned from cleaning organisms containing palytoxin under steaming water.
should be taken as the palytoxin can travel in water vapor and cause poisoning by inhalation.
could be related to ciguatera seafood poisoning and thus give rise to a number of symptoms related to this poisoning.
poisoning after consuming clupeoid fish, is also suggested to be caused by palytoxin.
involves skeletal muscle breakdown and the leakage of intracellular contents into the blood plasma.
the fatal cases of palytoxin poisoning, the poisoning mostly results in death due to myocardial injury.
to aerosols, as happened in Italy in 2005 and 2006 (see Incidents section), results mainly in respiratory illness.
studies have shown that vasodilators, such as papaverine and isosorbide dinitrate, can be used as antidotes.
animal experiments only showed benefit if the antidotes were injected into the heart immediately following exposure.

other major cases in the 70s appear to be directly responsible for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.
the first group is exclusively female, the second group includes members of both sexes.
fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.”
1976 "General Electric v. Gilbert", 429 U.S. 125, set a similar precedent for private insurance through an employer.
uproar from these two decisions appears to have directly fueled the creation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by Congress.
2014, a bill was passed in hopes of preventing discrimination.
well as a dismissal, a failure to renew a fixed term contract may also be discrimination.

Warburg was born in Hamburg into the wealthy Warburg family of German Jewish bankers.
the 18th century the Warburgs moved to Altona near Hamburg.
brothers Warburg founded the banking firm "M. M. Warburg& Co" in Hamburg, which today again has an office there.
Warburg established the Warburg family bank as a "global player".
did not want to be a rabbi, as his grandmother wished, nor a doctor or lawyer.

1898 Warburg and his wife took up residence in Florence.
Warburg was repeatedly plagued by depression, the couple enjoyed a lively social life.
most famous Renaissance specialist of the time, the American Bernard Berenson, was likewise in Florence at this period.
also occupied himself with Botticelli’s engagement with the Ancients evident in the representation of the clothing of figures.
rejected a call to a professorship at the University of Halle in 1912.
this period signs of a mental illness were present which affected his activities as a researcher and teacher.
suffered from depression and symptoms of schizophrenia, and was hospitalized in Ludwig Binswanger's neurological clinic in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland in 1921.
died in Hamburg of a heart attack on 26 October 1929.
December 1927, Warburg started to compose a work in the form of a picture atlas named "Mnemosyne".
were no captions and only a few texts in the atlas.
apparent visual magnitude varies from as bright as 3.3 to as faint as 14.2.
recorded that his star 17 Cygni was Bayer's χ Cygni.
had recorded χ Cygni as a 4th magnitude star, presumably near maximum brightness.
astronomer Gottfried Kirch discovered the variability of χ Cygni in 1686.
continued to monitor the area and on October 19, 1686 he recorded it at 5th magnitude.
star was then observed only sporadically until the 19th century.
continuous sequence of observations were made by Argelander and Schmidt from 1845 to 1884.
were the first series of observations showing the minima of the light variations.
the start of the 20th century, it has been monitored closely by multiple observers.
earliest spectra of χ Cygni could only be taken near maximum light.
show weak absorption lines, with bright emission lines superimposed, and it was typically classified as around M6e at maximum brightness.
more sensitive spectra near minimum gave spectral types as late as M10 or S10,1e.
types at different phases of variation ranged from S6/1e to S9/1-e although no measurements were taken at minimum brightness.
emission from χ Cygni's atmosphere was detected in 2010, but HO masers have not been found.
Cygni shows one of the largest variations in apparent magnitude of any pulsating variable star.
observed extremes are 3.3 and 14.2 respectively, a variation of more than 10,000-fold in brightness.
mean maximum brightness is about magnitude 4.8, and the mean minimum is around magnitude 13.4.
shape of the light curve is fairly consistent from cycle to cycle, with the rise being steeper than the fall.
faster rise and bump are common features in the light curves of Mira variables with periods longer than 300 days.
of the supposed brightest minima may simply be due to incomplete observational coverage.
BAA and AAVSO data show minima consistently between about magnitude 13 and 14 throughout the 20th century.
mean period depends on the period of observations used, but is generally taken to be 408.7 days.
is some evidence that the mean period has increased by about 4 days over the last three centuries.
spectral type is observed to vary during the brightness changes, from S6 to S10.
maximum, the strength of the emission lines starts to increase.
minimum, emission becomes very strong and many unusual forbidden and molecular lines appear.
diameter of χ Cygni can be measured directly using interferometry.
show that the diameter varies from around 19 mas to 26 mas.
size changes are almost in phase with the brightness and spectral type.
smallest size is observed at phase 0.94, which is 30 days before the maximum.
parallax is only about a quarter of the angular diameter of the star.
distance can also be derived by comparing changes in the angular diameter with the measured radial velocity in the atmosphere.
studies generally derived smaller distances such as 345, 370, or 430 lights years.
original parallax calculated from Hipparcos measurements was 9.43 mas, indicating a distance of 346 light years.
pulsates, with both the radius and temperature varying over approximately 409 days.
visual magnitude of the star is closely correlated with the changes in the spectral type and temperature.
minimum radius occurs approximately 30 days before the maximum temperature.
also shows spectral lines from s-process elements such as technetium, produced naturally in AGB stars such as Mira variables.
carbon is moved into the atmosphere by third dredge-ups which occur with thermal pulses.
C/O ratio in χ Cygni's atmosphere is 0.95, consistent with its status as a borderline S/MS star.
Cygni is a luminous and variable red giant on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB).
stars become more luminous, larger, and cooler as they lose mass and the internal shells move closer to the surface.
loss increases as the mass decreases, the luminosity increases, and more fusion products are dredged up to the surface.
evolution of a Mira variable should cause its period to increase, assuming it stays with the unstable region of pulsations.
period changes detected for χ Cygni are suggestive of the end of that rapid change from a thermal pulse.
the same period has also been an era of rapid technological change.
period changes between pulses are too slow to be detected with current observations.
pulses on the TP-AGB produce progressively more dramatic changes until the end of the AGB phase.
pulse causes internal instability which triggers convection from the surface towards the hydrogen shell.
this convection zone becomes deep enough, it moves fusion products from the shell to the surface.
is known as the third dredge-up although there can be several third dredge-ups.
initial mass and age of an AGB star are difficult to derive accurately.
with very different initial masses can show very similar properties on the AGB.

bonnet macaque feeds on fruits, nuts, seeds, flowers, invertebrates, and cereals.
southern India, this macaque exists as commensal to humans, feeding on food given by humans and raiding crops and houses.

was released from prison at the start of Japan's Bubble economy.
that time, the Yakuza were all about money and violence.
the Yakuza had any sort of problems they either paid people off or sorted out their problems with violence.
the way Ishii viewed things was different compared to the typical Yakuza.
did not use violence or money to solve any of his problems.
also did not receive money from anyone when others wanted to resolve a problem with him or his clan.

as the Japanese economic bubble burst, Ishii was no longer "the world's richest gangster".
the European Union is one of the world’s richest economic regions.
assets and his health declined rapidly, and in September 1990 he retired as "kumicho".
was replaced by Toi Inagawa, son of the gang's original founder Kakuji Inagawa.

abroad was only done if deemed necessary and unavoidable, given state concerns about vulnerability to foreign debt.
World War II, Japan's return to world capital markets as a borrower was slow and deliberate.
and control remained strong until well into the 1970s, when Japan was no longer a net debtor nation.
that time, deregulation has proceeded steadily, and capital flows have grown rapidly.
movements offset the surpluses or deficits in the current account.
movements include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad).
capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad.
capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.
Japan's balance of payments data, these changes are most readily seen in the long-term capital account.
capital flows in the balance of payments do not show so clear a picture.
same operation occurred on a much larger scale after 1985.

assets abroad grew from nearly US$160 billion in 1980 to over US$2 trillion by 1991, a more than twelvefold increase.
by foreigners in Japan—expanded somewhat more slowly, about elevenfold, from US$148 billion in 1980 to US$1.6 trillion in 1991.
shifts were seen in portfolio securities purchases—stocks and Bonds—in both directions.
foreign purchases of Japanese securities also expanded, the growth was slower and was approximately US$444 billion in 1988.
Japan's current account position strengthened in the 1960s, however, the nation came under increasing pressure to liberalise its tight controls.
Japan became a member of the OECD in 1966, it agreed to liberalise its capital markets.
of international capital flows was aided in 1980, when the new Foreign Exchange and Foreign Control Law went into effect.
principle, all external economic transactions were free of control, unless specified otherwise.
agreement led to additional liberalising measures that were implemented over the next several years.
the end of the 1980s, barriers to capital flow were no longer a major issue in Japan-United States relations.
no policy decisions have been made that would restrict the flow of Japanese capital to the United States.
important area of capital flows is direct investment—outright ownership or control (as opposed to portfolio investment).
foreign direct investment has grown rapidly, although not as dramatically as its portfolio investment.
1970, 21% of its investments were in Asia, and nearly 22% in the United States.
because of the rapid growth in the dollar amounts of the investments, these shifts were all relative.
in the Middle East, the dollar value of Japanese investments had grown.
major reason for many early investments was to obtain access to raw materials.
Middle East, Australia, and some Asian countries (such as Indonesia) were major locations for such investments by 1970.
rising labour costs during the 1960s and 1970s led certain labour-intensive industries, especially textiles, to move abroad.
in other industrial countries, such as the United States, was often motivated by barriers to exports from Japan.
same situation had occurred earlier, in the 1970s, for plants manufacturing television sets.
firms exporting from developing countries, moreover, often received preferential tariff treatment in developed countries (under the Generalised System of Preferences).
short, protectionism in developed countries often motivated Japanese foreign direct investment.
short, the country is becoming a direct security threat to the US.
1985, a new and important incentive materialised for such investments.
rapid rise in the value of the yen seriously undermined the international competitiveness of many products manufactured in Japan.
factor, rather than any increase in foreign protectionism, appeared to lie behind the acceleration of overseas investments after 1985.
northwest and western regions, rural society has continued to be seen as of a low standard and primitive.
needs such as running water and accessible transportation are still very much a problem in these areas.
the pre-1936 period, the CPC played a major role in transforming rural life in areas it influenced or controlled.
card systems channeled unequal degrees of resources, including food rations, to urbanites and rural dwellers.
mostly involved small-scale production, such as the smelting of "backyard" steel.
experimental commune was established in Henan early in 1958, and soon communes spread throughout the country.
of millions were mobilised to produce a single commodity that was symbolic of industrialisation—steel.
25,000 communes were set up, each with around 5,000 households.
backyard steel furnaces were built in every commune where peasants produced small nuggets of cast iron made from scrap metal.
Great Leap Forward is now widely seen, both within and outside China, as a major economic disaster.
often abandoned farming to produce steel or work in other industrial production.
period had a profound impact on the history of rural life in China.
many areas of China, especially southern and coastal China, the standard of living improved dramatically after Deng's reforms.
there are multiple, complex factors contributing to this state of affairs.
instance, distances are much farther, and geography often more challenging, in western and interior regions.
only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well.
in agricultural and rural development is therefore vital to food security and sustainable economic development.
educational and social imbalances are a salient feature of this uneven development.
emerging trend since at least the 1990s is the "floating population" or"black (e.g.
market) people ", rural migrants (民工"min gong") entering urban areas in search of work.
suggest a very high proportion of residents of rural areas are unemployed or underemployed.
development of Special Economic Zones also spurred rural growth in some parts of China.
in itself was an unprecedented display of administrative and political power.
collectivization of agriculture was essentially completed with the establishment of the people's communes in 1958.
were intended to be multipurpose organizations, combining economic and local administrative functions.
the collectivized system seemed to offer few possibilities for rapid economic growth.
economic growth in developing countries is helping to alleviate poverty.
– Rapid economic growth in China undoubtedly benefits the rest of Asia.
experiments were deemed successful and popular, and they soon spread to all districts.
agricultural reforms of the early 1980s led to a confusingly large number of new production arrangements and contracts.
the variability of administrative and contractual forms were several basic principles and trends.
the first place, land, the fundamental means of production, remained collective property.
household became, in most cases, the basic economic unit and was responsible for its own production and losses.
goal of the contracting system was to increase efficiency in the use of resources and to tap peasant initiative.
"specialized households" devoted themselves entirely to production of cash crops or provision of services and reaped large rewards.
overall picture was one of increasing specialization, differentiation, and exchange in the rural economy and in society in general.
increased the options available to individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households.
however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities.
state retained both its powers and its role in the rural economy in the 1980s.
like the collectivization of the 1950s, was directed from the top down.
apparently, it was imposed on communities that had been content with their collective methods.
obviated the supervisory functions of low-level cadres, who no longer needed to oversee work on the collective fields.
cadres in the mid-1980s were functioning less as overseers and more as extension agents and marketing consultants.
new, looser structure demonstrated the priority placed on efficiency and economic growth.
specialization and division of labor were trends not likely to be reversed.
cadres still had the power to impose fees, taxes, and all manner of exactions.
the proper role of local officials nor the rights and obligations of new entrepreneurs or traders were clear.
line between the normal use of personal contacts and hospitality and extraordinary and criminal favoritism and corruption was ambiguous.
past Chinese society, the family provided every individual's support, livelihood, and long-term security.
role of families has changed, but they remain important, especially in the countryside.
members are bound, in law and custom, to support their aged or disabled members.
state, acting through work units, provides support and benefits only when families cannot.
late traditional society, family size and structural complexity varied directly with class.
landlords and government officials had the largest families, poor peasants the smallest.
poorest segment of the population, landless laborers, could not afford to marry and start families.
who produced no sons, or no children at all, adopted or purchased infants outright.
with daughters but no property to attract a son-in-law were sometimes forced to sell their daughters as concubines or prostitutes.
contemporary society, rural families no longer own land or pass it down to the next generation.
families pay medical expenses and school fees for their children.
the agricultural reforms that began in the late 1970s, households took on an increased and more responsible economic role.
labor of family members is still the primary determinant of income.
rural economic growth and commercialization increasingly have rewarded managerial and technical skills and have made unskilled farm labor less desirable.
1987 most families approximated the middle peasant (a peasant owning some land) norm of the past.
rural families were able to achieve the traditional goal of a three-generation family in the 1980s.
were fewer orphans and young or middle-aged widows or widowers.
although possible, was rare, and families were stable, on-going units.
number of traditional attitudes toward the family have survived without being questioned.
is taken for granted that everyone should marry, and marriage remains part of the definition of normal adult status.
the authorities have not attempted to control population growth by suggesting that some people should not marry at all.
the past, kinship principles were extended beyond the domestic group and were used to form large-scale groups, such as lineages.
were quite distinct from families; they were essentially corporate economic-political groups.
most other late traditional associations, lineages were dominated by wealthy and educated elites.
peasants paid as much of their crop to their lineage group as they might have to a landlord.
Communists denounced these organizations as feudal systems by means of which landlords exploited others.
lineages were suppressed in the early 1950s and their land confiscated and redistributed in the land reform.
1987 the party was still condemning ancestor worship as superstitious but had made little effort to end it.
Marriage Law of 1950 guaranteed everyone the freedom to choose his or her marriage partner.
especially in the countryside, there were few opportunities to meet potential mates.
and go-betweens continued to play a major role in the arrangement of marriages.
most cases each of the young people, and their parents, had an effective veto over any proposed match.
the past, marriage was seen as the concern of families as well as of the two parties to the match.
united by marriage were expected to be of equivalent status, or the groom's family to be of somewhat higher status.
aspect of marriage patterns has continued while the definitions of status have changed.
inherited wealth was eliminated as a significant factor, evaluation had been shifted to estimates of earning power and future prosperity.
most desirable husbands have been administrative cadres, party members, and employees of large state enterprises.
pariahs often had no choice but to marry the offspring of other families with "bad" class backgrounds.
have never been self-contained, self-sufficient units, and the social world of Chinese peasants has extended beyond their home villages.
all new wives come into a village from other settlements, and daughters marry out.
villagers have close kinship ties with families in other villages, and marriage go-betweens shuttle from village to village.
1950 clusters of villages centered on small market towns that linked them to the wider economy and society.
villages around a market formed a social unit that, although less immediately visible than the villages, was equally significant.
direction of labor on collective fields made the former practices of swapping labor between villages impossible.
with fellow villagers and good relations with village leaders became even more important than they had been in the past.
provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people.
centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors.
two lower-level tiers made up the "rural collective health system" that provided most of the country's medical care.

eventually drifted apart, and he married Alice Wadhams Hall, an upper class Episcopalian, in Paris in 1924.
late actress Marian Seldes was their daughter; their son is literary agent Timothy Seldes.
was the younger brother of legendary liberal journalist, George Seldes.
the 1920s, he rejected conventional understandings of jazz, film, comics, vaudeville and Broadway as banal, immoral and aesthetically questionable.
did not limit art to its'high-culture'normative of European forms like opera, ballet and classical music.
also did not believe that culture was inherently ordered, or that it demanded rigorous training to create and understand.
sought only to distinguish well-executed art from that which was not.
found'excellence, mediocrity at all levels', and detested'trash'of both the high and low-class nature.
he insisted that the dichotomy between the high and low brow was fundamentally complex.
distinction stemmed from class assumptions rather than a judgement of art's intrinsic value–
his contemporaries, therefore, he evaluated popular culture, introducing new sources like jazz, comics, film, television and radio to criticism.
culture can often be an important source of "soft" power.
praised them for their honesty, humour, and the technical skills of their performers.
anti-intellectual, he was also convinced that art, particularly popular entertainment, should avoid being overly cerebral and didactic.
him, America already possessed its own heterogeneous, democratic and dynamic cultural heritage.
"The Seven Lively Arts", Seldes stated that the language and rhythms of jazz reflected a distinct, home-grown American identity.
had found its'characteristic expression'and had arrived'at a point of creative intensity'through popular culture.
therefore, advocated that American intellectuals not be ashamed of jazz, but reaffirm and support it instead.
this horrified the critics of The Dial, the magazine for which Seldes was managing editor.
response, Seldes was especially critical of American expatriates and critics who favoured European art mediums and scorned American popular culture.
called them the'debunkers', and argued that European culture was not worthy of veneration.
had'foisted on us [America] feeble ideas, questionable taste, quackeries and crazes'.
importantly, he also objected to these expatriates'and critics'assertion that America had insufficient historical experience to inspire artistic creativity.
the 1930s, he became convinced that an historical understanding of America was fundamental to its self-identification.
therefore, moved from art criticism to writing history to prove that America had a cultural past.
the 1930s, Seldes'writings took on heavier tones of American exceptionalism, which increased with the advent of World War II.
the Great Depression, Seldes'belief that entertainment existed purely for its own sake evolved.
called for theatre to reflect the harsh realities of American life–
grew more critical of serious plays, advocating light-hearted content that confronted and assuaged the struggles of everyday life.
the cultural populist, he maintained that American art should benefit American citizens.
wrote, directed, produced and hosted a range of historical documentaries.
the outset, he was convinced that film's essential feature was also a defining American trait.
was its ability to capture'movement, and that happen[ed] to be the one dominant characteristic of all American history'.
therefore, believed that film was vital to America's cultural identity.
the 1930s, Seldes was wary of the transformation of popular culture to mass culture, which television and radio facilitated.
he worried that American tastes were becoming uniform and undiscriminating.
concern increased in the 1950s, as he saw that the arts were monopolised, homogenized, and of poor standard.
the second edition of "The Seven Lively Arts" (1957), he wrote,'we are being engulfed in a mass-produced mediocrity'.
blamed media corporations for broadcasting content that he thought pandered to the lowest common denominator.
Seldes, TV detrimentally narrowed the interests of the public, when, instead–
he also rued how television's accessibility made entertainment seem like a'right', rather than a reward to be earned.
he remained optimistic and wished that the public would criticise the media.
was Seldes'enduring ideal– for American cultural criticism's democratization.
also declared that he did not find sex as entertaining as virtue, honesty, realism, humour and technical skill in performance.
perceived its growing usage in entertainment (particularly in Hollywood) as a reflection of a decline of the media.
later regretted this neglect and he conceded that his material comforts had made him apathetic–
in public affairs has caused me so much regret as my failure to join them.
and during World War II, however, Seldes was completely committed to American exceptionalism.
emphasised the uniqueness of American culture and democracy against Europe's.
believed that Communism was incompatible with America, as it required'complete self-dedication'at the expense of democratic suffrage.
saw Americans during the 1930s as generally apathetic and undisposed to rebellion.
dominated "Mainland" (1936), "Your Money or Your Life" (1938) and "Proclaim Liberty!"
later considered his views during this period dogmatic, pedantic and isolationist.
saw himself as a'constructive'critic rather than a'destructive'one, differentiating himself from the detractors of American popular culture.
also wrote for the "Boston Evening Transcript", "The Forum" and "New Statesman" in London.
the end of the war, Seldes returned to America and became "Collier Weekly"'s associate editor.
January 1923, he sailed for Europe to turn his articles on popular culture into a book.
a letter to his brother George Seldes, he stated that–
the final months of 1923, Seldes resigned his position at "The Dial" to pursue freelance writing.
Seven Lively Arts", his most famous book, is the result of Seldes'sojourn in Paris.
the late 1920s and 1930s, he also dabbled in writing and producing plays and musicals, besides writing columns.
one Broadway success was his adaptation of the Greek play "Lysistrata" by Aristophanes (1932).
evolved along with the expansion of film, radio and television.
1927, he was a film critic for The New Republic, and investigated the working class'especial partiality to film.

was the founding Dean of the Annenburg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (1959–1963).
include "This is New York" (1934), a tourist guide to the city.
explaining its title, he asserted that he was not referring to seven arts in particular–
Seldes'completion of "The Seven Lively Arts" in 1923, he wrote that the central message of the book was
was always a'non-joiner', refusing to join H. L. Mencken's'smart set'or the Algonquin Round Table in Harvard University.
had a strained relationship with Ernest Hemingway, who constantly despised Seldes despite his frequent praise for Hemingway's work.
consistently advocated fair and responsible reporting, and criticised Murrow's intention to disprove McCarthy's credibility.
so, Seldes and Fitzgerald remained good friends throughout their careers.
his later years, Seldes suffered from ill health, poor memory, and emotional distress, which prevented him from completing his memoirs.

Babylonian mathematics remained constant, in character and content, for nearly two millennia.
Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation to formula_1 accurate to three significant sexagesimal digits (seven significant decimal digits).
mathematics is a range of numeric and more advanced mathematical practices in the ancient Near East, written in cuneiform script.
Babylonian system of mathematics was sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system.
Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons.
ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia developed a complex system of metrology from 3000 BC.
2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems.
earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.
clay tablets contain mathematical lists and tables, others contain problems and worked solutions.
compute 1/13 or to divide a number by 13 the Babylonians would use an approximation such as
well as arithmetical calculations, Babylonian mathematicians also developed algebraic methods of solving equations.
solve a quadratic equation, the Babylonians essentially used the standard quadratic formula.
here "b" and "c" were not necessarily integers, but "c" was always positive.
they would use their tables of squares in reverse to find square roots.
always used the positive root because this made sense when solving "real" problems.
of values of "n" + "n" were used to solve certain cubic equations.
could now be solved by looking up the "n" + "n" table to find the value closest to the right hand side.
Babylonians accomplished this without algebraic notation, showing a remarkable depth of understanding.
they did not have a method for solving the general cubic equation.

"Babylonian mile" was a measure of distance equal to about 11.3 km (or about seven modern miles).
measurement for distances eventually was converted to a "time-mile" used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.
method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance Jupiter had traveled in a certain amount of time.
Hipparchus only confirmed the validity of the periods he learned from the Chaldeans by his newer observations.
is clear that Hipparchus (and Ptolemy after him) had an essentially complete list of eclipse observations covering many centuries.
Babylonians expressed all periods in synodic months, probably because they used a lunisolar calendar.
relations with yearly phenomena led to different values for the length of the year.
various relations between the periods of the planets were known.
this knowledge was transferred to the Greeks probably shortly after the conquest by Alexander the Great (331 BC).
