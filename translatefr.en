Earth and nature sciences provide information for habitat characterization of the biophysical environment.
Several areas of biology in its broadest sense have benefited from advances in biophysics.
An approach inherited from physics is used to:
Biophysics intends to explain biological phenomena by the same laws that apply to the rest of the world.
Physicists seek to explain most observations by proposing synthetic theories.
No theory can explain the different national results.
All this requires the manipulation and purification of these molecules using
The re-emitted radiation is also used to locate these molecules in space; this is what is used in imaging.
This often involves coupling the molecule of interest to a biophotonic fluorophore.
A discipline uses these different tools and techniques to apply them to medicine: structural genomics.

Rousseau's political philosophy is built around the idea that man is naturally good and that society corrupts him.
Rousseau is critical of the political and philosophical thought developed by Hobbes and Locke.
However, if he is critical of Enlightenment philosophy, he is an internal critic.
In fact, he does not want to go back to Aristotle, or to old republicanism or Christian morality.
In the longer term, Rousseau marks the French republican movement as well as German philosophy.
For example, Kant's categorical imperative is imbued with Rousseau's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe general will.
The grandfather of Jean-Jacques, Didier Rousseau, leaves this city to flee religious persecution against Protestants.
He moved to Geneva in 1549 where he opened an inn.
Isaac Rousseau, a member of the small minority of Genevois enjoying the rank of citizen, is sometimes violent.
His brother, Fran√ßois, leaves home very early and is lost in Germany, in the region of Freiburg im Breisgau.
Jean-Jacques, who had known until then a happy childhood, or at least peaceful, is then confronted with a hard discipline.
After a few days of wandering, he takes refuge for food from the priest of Confignon, Beno√Æt de Pontverre.
Rousseau falls in love with the woman who will later be his tutor and his mistress.
A shy and sensitive teenager, he is looking for a feminine affection he finds with the baroness.
But during a trip to Lyon, Rousseau, distraught, abandoned in the street The Master struck with an epileptic seizure.
He then wanders a year in Switzerland where he gives his first music lessons in Neuch√¢tel in November 1730.
He meets Claude Anet at home, a sort of secretary-valet, but who is also a lover of the hostess.
The three-man team works somehow until the death of Claude Anet pneumonia March 13, 1734.
"Mom" sent him in September 1737 to consult a professor of Montpellier, Dr. Fizes, on his polyp in the heart.
It provides for the deletion of the scope and replace it with an encrypted system.
He frequents the salon of Madame de Beserval, and Madame Dupin, whom he tries in vain to seduce.
She entrusted him for some time the education of his son Jacques-Armand Dupin Chenonceaux, in 1743.
In July 1743, Rousseau was hired as secretary to Pierre-Fran√ßois, Count of Montaigu, who had just been appointed ambassador to Venice.
His knowledge of Italian and his zeal make him indispensable to an incompetent ambassador.
He enjoys the lively life of Venice: shows, prostitutes and above all Italian music.
But the importance he gives himself makes him arrogant and Montaigu fired him after a year.
He then conceived the project of a great book entitled "The Political Institutions" but which became the famous "Social Contract".
Jean-Jacques must then support not only a talkative woman but also the family of it.
However, some of her friends, including Madame d'√âpinay before she got in trouble with him, had offered to adopt these children.
He earned his living by serving as secretary and tutor to the Dupins from 1745 to 1751.
In 1749, Diderot invited him to participate in the great project of the 'Encyclopedia' by entrusting him with articles on music.
The book is published the following year and its author immediately acquires an international celebrity.
But it is these ideas that will gradually move him away from Diderot and the philosophers of the 'Encyclop√©die'.
He plays immediately after his play "Narcissus", to which Marivaux had made some alterations.
This year 1752 sees the beginning of the Fool's Quarrel.
Rousseau defends the thesis that man is naturally good and denounces the injustice of society.
The work aroused, like the "First Speech", a lively controversy on the part of Voltaire, Charles Bonnet, Castel and Fr√©ron.
He remains fundamentally a believer, but abjures Catholicism and reintegrates Protestantism, thereby becoming a citizen of Geneva.
Rousseau no longer addresses himself only to bourgeois society like court artists or scholars of previous centuries.
During the summer, Diderot struggles to publish the "Encyclop√©die" in Paris.
His friends Grimm and Saint-Lambert are enlisted in the Seven Years' War.
Isolated at Montmorency and suffering from the disease of stone, he becomes gruff and misanthropic.
He won, however, the friendship and protection of Marshal Luxembourg and his second wife.
He remains, however, very jealous of his independence, which leaves him time to exercise an intense literary activity.
The three books appeared in 1761 and 1762, thanks to the complacency of Malesherbes, then director of the Bookstore.
If the "√âmile" and the "Contrat social" mark the summit of Rousseau's thought, they isolate their author.
Indeed, the Parliament of Paris and the Geneva authorities consider that they are religiously heterodox and condemn them.
He avoids Geneva and takes refuge in Yverdon with his friend Dani√´l Roguin.
Rousseau must leave Yverdon and go to M√¥tiers with Madame Boy de la Tour.
M√¥tiers is located in the principality of Neuch√¢tel which falls under the authority of the King of Prussia Frederick II.
The misfortunes of Rousseau have not softened the philosophers and they continue to overwhelm him, including Voltaire and D'Alembert.
Physically, the disease of the stone makes him suffer and he must be regularly probed.
It is then that he adopts a long Armenian garment, more convenient to hide his affection.
Rousseau responds with a "Letter to Christophe de Beaumont" which will appear in March 1763, a libel directed against the Roman Church.
In the meantime he is passionate about botany and has published his "Dictionary of Music", fruit of sixteen years of work.
The letters are published in December 1764, but are burned in The Hague and Paris, banned in Berne.
Il gagne Paris o√π s√©journe in November et d√©cembre 1765 au Temple qui b√©n√©ficie de l'exterritorialit√©.
Rousseau is also under the protection of the Prince de Conti which allows him to receive distinguished visitors.
It was at this time that a false letter from the King of Prussia addressed to Rousseau was circulated in the Parisian salons.
The author is Horace Walpole, but Rousseau initially attributes it to D'Alembert, then suspects Hume of soaking in the plot.
Hume attended in Paris the Encyclopedists who were able to warn him against Rousseau.
The way he treats in his writings Diderot, Friedrich Melchior Grimm, attests to his paranoia.
For a year, it is hosted by the Prince of Conti at Castle Trye, near Gisors in the Oise.
On June 14, 1768, he leaves Trye and goes wandering around Dauphin√© for a while around Grenoble.
He takes his name and settles at the Monquin farm in Maubec.
In Paris, he survives thanks to his work as a copyist of music scores.
In his "Considerations on the Government of Poland", which he then wrote, he condemned the Russian policy of dismantling Poland.
This position increases its marginality, most philosophers of the French Enlightenment then admiring Catherine II.
He continues the writing of the "Confessions" and begins the writing of "Dialogues, Rousseau Judge Jean-Jacques".
In desperation, he goes so far as to distribute to passers-by tickets justifying his position.
It is also the time when he is botanizing, an activity he shares with Malesherbes, which brings the two men closer together.
"The Reveries of the Solitary Walker", unfinished work, are written during his last two years, between 1776 and 1778.
On that date, he also maintains a correspondence with the opera composer Gluck.
Some have advanced the hypothesis of suicide, creating controversy over the circumstances of the philosopher's death.
The day after his death, the sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon molds his death mask.
The north face bears the epitaph "here rests the man of Nature and Truth".
The philosopher is quickly the object of a cult, and his tomb is assiduously visited.
Rousseau's great sensitivity deeply marks his work and explains, in part, the quarrels that marked his life.
Three aspects of Rousseau's thought are particularly noteworthy:
For Rousseau, luxury leads to the development of inequalities and the depravation of morals.
In 1755, Rousseau published the "Discourse on the origin and foundations of inequality among men".
Rousseau imagines what humanity could have been when man was good: it is the state of nature that may never have existed.
This is called a conjectural history based on a conjecture, that is, on a hypothesis.
From this base, he explains how the naturally good man has become bad.
Finally, he refuses the places and the rents offered to him.
To stay free, he earns his living by practicing the job of music copyist.
For Jean Starobinski, the ostentatious poverty of Rousseau has a dual purpose.
Moreover, it is a manifestation of Rousseau's fidelity to his social origin.
The works "Du Contrat social" and "√âmile, or De l'√©ducation" were both published in 1762.
In France, the condemnation emanates from both the Parliament (Ancien R√©gime) and the faculty of theology.
These convictions will have serious consequences for Rousseau insofar as they condemn him to a life of wandering.
Then, he abandons this project because he considers it already treated by Montesquieu.
The "Social Contract" aims to found both political right and the State.
Few things make Rousseau write a book on education.
The book is based on Rousseau's fundamental conception that man was born good but society has corrupted him.
Rousseau divides the education of human beings into five phases corresponding to the five books of Emile.
Three groups of texts are to be taken into account to understand Rousseau's report to religion:
Rousseau is not materialistic (see the "Letter to Franqui√®res"), but he is neither an orthodox Protestant nor a Roman Catholic.
Particularly, Rousseau is an original non-Croat, a doctrine that incriminates the nature of human beings and long-combats.
The writing of the "Confessions" ranges from 1763 or 1764 to 1770.
He writes "Rousseau judge of Jean-Jacques" during the period from 1772 to 1776.
The "Reveries of the lonely walker" are written between 1776 and 1778, until the death of Rousseau.
According to George Armstrong Kelly, Rousseau approaches the puzzle of history in the most antithetic way possible: the moral aspect.
For Jean Starobinski, in a way, the conjectural history of Rousseau aims to propose an alternative story to that of Christianity.
Even if he rejected it, Rousseau explicitly refers to it in note 9 of the "Second Speech".
To think of the human being in the natural state, we must go further and imagine something that may never have existed.
On the other hand, the transition from natural society to civil society can be explained by several foreign impulses.
First, the development of agricultural and metallurgical techniques entails the appropriation and division of tasks.
In addition, extraordinary natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions change the physical environment of men.
So, to avoid the worst, the man must make an unnatural decision and pass a social contract.
In short for Rousseau the State is the way out of the evil that constitutes society.
Self-love allows them to satisfy their biological needs, while pity leads them to take care of others.
Indeed, in this book, self-esteem is the form that takes self-love in a social environment.
So that both the freedom of human beings and their self-esteem are threatened.
Besides, passions and reason evolve, have their own dynamics.
At the beginning, in the state of nature, the human being has only few passions and reason.
For Rousseau, moral truth is the unifying element of all reality.
In the opposite case, reason can be corrupted by passions and turn into false reasoning that flatters self-esteem.
Moreover, his "Discourse on Inequality" is sometimes considered as a dialogue with the work of Thomas Hobbes.
The general will is the key concept of Rousseau's political philosophy.
However, Rousseau doubts that the will alone can lead men to morality.
But for the citizen of Geneva, this identity is not assured.
Rousseau, in the "Discourse on Inequality", argues that natural law can be understood in two very different ways.
It turns out that if there were a natural law, it would have to meet the two previous definitions, which it considers impossible.
It is not a question of returning to the state of nature but of being able to lead a good life.
For this reason, the political right helped by the instrumental reason, must allow the return to a certain form of justice.
According to Rousseau, political society is not natural and for him, man is not a political animal like Aristotle.
Natural law is good for man, political right for the citizen.
The citizen through political right engages in a project to improve the society.
Recent policies to improve rural economic conditions have slowed the flow of migrants to cities.
Participating in a real social contract causes for Rousseau a change of perspective that distinguishes the man from the citizen.
Patriotism is also a means of bonding citizens and facilitating their acceptance of the general will.
We know that for Rousseau men are animated by two principles: self-love and pity.
In the citizen, pity must give way to reciprocity.
At Rousseau, the notion of justice is linked to reciprocity.
The problem is that for there to be reciprocity, there must be equality.
Since the end of the state of nature, natural freedom and equality have vanished.
It is therefore necessary to determine how the sovereignty of the people can be exercised.
There are two possible solutions: direct democracy or representative democracy.
To limit oneself to voting is, according to him, to have a sovereignty which is only intermittent.
The sovereign, the people at Rousseau, promulgates the laws which are the expression of the general will.
The government, by contrast, is a more limited body of people who administer the state under the laws.
It is authorized to promulgate decrees of application of the laws in the cases where it is necessary.
Rousseau fears that, by mixing executive and legislative, the generality of the law will be infringed.
In addition, the citizen of Geneva insists on the temptation of the government to usurp the sovereign (legislative) power.
Rousseau distinguishes three kinds of government: pure or direct democracy, monarchy and aristocracy.
Direct democracy is good for small virtuous states where there is equality of rank.
Rousseau is not really a follower of the monarchy which favors, according to him, the emergence of the courtiers to the detriment of the competent people.
Rousseau deals with this question in Book IV, Chapter 8 of the "Social Contract".
If Christianity spread the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnatural right, by becoming a force, it divided the sovereignty of the states.
According to Rousseau, what he calls the law of the nations and which we would call today international law, is a chimera.
His own plans for a federation of European states and for a valid law of war have remained fragmentary.
This letter is first of all a response to the article in the encyclopedia entitled "Geneva" where D'Alembert pleads for the creation of a theater.
Rousseau feels provoked because he believes that D'Alembert was influenced by Voltaire who owns a property near Geneva.
The court society can be analyzed as a first society of the show.
For him the culture varies according to the people, is particular, not uniform.
Rousseau also opposes Diderot on the importance to be given to the profession of comedian.
Diderot in the "Paradox about the comedian" appreciates in the actors their capacity to play a role while remaining themselves.
Love is reciprocal but financial and social constraints oppose this marriage.
Also, Julie marries Monsieur de Wolmar a good rich man and atheist, thirty years older.
In this novel, Rousseau introduces a separation between marriage and love.
They founded the community of Clarens where there is mildness and moderation.
Nevertheless, in the end, Julie admits having been a little bored during her marriage and not having forgotten Saint-Preux.
The elegance of Rousseau's writing led to a significant transformation of French poetry and prose.
Many writers were also influenced by Rousseau, outside France.
The catalog of the works of the philosopher-composer still includes fragments of a ballet on the theme of "Daphnis and Chloe".
The king then proposes a pension to Rousseau, but this one refuses.
It was on this occasion that the first argument broke out with Diderot, who rather urged him to accept the royal offer.
This statement is based on a masculinist theory, even misogynist, but must be placed in the context of the time.
In France, the Vichy regime was shared in its appreciation of Rousseau.
For this philosopher, the citizen of Geneva marks the beginning of the second wave of modernity.
The first wave begins with Machiavelli and Hobbes, while the third begins with Friedrich Nietzsche.
Another point of disagreement can be found between Habermas and Rousseau.
Rousseau's thought permeated both the French Revolution and the republicanism of the Third Republic in France.
It is easy to imagine that he must have brought the same disorder on a religious level.
Maurras resumes a counter-revolutionary tradition initiated by Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre author of a "Review of a written J.-J.
Rousseau on the inequality of conditions among men ", published posthumously under the title" Against Rousseau ", and Louis de Bonald.
Academics who have looked at the issue have a more nuanced and documented approach.
It is also the pregnant idea that people have the right, like Sparta and Rome, to a second birth.
Further, commenting this time on the "Social Contract" (1762), he adds:
According to her, Rousseau, on the one hand, identifies sovereignty and power and, on the other hand, gives pity a political role.
For her, it is the primacy given to the social question that prevented the Revolution from instituting freedom.
But this emphasis on pity comes from Rousseau, the first to have given importance to this emotion.
As early as 1788 Madame de Stael published her "Letters on the Work and Character of J.-J.
Already at Duguit points the accusation of the Rousseau father of tyranny.
Rousseau influenced Kant who had a portrait of himself as the sole ornament of his office.
However, Rousseau's thinking is opposed to the Kantian idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniversal legislation.
Indeed, the famous Genevan, in preparatory works to the social contract rejected the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa general will of humanity.
For him, the general will, appears only within the framework of the State.
Similarly, for the socialist Jean Jaur√®s, Rousseau is the precursor of socialism.
In Italy, Rousseau was studied by Galvano Della Volpe, a Gramsci disciple.
Rousseau is considered one of the founders of the current "urbaphobe" that fights the big city.
In August 1791, the journalist and writer Pierre-Louis Ginguen√© wrote a petition that circulates among literary people.
The events of the Terror still delay the application of the decision.
The entrance to the Pantheon is made to the sound of the organ, in a "religious recollection".
The ceremony ends with a "Hymn to Jean-Jacques Rousseau" by Marie-Joseph Ch√©nier on Gossec music.
Rousseau Island in Geneva is named after the Enlightenment philosopher from this city.
The island was called √éle aux Barques before taking its new name in 1834.
The following year, in 1835, a statue of Rousseau is made on the island by the sculptor James Pradier.
Switzerland thus enters the "Memory of the World" register of UNESCO in 2011.
Geneva celebrated the tercentenary of the birth of Rousseau in 2012, the event is called "2012 Rousseau for all".
2012 is also the year when the "House of Rousseau and Literature" was created in Geneva.
Rousseau lived in M√¥tiers from July 10, 1762 to September 8, 1765.
The Geneva Library and the University Public Library of Neuch√¢tel have most of his work.
The Mus√©e Rousseau de M√¥tiers in M√¥tiers owns the room where he lived.
The "Combat for Values" movement was founded by Philippe de Villiers, Bernard Debr√©, Christine Boutin and Bernard Seillier.
The MPF merges with the movement of Charles Pasqua (Tomorrow France) and becomes the RPF.
It is also in 2001 that are created the Youth for France, young structure of the MPF.
The party is campaigning for no in the referendum on the treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
The Treaty for the Constitution of Europe provides the solid foundation for our common future.
In March 2007, Philippe de Villiers is MPF candidate for the French presidential election.
UMP deputy J√©r√¥me Rivi√®re supports him by becoming Chairman of his support committee.
After the withdrawal of Guillaume Peltier, it is Patrick Louis, former national secretary to the federations, who becomes general secretary of the movement.
Its mission is to revive the MPF after the failure of the presidential election.
It is in this perspective that the Movement for France joins the European Libertas Party.
The campaign will be led by former UMP deputy J√©r√¥me Rivi√®re (who is however not a member of the MPF).
The Mouvement pour la France is a sovereignist party that places itself in the "filiation of the French Resistance".
Its aim is to "recover national independence in a Europe of cooperation of States and peoples".
The MPF advocates stopping Turkish entry negotiations in the European Union.
Decentralization and subsidiarity are the spearheads of the MPF's institutional policy.
MPF's agricultural program borrows from both the traditional proposals of the right wing and those of the left.
Concerning GMOs, the MPF demands "the application of the" precautionary principle ", by refusing experiments in the field".
Philippe de Villiers also demands a "questioning of the marketing authorization of GMOs granted by Europe of Brussels".
The economic program of the MPF can be described as "economic patriotism".
He advocates a "devaluation of the euro" in order to promote exports as well as a drop in the key rates of the ECB.
Like exchange rate devaluations, tax devaluations have their winners and losers.
Transform the RMA into "minimum working income" (general interest work required to obtain minimum social benefits).
He refuses the social VAT to which he prefers the imposition of imports.
It is in this sense that Philippe de Villiers has created a partnership between the department of Vend√©e and Benin.
Real perpetuity for the most serious crimes, referendum on the death penalty.
Some of its representatives were present at the "marches for life" organized in Paris in 2008 and 2009.
Despite these accusations, the MPF is part of the presidential majority of Nicolas Sarkozy.
"All opinion polls show it, he confided six months ago.
The UMP electorate only listens to those who are inside the presidential majority.
In order for my criticism of Sarkozy to carry, I have to keep one foot in and one foot out.
From July 2009 to the end of the five-year term, the MPF is part of the Liaison Committee of the Presidential Majority
Cantonal and municipal alliances were held in 2008.
On the other hand, the two Vendean MPF ‚Äã‚Äãsenators were elected against a candidate invested by the UMP.
It proposes to the leaders of the Movement the principle of negotiations with the UMP for the municipal elections of March 2008.
His proposal is overwhelmingly accepted in order to root the MPF on the ground.
The goal is to get 500 local elected officials (against 150 elected in 2001).
Following the refusal of Philippe de Villiers, the vice-president of the MPF will not join the government.
From a strategic point of view, the MPF rejects the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãunion with the National Front.
Philippe de Villiers refused the alliance proposed by Jean-Marie le Pen for the 2007 presidential election.
Between 2002 and 2006, about 40% of new MPF members will come directly from the NF and the MNR.
On January 28, 2010, Jacques Bompard and his wife Marie-Claude announce their break with the MPF.
MPF senators sit most often in RASNAG.
Bernard Seillier, former Senator of Aveyron, sat on the RDSE group and did not have to face a UMP candidate.
He obtained his best scores in the Pays de la Loire (4.99%) and in Poitou (3.58%).
Its movement thus confirms its anchorage in the lands of the great west, but does not break into frontist lands.
De Villiers is notably ahead of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the city of Orange (16.31% against 6.39%).
At the end of the poll, Philippe de Villiers does not call immediately to vote for Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round.
He will still call three days later to "block the left."
However, none of them will be able to access the second round (Jacques Bompard misses it).
It will be a failure, the outgoing mayor, Andr√© Gerin, winning in the first round.
This list will be beaten in the second round against the socialist outgoing mayor.
The MPF presents common lists with Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions (CPNT) under the banner of the pan-European Libertas movement.
He sits on the new sovereignty and eurosceptic group, the Europe Liberties Democracy Group (ELD).
During the summer of 2009, Philippe de Villiers (and not the MPF) joined the Liaison Committee of the newly created presidential majority.
This fact will be widely commented by the media and politicians, seeing a rally of the MPF to the UMP.
("We know that the regional elections are approaching and that the two-round poll of this deadline favors bipolarization.
Philippe de Villiers does not show up for the 2012 presidential election.
The duel of the second round ends with the victory of Marie-Fran√ßoise Bechtel with 53.62% of the votes.
Since 2012, the MPF has been represented in the National Assembly by one member of parliament, V√©ronique Besse.
The apple is an edible fruit with pips of a sweet or tangy taste depending on the variety.

Its juice is drunk as is, fermented it constitutes cider.
The oldest statement of the word in French dates back to the year 1100 in the Song of Roland in the form "pume".
In classical Latin, the apple is called "malum" (which gave "mail" in Romansh, "mela" in Italian and "mƒÉr" in Romanian).
The word "apple" has replaced "malum" because the apple remains the fruit, the "pomum", par excellence.
German has borrowed from French the term "french fries", usually reduced to "apples", with [s] sound.
The ancient Celtic was "* ablu" "apple" and its derivative "* abalnos" / "* abalna" "apple tree".
The English "lemon pipin", an old cooking apple, had the shape and color of a lemon.
Its weight is very variable according to the varieties and the conditions of vegetation.
At the top of the fruit (opposite to that of the insertion of the peduncle), we can see the remains of desiccated sepals.
From a botanical point of view, the apple is a complex fruit, intermediate between the bay and the drupe.
Some botanists call "piridion" this type of fruit, typical of the family of "Rosaceae", subfamily "Maloideae".
The seeds (pips) are found in these boxes whose wall corresponds to the endocarp of the carpels.
The fleshy edible part corresponds to carpocarpal mesocarp and to the concept.
The appearance of a white down on the surface of young shoots during warm and humid periods is the characteristic of powdery mildew.
To fight against powdery mildew micronised sulfur spraying is recommended.
Old and traditional varieties, generally much more resistant, can often do without treatments.

The apple is the third fruit consumed in the world, after citrus fruits and bananas.
It is the most cultivated fruit in a temperate environment (source FAO 2013).
The apple importers in the world in 2014/2015:
Thus the 2 countries pass Poland and China which were export leaders in previous years.
France has found two new markets: the Middle East and Asia like to eat French apples.
Following the Russian embargo, Poland, Europe's leading producer, no longer sells its products to Russia.
These fruits come to compete (by their very attractive prices) French fruits.
In Canada, 73% of the apple crop comes from six varieties: McIntosh, Red Delicious, Spartan, Empire and Idared.
Golden (40%), Gala (15%) and Granny Smith (10%) are the most common varieties in France.
Since 2009, the "Apples of the Alpes de Haute Durance" are a protected geographical indication.
The nutritional profile of the apple makes it a fruit quite suitable for athletes.
It is better to chew the apple without peeling, having just taken care however to wash it.
The apple also contains pectin (mainly in its pips).
The gel formed by pectin traps fats, thus regulating cholesterol levels.
Acidic or slightly ripe apples contain a particular form of protopectin pectin.
Remember that these numbers can vary greatly from one cultivar to another.
Apples contain various compounds that protect against viruses, bacteria and molds.
Swallowed seeds chewed or whole in small amounts are harmless.
Only one fatal case of cyanide poisoning has been reported in an adult.
He chewed and swallowed a cup of seeds, extracted from several dozen pounds of fruit.
The phenomenon is particularly marked when the apple is eaten raw and slowly.
Other synthetic products are also used in post-harvest, such as SmartFresh, a cold room aging inhibitor.
The apple is generally less affected by pesticides than other fruits, such as grapes or strawberries.
Baked apples are an ideal accompaniment and dietary for all white meats and sausages.
The main drinks made with apple juice are:
According to Greek mythology, Dionysus created it to offer it to Aphrodite, his mistress.
For this reason, the apple became the symbol of the goddess of love.

The spherical shape of the apple also made her a cosmic symbol.
Although it is the second largest town in the Channel after Cherbourg, it remains the prefecture of the department.
It is also the chief town of a district and two cantons (Saint-L√¥-1- Saint-L√¥-2).
This historic heart of the city has become "L'Enclos", a site well suited to passive defense.
The east of the territory is the former municipality of Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L√¥, the south that of Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-L√¥, absorbed in 1964.
Saint-L√¥ enjoys the mild oceanic climate characterized by mild winters and temperate summers.
There are 30 to 40 days of freezing a year.
The southern section now connects Saint-L√¥ directly to the A84 motorway, allowing motorway access to Caen and Rennes.
It has also enabled the creation and extension of new business areas that contribute significantly to the current growth of the agglomeration.
The station of Saint-L√¥ is served by TER trains of the Caen-Rennes relationship.
Most of these are passenger connections to Caen via Lison or to Coutances.
A few trains - two daily round trips - go as far as Rennes via Avranches.
This experience was not sustained due to a lack of passengers.
There is also the old industrial line (disused) to Cond√©-sur-Vire.
Urban transport is provided by the "Transports Urbains Saint-L√¥ Agglom√©ration": TUSA (formerly Transports Urbains Saint-L√¥ Agneaux), created in 1980.
The old Renault PR 100.2 (No. 97205, 97207 to 97210) and Renault PR 112 (No. 97211 and 97212) were scrapped.
The town is associated with the public transport by coach (Man√©o) by lines:
Despite its prefecture status, there is no aerodrome in the vicinity of the municipality.
River transport on the Vire has existed with gabars ensuring the transport of the pitch.
It is no longer possible, for lack of maintenance of the various equipment and the Vire.
It has thus attracted the greed of neighboring peoples, especially the English, resulting in numerous successive invasions.
The decentralization policy, however, allows the city to return to the forefront.
The Franks only established an administrative power, Briov√®re nevertheless having the right to coin money.
The church of St. Croix was built in 300 on the ruins said to be a temple of Ceres.
Christianity develops rather late; there are only four bishops of Coutances before 511.
The Britons led by King Solomon, began to occupy the west coast of Cotentin from 836.
Protected by solid ramparts built a century earlier by Charlemagne, the city does not surrender.
The attackers then cut the water supply, resulting in the surrender of the inhabitants.
The Vikings massacred the inhabitants, including the bishop of Coutances, then razed the city.
It was only in 1025 that Bishop Herbert decided to go up the walls of St. Lo and restore the episcopal seat.
Then, under Geoffroy de Montbray, the city knows a great economic boom, taking advantage of the Normans' expedition to Sicily.
The population of the region participated in the conquest of England.
In 1091, Geoffroy de Montbray Bishop of Coutances had a lock and mills built on the Vire river.
Saint-L√¥ sided with √âtienne but was taken in 1139 by the army of Plantagen√™t in just three days.
St. Louis comes to the city twice, in 1256 and 1269.
Saint-L√¥ is then the third city of Normandy behind Rouen and Caen.
She specializes in tanneries with the name of leather called "cow of Saint-L√¥".
In January 1538, the letter "C" is attributed to him.
The city was dispossessed of its monetary title in September 1693, in favor of Caen.
Then it is the return of the conflicts with the Hundred Years War.
Geoffroy d'Harcourt, knight with franchises in the Nord-Cotentin, betrays the King of France and pays tribute to Edward III.
In this period of political turmoil, the little lords no longer know who to support.
The period of peace was back but the Cotentin lost its importance.
Saint-L√¥ had a Reformed church since 1555 and the first printed books will be Protestant works.
The city is ceded to James II of Matignon who built the citadel.
As a result, Saint-L√¥ loses in 1580, the seat of the presidial, transferred to Coutances, capital of the bailiwick.
The revolt of the barefooters shook the region a little in 1636, when the government wanted to extend the gabelle to the Cotentin.
The region prospered mainly in the manufacture of so-called "estame" socks.
In 1678, the relics of Saint Laud are brought back to Notre-Dame.
The royal road between Paris and Cherbourg, built around 1761, passes to Saint-L√¥, facilitating trade.
The city is relatively spared during the regime of the Terror and there are only some clashes with the Chouans.
The Napoleonic period saw the creation of the National Stud ("see below").
In 1827, Maria Theresa of France, Duchess of Angouleme, passed through Saint-Lo and was struck by the beauty of the landscape.
She then planned to bring the sea to Saint-L√¥ by making the Vire navigable.
The creation of the canal of Vire and Taute in 1833 made it possible to establish the connection between Carentan and Saint-L√¥.
Then, by order of July 10, 1835, the Vire was classified as navigable.
Several goods are transported but mainly the pitch and lime from the quarries of Pont-H√©bert and Cavigny.
In 1867, the Valvire paper mill was built near the spillway and made kraft paper.
It was destroyed by a fire in 1930 and from the factory there remains only the chimney.
There was also a leak in the canal and the Vire was decommissioned in 1926.
The stationery of Valvire burned in the thirties and will never be rebuilt.
The demography of the department is very negative from 1850.
The city approaches the Second World War in a declining situation.
In March 1943, the Germans decided to dig an underground under the rock.
Workers from the STO will be required until the beginning of the Battle of Normandy.
Then, the underground, under construction, will welcome the patients of the hotel-Dieu located directly opposite and a part of the Saint-loise population.
During the Liberation, Saint-L√¥ suffered two attacks during the Battle of Normandy.
The city was this time bombed by the Germans who maintained their position to the south.
The city will be 90% destroyed and will be nicknamed "The Capital of the Ruins".
It is Samuel Beckett who will popularize this expression, in a poem of 1946.
This is the reason that pushed the prefect of the ruins √âdouard Lebas to settle in Coutances.
The Notre-Dame church on the ramparts still bears the stigmata of the bombings and bloody clashes that took place.
In April 1945, the Minister of Reconstruction Raoul Dautry recommended the construction of temporary wooden barracks.
The barracks were delivered in kit and it was enough to mount them on the spot.
Each had different specificities depending on their origin (Swedish, Finnish, Swiss, French, American, Canadian).
President Vincent Auriol laid the foundation stone four years after the landing.
The Americans, at the origin of the bombing, decide to build a modern hospital.

On November 29, 1949, the journalist Fr√©d√©ric Pottecher submits the hypothesis of not moving the prefecture of La Manche to Saint-L√¥.
It must be said that during the reconstruction, it is placed temporarily in Coutances.
The prefecture will return to Saint-L√¥ in 1953 in new premises.
The dominant style is a functionalist neo-regionalism where concrete dominates.
The town benefits from the economic boom of the Thirty Glorious and the population increases by 30% between 1968 and 1975.
Building blocks are being built in the Doll√©e and Val Saint-Jean valley.
The Town Hall Square is completely refurbished in the 1990s.
The city organizes on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the landing a large demonstration.
A barge has been rebuilt and crisscrosses the river, as if to remember the old river activity.
Its elevation allows, therefore, a point of implantation of telecommunication networks (mobile phone, Wimax, and FM radio).
The distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is, in 2007, the following:
The city, crossroads between Caen, Cherbourg and Rennes has a natural vocation of market place in the center of the manchois grove.
Despite this, the country saint-laws has become one of the least industrial basins of the region.
Industrial clusters have been established in different regions of the country whose networks can offset rising costs.
Its unemployment rate of 6.7% also hides an exodus of young workers to the region of Caen and Rennes.
Similarly, the unemployment rate in Spain exceeds 25% (and 55% for young people).
In Greece, the youth unemployment rate now exceeds 60%, and in Spain 50%.
The youth unemployment rate is also an underestimated indicator, rising to an alarming level.
Businesses should have access to this throughput in September 2008 and individuals not until September 2009.
Saint-L√¥ will therefore be one of the first cities in France of this size to be equipped with a fiber optic internet network.
There are many jobs in the administrations related to its prefecture status.
Finally, many businesses have developed along the ring road.
The city hosts activities related to the breeding of cattle and horses.
Every week, a market with calves was held in the party until December 30, 2008 near the Ronchettes.
It is removed and attached from January 2009 to the calf market of Torigni-sur-Vire.
Several regional media are distributed in Saint-L√¥ and have an agency.

Saint-L√¥ was the place of various garrisons in the Bellevue Barracks:
The Sports Union Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-L√¥ is evolving a football team in the league of Basse-Normandie and two others in district divisions.
It is located in the enclosure surrounded by the ramparts and is registered on the register of historical monuments since 1840.
The building suffered heavy destruction during the Second World War.
Saint-L√¥ Cemetery is located between St. Croix Church and the Haras, at the Lison Road.
We still find the vault of the General of the French Revolution Dagobert.
Note also the statue representing a Pleureuse, bronze sculpture of Cabet, student of F.
The city also has a Protestant church of the Reformed Church of France.
It was built by the architect Verrey with glassmaker Max Ingrand and was inaugurated on October 23, 1955.
This bourgeois building featured a half-timbered facade with corbels and sculptures.
The stud then recruited breeding stock from Haras du Pin.
On June 28, 1881, the city council decided to transfer the stud farm to the edge of the Bayeux road.
During the First World War, five mares out of six will be requisitioned, but no stallion.
The grooms fought on the front and German prisoners dug a pond.
In 1939, the old stud farm housed the Haras de Strasbourg (40 stallions and staff) at the time of the German breakthrough.
Then, in 1944, fifty horses were killed by bombing and other stallions were stolen by fleeing German soldiers.
Thus, the district of Saint-L√¥ has the highest density of breeding depots in France.
The dovecote and the north battlements are identified as protected elements.
Built by the architect Eug√®ne Leseney, the Jean-Lur√ßat Cultural Center is located on the Champ-de-Mars square, in front of the Sainte-Croix church.
La Chapelle de la Madeleine is located right next to the national stud farm, on the road to Bayeux.
Photos, commemorative plaques, paintings and flags are on display.
Remodeled in 1990, the place is all black bitumen lit by spots on the ground.
You can see at the top of the square the statue of the dairy or "Woman Isigny".

She moved a little further when the Hairy of the Great War was installed.
Then, it was deboulonn√© and melted on February 8, 1942 by the Germans to recover the bronze for the industry of armament.
In January 1984, Andr√© Leplanquais, a merchant saint-laws, wanted to create a new replica of this statue.
A fundraiser generated significant donations from residents.
Once the money collected, the sculptor Louis Derbr√© famous sculptor Ern√©e (Mayenne) fashioned a new statue from original plans.
Several times moved, it can be found near the stairs of the square.
Next door is the prison gate, remains of the bombings of 1944.
An urn containing ashes of deportees is placed at the foot of it.
Memorial in honor of the victims of the Nazi repression, it became the departmental monument of the Resistance.
One can also observe on the square the belfry that seems to spring from the heart of the city.
Built in 1954, where and faisait autrefois s√©cher les tuyaux des pompiers.

Civil and political rights were extended to the working class.
On the other hand, strong regimes and empires are more difficult.
The police fired on the demonstrators, the repression made 15 to 33 dead.
Deep disputes that the war has exacerbated or created will quickly lead to the failure of international negotiations.
The problem of financial and energy reparation undermined international relations from the end of the war until 1929.
On this date, Owen D. Young chairs the second renegotiation of the Treaty of Versailles.
The second agreement will also be obsolete, the crisis of 1929 having occurred.
The issue of war reparations highlights the potential weakness of economies.
To pay off debts, governments raise taxes and borrowings, limiting prospects for economic recovery through consumption.
The laws of 1916 and 1918 use taxes as an essential source of income.
The top marginal tax rate is 90%, compared with only 2% ten years ago.
In England, too, the Finance Act of April 29, 1910 instituted a tax on the capital gain.
During the war, gold convertibility ends and the use of bank notes is made compulsory.
If prices remain relatively stable, prices rise sufficiently to generate hoarding of metal currencies.
Non-convertibility is thus preserved, in the hope, disappointed, of a return to the previous situation.
All states massively produce money, which generates inflation.
The German state inaugurates the "devaluation of combat", to favor its exports.
In December 1921, this ratio was one for 46 and in August 1923, one for one trillion.
The three main growth factors of the 1920s were rationalization, concentration and technological progress.
The United Kingdom owes 4661 million to the United States, which no longer has any debt but claims.
In France, the index of industrial production quadrupled in ten years: it went from 57 to 239 between 1919 and 1929.
Its electricity production is multiplied by 4 or 8, according to different estimates, and that of automobile by five.
The dynamism of large companies is also found at the level of "large SMEs" (companies with 10 to 500 employees).
Services also progress, whether marketed or not, as well as education.
In five years, from 1928 to 1933, we move from paid secondary education to free education.
Even though it is lagging behind other countries, Britain is also showing strong growth.
In Britain, economic growth is even slower, and inflation is much higher.
First nation to enter the industrial revolution but its old industries are struggling to renew themselves.
US industrial production increased by only 50% over the period.
In 1922 is created the Gold Exchange Standard (GES) initiative to solve a general problem of gold hedging currencies.
This mechanism will last until the crisis of 1929 allowing a relative stability of European currencies and Germany seeing its exports facilitated.
The United States is once again the architects of German recovery.
In collaboration with Hjalmar Schacht, the "wizard of finance", the Americans concede major loans to Germany.
These monetary disorders mean that international trade remains more than modest, despite the strong global economic growth.
Economic growth must be strong and sustainable. But it must above all be global.
The outlook for 2007, however, is one of slowing global economic growth.
It is obvious that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use.
The name Georgia comes from the name of King George II of England (George Augustus, King of Great Britain and Ireland 1683-1760).
The local culture of the Mound Builders, described by Hernando de Soto in 1540, completely disappeared in 1560.

The conflict with the Spaniards is revived by the founding of the new colony that Madrid considers illegal.
Subsequently, Georgia became one of thirteen colonies to revolt against the British during the American Revolutionary War.
Georgia imported many slaves of different African ethnicities for its rice and cotton plantations.
Slaves of the same ethnicity will be separated, which will facilitate the penetration of the English language, Christianized and renamed.
These will most often be deported by English and French slavers, the main maritime powers at that time.
Several dozen white families live from this time around the montfort.
From 1790, the share of blacks in the population increases from one third to two thirds.
In December 1864 the industrial and railway center of Atlanta was completely destroyed by the northern army of General William Tecumseh Sherman.
His troops sack the countryside between Atlanta and the port city of Savannah; they take Savannah just before Christmas 1864.
It is the largest state in the country east of the Mississippi River.
Many rivers flow through Georgia; we find:
The Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area alone accounted for 54.6% of the state's population.
In 2010, the Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs combined metropolitan area alone accounted for 61.0% of the state's population.
Its population accounted for 3.14% of the country's population.
The state's population center was located in northeastern Butts County.
The urban rate was 75.1% and the rural rate was 24.9%.
The fertility rate was 1.96 children per woman (1.88 in 2012).
The Native Americans identified themselves as Cherokees (16.3%), Amerindians of Mexico (8.0%) and Creeks (3.0%).
From 1824 to the Civil War, Georgia is a state that alternates between the Democrats and the Whigs.
The Republican party, that of Lincoln, is considered the party of the victors of the Civil War and the Yankees.
During this time, Georgia is a segregationist state where reigns Ku Klux Klan and Dixiecrats.
Civil rights laws in the 1960s begin to undermine the preponderance of democracy.
Like many former southern states, Georgia has lived a one-party regime for a hundred years.
The governor of the state, elected for 4 years, is today Nathan Deal, the second Republican to occupy this position since 1872.
He succeeded in January 2011 to Sonny Perdue, the first Republican elected governor of Georgia in 130 years.
The lieutenant governor, elected for four years, is Republican Casey Cagle.
All the elected positions of the executive ("attorney", treasurer, secretary of state), during the legislature 2011-2013, are held by Republicans.
The two chambers of the General Assembly of Georgia are dominated since 2002 by the Republicans.
Georgia is a state favorable to the death penalty.
The minimum legal age to be sentenced to death is 17 years.
In September 2011, there were 113 prisoners sentenced to death.
These commissions can even sentence detainees to death without their being able to appeal to a civilian court.
Before September 2011, five people were cleared, and six were granted a pardon.
The hit film "Gone With The Wind" is set in Georgia.
The protagonists of the film are from the southern high society and have large plantations of cotton.
In the 1960s, Ray Charles refused to return to play in Georgia because of the segregation then prevailing.
However, in 1979, his song "Georgia on My Mind" was adopted as the official anthem of the state ("state song").
They leave this state only at the end of season 5, when the group arrives in Washington.
His parents had met at the Baku industrial laboratory (Azerbaijan) where they worked as engineers.
Kim's father Mo√Øsse√Ø (died 1971) was a composer and conductor.
Kim Va√Ønstein's younger brother, L√©onide Va√Ønstein, was a composer in Azerbaijan.
Garik's father, opposed to learning music, taught him chess when he was five years old.
His father became ill in the summer of 1970 and died in 1971, at the age of thirty-nine, of Hodgkin's lymphoma.
His maternal grandfather, Chaguen, an oil worker and fervent communist, retired in 1971 and took care of Garik.
In September 1970, she was in Moscow, where her father was hospitalized.
Garik's uncles, Leonid Vainnstein and Konstantin Grigorian, enroll him in the chess circle of the Baku Pioneers' Palace.
At the end of the year, Garik attains the rank of third-ranked player.
In 1972, he gives a simultaneous part against Baku oil workers.
For this result, Garik received the rank of first-class player at age nine.
In January 1973, he finished third in the Baku Junior Championship.
In March 1973, he scored four out of four points on a tour of the Azerbaijani junior team in Latvia and Estonia.
Kasparov follows the courses of the former world champion Nikitine and Mark Dvoretski, specializing in matchmaking.
Other masters contribute to his formation, as Alexander Ivanovich Chakarov, among others in the field of openings.
In 1975, still under the name of Va√Ønstein, Garik finished seventh in the junior USSR championship (players under 18).
The name change to Garri Kasparov occurs in August 1975, during a council of the families Va√Ønstein and Kasparov.
As early as 1974, with Botvinnik's agreement, Garik had begun talking about it with his mother.
In 1976, the Soviet Union boycotted the Haifa Chess Olympiad, when it sent its team to Tel Aviv in 1964.
However, the Soviet authorities refuse to let Kasparov go to the United States and FIDE declares that he loses by default.
In January 1984, Kasparov took first place in the Elo standings, ahead of world champion Anatoli Karpov.
After the 1985 match, Anatoly Karpov was entitled to a rematch the following year.
At the end of the year, the two opponents play their fourth game in four years, this time in Seville.
Kasparov equalizes (+4 = 16-4) in the twenty-fourth and last part.
Depending on the conditions of the match, in case of a tie (12-12) the world champion retains his title.
Three years later, in 1990 in New York and Lyon, Kasparov found Karpov.
Two games before the end of the match, Kasparov was sure to retain his title.
The last two games were contested to decide the prize distribution, final score: 12.5-11.5 (+4 = 17-3).
In 1993, Kasparov founded the Professional Chess Association (PCA) with the winner of the FIDE Candidate Tournament, the British Nigel Short.
Kasparov later admitted that this separation from FIDE was a serious mistake.
In 2008, during the Corsican Circuit, the five hundred rounds were played simultaneously and won 5-0.
Kasparov beats him in the tiebreakers: 4-1 (+3 = 2).
He loses the first part of the match, wins three then cancels the others.
In 1987, Kasparov was elected to Komsomol, the youth organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
He has links with think circles of the same faith, such as the Hudson Institute.
Kasparov takes part in the electoral campaign of Boris Yeltsin in 1996.
In 2005, Kasparov abandoned the chess competition after his ninth victory at the Linares tournament.
Founder of the Unified Civic Front, he is one of the leaders of the "Other Russia" movement, a coalition of opponents of Vladimir Putin.
He was briefly arrested during a demonstration of the movement in Moscow on April 14, 2007.
Since then, his political commitment in opposition to President Vladimir Putin, Kasparov is worried about his life.
For example, he has five bodyguards permanently and no longer travels with the national airline Aeroflot.
Kasparov is also a defender of the historical theory of the "New Chronology" of the Russian academician Anatoly Fomenko.
On December 12, he announced his withdrawal from the presidential race, considering himself ostracized.
According to them, it risks isolating Russia on the international scene.
On December 13, 2008, Kasparov announces the birth of his new political party: Solidarnost.
The party brings together members of the Union of Right Forces as well as supporters of former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir fell into this category.
The main goal of the new prime ministers and cabinet members is to return to their popular parties.
He wins two games, loses three more and makes three draws.
He took his revenge in February 1987, winning six games and conceding only two draws.
In Amsterdam, Kasparov finished third with Karpov, ahead of Nigel Short and Valery Salov.

Kasparov won the Linares tournament nine times in fourteen times, including four consecutive wins from 1999 to 2002.
The 1995 edition was the only one where Kasparov was absent from 1990 when he retired in 2005.
With each participation of Kasparov at the chess olympics, his team wins the team gold medal.
In December 1988, he participated in a charity match USSR-Rest of the World, played in quick games in Madrid.
He scored 5.5 points out of 8 (+3 = 5) and the USSR (without Karpov) won the match.
In 2002, a match Russia-Rest of the World is organized in Moscow in quick games.
Kasparov finished with a negative score: 4 out of 10 points (+ 1-3 = 6) and the Russian team lost the match.
In 1992, in the first chessboard of Russia, he scored 6 points out of 8 (+4 = 4).
Kasparov wins each time the team gold medal and an individual gold medal.
In 1992, he achieved the second best Elo performance of the European Championship behind Vladimir Kramnik who played in the third chessboard.
In October or November 1975, at the age of twelve, Kasparov won the Baku Cup in quick games.
In 1994, he finished first-second, tied with Vladimir Kramnik, of the Intel Grand Prix 1994 fast.
The tournament in Paris was double, but Kramnik is declared the winner of the 1994 grand prix at the tie breaker.
Gary Kasparov won his games with extreme preparation at the opening level.
He is still regarded as the best prepared player in the world of all time in this regard.
Here is Kasparov's opening repertoire at the height of his glory:
(the most aggressive shot, but also the most risky, 10 ... Fg4 is safer) 11.
Fxb3 Cd4 (Anand's reflection time to play this shot: almost an hour) 17.
Kasparov's style was marked by many sacrifices, as shown in the following section:

Judit Polg√°r does not protest, believing there were no witnesses.
He creates a new incident during the closing ceremony, while the beauty prize is awarded to Radjabov.
It is located in the north-east of the continent, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, in the heart of the Guyana plateau.
The country owes its name to its main river, the Suriname River.
It supplies sugar, coffee, chocolate and cotton to the metropolis through slave labor until the abolition of slavery in 1863.
Suriname became an autonomous region of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954 before gaining independence in 1975.
The head of the 1980 coup, Desi Bouterse, was elected President of the Republic in 2010.
Suriname is a democracy established by the 1987 Constitution.
The legislative body is the National Assembly, composed of 51 members elected every five years.
The National Assembly elects the President of the Republic, chief executive, by a two-thirds majority.
Suriname is a member of Caricom, the Caribbean common market.
Suriname has been a "special guest" member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) since 2012.
The naturalness of the environment decreases strongly around cities and along roads and tracks.
Illegal gold panning is in full development (now very visible on the latest satellite images of Google Earth for example).
The gigantic bauxite mines provide 80% of export earnings, but not without a major impact on the forest.
The Government of Suriname has established a multi-year development plan until 2010 to try to overcome poverty.
In the late 1880s, a watercolor by Arnold Borret represented 19 types.
Finally, many Brazilian migrant workers have recently arrived in Suriname.
Due to the large number of ethnic groups in the country, there is no main religion.
The main reason is that they want to avoid large fluctuations in the value of their currency.
Most Hindustanis are Hindu, but there are also Muslims and Christians among them.
The only Olympic medalist in Suriname is Anthony Nesty, winner of the 100 butterfly at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.
Angouleme is a commune in the south-west of France, prefecture of the department of Charente, in the region of New Aquitaine.
It is also a commercial and administrative city, with a university center, and a remarkably lively cultural life.
Many university or commercial research centers want to own one, as do many countries.
Geologically, the town belongs to the Aquitaine basin, as three quarters west of the department of Charente.
These alluviums deposited successively during the Quaternary in the interior of the two meanders of the river that are Basseau and Saint-Cybard.
The town of Angoul√™me is crossed by the river Charente, which makes two meanders.
The commune is mainly situated on the left bank, and three tributary streams on this bank also water the commune.
The Anguienne crosses the south of the city and flows into the Charente at Montauzier.
Further south, the parallel valley of Eau Eaux makes the limit of Angouleme, between Clairgon and Saint-Michel.
A small stream today channeled, the "Vimi√®re", is born at the Grand-Font and flows into the Charente at Houmeau.
All these communes except Dirac are part of Greater Angoul√™me, the agglomeration community.
The "old Angouleme" is the old part, between the rampart and the city center with winding streets and small squares.
Around, the old suburbs were five in number: Houmeau, Saint-Cybard, Saint-Martin, Saint-Ausone and La Bussatte.
The harbor of Houmeau was created in 1280 on the left bank of the river, at the foot of the plateau.
It marked the beginning of the navigable part, which went from Angoul√™me to the sea.
"Saint-Martin", "Saint-Ausone", is a district of two old parishes outside the ramparts.
"La Bussatte" whose Champ de Mars is an esplanade transformed today into a shopping center, adjoins "Saint-Gelais".
Angoul√™me is also connected to P√©rigueux by the D939, to Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly by the D939 and to Libourne by the D674.
The evolution of the "c" in "g" and the nasalisation of the initial consonant therefore appear only late, around the year one thousand.
An evolution identical to that which affected the name of the city would then have resulted in "Enguena".
Angouleme has contracted 4 loans, 3 of which are "toxic" with the Dexia bank.
These three toxic loans alone make up half of the municipality's debt.
Finally, Angoul√™me challenged the toxic loans in 2012 for "lack of advice" and "error in the calculation of interest rates".
However, the retroactive law on toxic borrowing of July 29, 2014 renders null and void any legal challenge to toxic borrowing.
The Champ de Mars, central square of the city, has been hosting since September 2007 an underground shopping arcade.
The East ring road was opened in 2004 (2010 for the last tranche), which opened up several neighborhoods.
The districts of Grande Garenne, Basseau and Ma Campagne are associated in a program of urban revitalization.
The city is twinned with eight other cities around the world:
These different data make Angouleme the largest urban agglomeration of Charente as well as the first urban area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe department.
The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the censuses of the population carried out in Angoul√™me since 1793.
Angoul√™me is the seat of the Angoul√™me Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Angoul√™me and the Angoumois country are classified City and Country of Art and History.
The ramparts of Angouleme form a balcony on the Charente, and they are classified historical monuments.
The "tower of the ramparts" is, with the cathedral, one of the main tourist attractions of the city.
Marquet Island and the wood of La Poudrerie, finally cleared, will be returned to the population.
Angoumoisine gastronomy is little different from Charentaise gastronomy in general.
The University Center of Charente is administratively attached to the University of Poitiers.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a place of worship rue du P√®re-Marquette
The barracks of Basseau and Ma Campagne have also left.
It takes 4 years for a tree to start producing.
The economy of many countries is dependent on coffee (coffee accounts for 50% of Ethiopia's exports, for example).
In Central America, lower prices encourage the cultivation of coca (cocaine production).
The prices collapsed, they are four times lower than in the 1960s.
10 years ago, 33% of the price of coffee went to producing countries, today is 10%
Nestl√© would make 26% margins on instant coffee.
Thus, Brazil, by improving its yields and increasing the quantities produced, would participate in the fall of prices.
At the moment, the weak organization of producers in terms of sales and improvement of farming practices is particularly evident.
Protectionist practices in rich countries discourage the development of competing crops.
In country-to-country comparisons, no country outperforms its competitors in all areas.
Developing countries blame the rich countries for the lack of progress.
Even in rich countries, in general the rich are not the first victims of natural disasters.
The light signal encoded by a variation of intensity is capable of transmitting a large amount of information.
Its properties are also exploited in the field of sensors (temperature, pressure, etc.), in imaging and in lighting.
At the time of the ancient Greeks, the phenomenon of the transport of light in glass cylinders was already known.
It was, it seems, used by glass artisans to create decorative pieces.
The use of glass in conjunction with light is therefore not recent.
The Irish John Tyndall repeated the experiment before the British Royal Society in 1854.
Their demonstration consisted in guiding the light in a jet of water poured from a hole at the base of a tank.
In this way they were able to demonstrate the principle underlying the optical fiber.
The first attempt at optical communication came from Alexander Graham Bell, one of the inventors of the phone.
Indeed, he developed, in the 1880s, the photophone.
The voice, amplified by a microphone, made vibrate a mirror that reflected the sunlight.
The receiver of this device was almost identical to that of the first phone.
In 1927, Baird and Hansell attempted to develop a fiber-based television picture device.
Hansell was able to patent his invention, but it was never really used.
However, it was still difficult at that time to conceive that these glass fibers could find an application.
This apparatus allowed the transmission of an image along glass fibers.
It was particularly used in endoscopy, to observe the inside of the human body, and to inspect welds in aircraft engines.
Unfortunately, the transmission could not be done over a long distance given the poor quality of the fibers used.
In 1957, the fiberscope (medical endoscope) was invented by Basil Hirschowitz in the United States.
Optical fiber telecommunications remained impossible until the invention of the laser in 1960.
The laser offered the possibility of transmitting a signal without loss over a large distance.
This experience is often considered as the first fiber optic data transmission.
This still made it uncomfortable compared to traditional copper wire.
The first optical telephone communication system was installed in downtown Chicago in 1977.
The first is the hacking of the computer system of a research center on climate change in England.
Optical fiber is a waveguide that exploits the refractive properties of light.
This ray then propagates to the other end of the optical fiber without loss, by taking a zigzag path.
In index gradient fiber, this index change is much more gradual.
Such fibers are called photonic crystal fibers, or micro-structured fibers.
These fibers usually have a much higher index contrast between the different materials (usually silica and air).
Under these conditions, the physical properties of the guide substantially differ from the index jump and index gradient fibers.
When attenuation is not the main selection criterion, it is also possible to use plastic fibers.
When an optical fiber is not yet powered, it is called black optical fiber.
Any information transmission system has a transmitter and a receiver.
The optical transponder has the function of converting electrical pulses into optical signals conveyed in the heart of the fiber.
For all types of optical detectors, the operating principle is the same: the photoelectric effect.
no-valid-translation
The attenuation and the deformation of the signal are direct consequences of the length of the transmission channel.
In order to preserve the optical signal of the source, the optical transmission systems use three types of amplifiers:
There are optical amplification repeaters (using rare earth doped glasses) or electronic repeaters-regenerators.
The first step is the production of a "preform": a very pure silica bar, several centimeters in diameter.
A substrate tube is placed in horizontal rotation in a glass lathe.
Gases are injected inside and will settle inside due to the heat generated by a blowtorch.
These gases will modify the properties of the glass (for example aluminum makes it possible to increase the index).
Then the tube is heated to high temperature, and will close on itself to form the preform.
This purification process is the only known cost-effective alternative to external deposition techniques.
In the second step, the preform is placed at the top of a fiber-drawing tower of about fifteen meters in height.
It is then transformed into a fiber of several hundreds of kilometers, at a speed of the order of a kilometer per minute.
In France, three factories are specialized in the production of optical fibers:
The main parameters that characterize the optical fibers used for transmissions are:
The formula_9 coefficient expressed in dB / km is often used and is related to formula_8 by formula_11.
The main advantage of optical fibers is extremely low attenuation.
Rayleigh scattering thus limits performance in the short-wave range (visible and near-ultraviolet range).
The most recent advances in manufacturing techniques can reduce this peak.
This near-infrared wavelength will therefore be preferred for optical communications.
It is therefore possible to minimize it by adapting the profile.
The current laboratory transmission rate record was established by NEC and Corning in September 2012.
A transmission channel is said to be non-linear when its transfer function depends on the input signal.
The Kerr effect, Raman scattering and the Brillouin effect are the main sources of nonlinearity in optical fibers.
Let us discuss the consequences of non-liner operations, where the automodulation of the phase can be changed, from four-wire to intra-inter-cannon channels.
The polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is expressed in ps / km¬Ω and characterizes the spread of the signal.
Multimode fibers (so-called MMF, for Multi Mode Fiber), were the first on the market.
Because of the modal dispersion, there is a temporal spread of the signal proportional to the length of the fiber.
As a result, they are used only for low flows or short distances.
However, the most recent fibers, of the OM3 type, make it possible to reach Gbit / s over distances of the order of one kilometer.
Long distances can only be covered by single-mode optical fibers.
Their very fine heart thus admits a mode of propagation, the most direct possible that is to say in the axis of the fiber.
Single-mode fibers are therefore suitable for intercontinental lines (submarine cables).
On the other hand, there is another type of dispersion: intramodal dispersion.
The cutoff wavelength is the formula_12 wavelength below which the fiber is no longer monomode.
A fiber is monomode for a standardized frequency V less than 2.405.
Charts provide the normalized propagation constant, denoted by B, as a function of the normalized frequency for the first modes.
The normalized frequency gives a direct indication of how many modes a fiber can hold.
As V increases, the number of modes supported by the fiber will increase.
The fibers can be connected to equipment through fiber optic connectors.
Optical fiber, thanks to the performances it offers, is more and more used in telecommunications networks.
With the rise of the Internet and digital exchanges, its use is spreading gradually to come to the individual.
Operators and companies were the first acquirers of fiber optics.
It is particularly appreciated by the army for its insensitivity to the EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) but also for its lightness.
An optical fiber is a waveguide in which a light wave is intensity modulated to transmit information.
A big disadvantage of these cables is that they are very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances of all kinds (lifts, strong currents, transmitters).
A major disadvantage of electric cables is the very fast attenuation of the signal they carry with the distance.
Reliable sites are thus connected from several hundred meters to several tens of kilometers apart.
However, it is possible to make a bidirectional link on a single optical fiber.
Several types of optical fibers are used today in computer networks:
Double-sheath fibers are increasingly used for high-power optical pumping.
As early as the 1970s, optical fiber was used in decorative color-changing luminaires.
The same applies to commercial premises in mixed use buildings.
This allows the light ray propagating in the optical fiber to be diffused on its surface.
By connecting the luminous fabric to LEDs of different colors, different colored lighting can be obtained.
Methods such as photochemotherapy use these laser powered textiles.
They can activate photosensitizers (porphyrin, chlorophyll, etc.) in the body of patients to destroy cancer cells.
It no longer has total internal reflection, light can escape from the optical fiber.
There are two phases in the deployment of technology in the territory.
As of March 31, 2011, 93% of the internet offers available for metropolitan France were for broadband.
The cost of deploying the optical fiber is also mentioned as a constraint.
This plan provides for a strong financial involvement of private operators as well as local authorities.
This willingness of the state to equip each home with optical fiber is not trivial.
Nevertheless, the current fleet does not allow everyone equal access to broadband.
Current deployments of optical fibers are presented on the France High Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãBroadband Observatory.
These three regions seem to be the most popular from an economic point of view.
But in most economic analyzes, the decision-maker's point of view is often poorly represented.
In addition, urban concentration allows easier network deployment.
Optical fiber is set to become the main tool for Internet access and digital access in France.
The will of the state is strong and the benefits of this technology on the current broadband are undeniable.
In addition, the country launched this investment policy a few years before France or Belgium.
The economic stakes are therefore important, but the technical, legal and social aspects are equally important.
Fiber is not yet sufficiently present to supplant copper.
At present, many services have no fiber equivalent: elevator alarms, remote reading systems, industrial modems, etc.
As Emperor, he calls himself "Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus".
They are paternal uncle Marcus Annius Libo fut consul; Even Faustine l'Ancienne is titled Augusta.
Sa m√®re Domitia Lucilla, was the daughter of Publius Calvisius Tullus Ruso, who had obtained her consulate in 109.
They are maternal bishops, Lucius Catilius Severus, who were consul et pr√©fet of Rome.
Her paternal grandmother was Rupilia Faustina, daughter of the consular Rupilius Bonus.
He had a sister younger than him, named Annia Cornificia.
After the death of his father in 124, he was raised and adopted by his paternal grandfather.
The historian Dion Cassius makes a particularly revealing judgment on the character of Marc Aur√®le.
The subjects being an honor to imitate their prince, one never saw so many philosophers as under his reign.
Il associ alors are fr√®re d'adoption Lucius Aurelius Verus √† l'Empire qui pour la premi√®re fois est dire par deux Augustes.
His reign was marked by the resurgence of wars on all fronts.
But the essentiel of the direction of operations is confident of some excellent genres, Statesus Priscus et surtout Avidius Cassius.
Lucius Verus installed his court in Antioch, which earned him accusations of debauchery and military incompetence.
The social and economic consequences of this epidemic, however, were very serious.
The economic and social consequences of a generation of tax cuts are obvious.
The social and economic consequences of the current provisions should be considered unacceptable.
As soon as the war against the Parthians is over, a new threat appears at the borders.
The barbarous bastards settled in the Danubeian regions, the Quades et les Marcomans, directing north of Italy.
The threat is so strong that the two emperors personally go on site in 168/169 and spend the winter in Aquileia.
In January 169 Lucius Aurelius Verus died exhausted and sick, leaving Marcus Aurelius as the only emperor.
It takes more than five years (169/175) to the emperor to overcome this threat.
It is based on the southern part of the generals, as well as the son-in-law, Claudius Pompeianus, or even Pertinax, the future empereur.
But in July 175 he was assassinated and his head sent to Marcus Aurelius.
On November 23, 176 in Rome are celebrated the triumphs over the Germanic peoples.
Ephemeral triumph because from 177 Marcus Aurelius must start fighting on the Danubian border.
It was during one of his campaigns on the Danube that Marcus Aurelius fell ill in Pannonia.
He died on March 17, 180, perhaps struck by the Antonine plague at "Vindobona" ‚Äã‚Äã(now Vienna in Austria).
The historian Dion Cassius writes that Marcus Aurelius was poisoned by his doctors on the orders of his ambitious son Commodus.
From this inheritance he made a practical philosophy of life which he exhibited in his only work "Pens√©es pour moi-m√™me".
Through the twelve books that make up the "Thoughts", several themes, often in the form of recurrent maxims.
Applying this philosophy, when he attended the circus games, ostensibly he did not look at the show and read.
It was said of Marcus Aurelius that he was "the philosophy (Stoic) sitting on a throne".
It is in this sense that the texts of Marc Aur√®le keep a certain interest.
By his "inner genius", his reasonable mind (it is not yet about rationality), man participates in this divine cosmos.
This vision eliminates the fear of death that is not annihilation but change, renewal of the universe.
Certainly, it can sometimes dominate us but it does not exist without its "actors" and men are part of it.
The man who follows reason in everything is "calm and decided at the same time, radiant and at the same time consistent".
Marc-Aur√®le is a thinker of the bond, of a relativity of bonds inscribing itself in the absolute of a unification giving meaning to our actions.
The emperor is already in favor of a thought for the complementarity of scientific disciplines.
The Emperor, anxious and anxious about public health matters, does his best to prevent the terrible progress of the plague.
Many economists unfamiliar with public health issues have turned into resolute opponents.
Anxious for his safety, he reinforced the Praetorian Guard (the guard of the Emperor).
Both legs were also exhumed by the team led by Belgian professor Marc Waelkens of the Catholic University of Louvain.
The demography of France is all the data and studies concerning the population of France at all times.
These data are calculated by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).
The total fertility rate is 1.96 in 2015, compared with 2.9 in 1950 and 1.8 in 1990.
Although higher than the European average, the fertility rate is slightly insufficient to ensure the renewal of generations.
It is also slightly insufficient to ensure the renewal of generations.
The following table presents the ten European countries with the highest birth rate in 2015.
The number of births in France is continuously higher than that of Germany since 2000.
These figures have been stable overall since the end of the 1980s.
17.2% of sexually active women had used abortion during their lifetime in 2007.
The increase in women's participation in the labor force would be greater.
Parents born in France include parents born in overseas communities (COM). "
In France, infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death, behind cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
According to the definition of the High Council for Integration (HCI) of 1991, is immigrated "any person born abroad abroad".
G√©rard Noiriel estimated in 2002 this proportion to about a third if we go back to great-grandparents.
40% of them had French nationality, which they could acquire by naturalization or by marriage.
They came from Europe (46%), Africa (30%), Asia (14%) and finally America and Oceania (10%).
A joint study by INSEE and INED, specifies the family background of populations who have a history with migration.
We can also see that only 16% of this population has no French ancestry.
The following table shows the breakdown by origin of immigrants and their children in 2008 according to INSEE.
The following table shows the age distribution of immigrants and their children in 2008 according to INSEE.
The number of French nationals residing outside France is poorly known.
Many of them are registered with a consulate, but many are not.
France-metropolis and overseas departments and regions (DROM) - is populated by 66.6 million inhabitants in 2016.
Spaces with very low density have less than 20 inhabitants per km¬≤.
Moreover, in each of these spaces, the French live mostly in the cities.
Indeed, we observe that migration between regions is intensifying.
The old industrial regions of the North and East also have negative net migration.
Coastalization is the concentration of activities and populations on the coast.
Metropolisation and littoralisation are thus today main characteristics of the distribution of the French population.
With 12.4 million inhabitants, the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãParis largely dominates the other urban areas.
Next are the areas of Lyon, Marseilles, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice, whose population is over a million inhabitants.
The majority of urban dwellers now live in suburban suburbs or suburbs.
It was therefore necessary to develop a transportation network to meet the needs of the population.
Public transport is less polluting and allows for more sustainable development.
Campaigns close to cities have become residential and recreational spaces for urban people.
Note: in the previous table, we obtain a total of 100% by adding the first four columns of percentages.
The latter includes individuals aged 75 and over, who are already counted in the age group 65 and over.
"*: Number of immigrants according to the INSEE definition (foreign born abroad)
It is therefore different from tables related to immigration that only include immigrants (born abroad). "
"Reading: 11.6% of people residing in metropolitan France in 2012 were born abroad.
Of these 2.7% were born French and 8.8% were born with another nationality.
8.4% of people residing in metropolitan France in 2012 were born outside Europe or in a Dom.
Of these, 2.9% were born French and 5.5% were born with another nationality. "
Evolution of the number of marriages and pacs concluded until 2015:
According to the two most recent studies conducted by the Ifop institutes in 2011 and CSA in 2012:
The census of the population in France makes it possible to establish the number of legal inhabitants of each French commune.
This number is indispensable for the application of 351 legislative articles of 28 different codes.
This number is also necessary for the management of municipalities for:
The population of France (DROM included) would reach 76.45 million inhabitants in 2070, according to the "central scenario".
According to the highest assumptions the population would reach 87.64 million in 2070.
There are no recent projections for the DROM population in 2070.
Population projections of INSEE, central scenario for France (DROM included).
The feminist movement has produced a great diversity of sociological and philosophical analyzes.
In this perspective, the notion of "gender" intends to "denaturalize" the relations between the sexes.
The term "feminism" has long been wrongly attributed to Fourier.
He marries the great political upheavals of the century, during which his claims re-emerge.
Mary Wollstonecraft will be quickly forgotten in France, before being rediscovered by Flora Tristan in 1840.
Extinct under the Empire and the Restoration, feminist claims are reborn in France with the Revolution of 1830.
Feminists participate in the abundant literature of the time, favored by the lifting of censorship on the press.
Some women claim the right to free love, to the scandal of public opinion.
However, it is not followed by all Saint-Simonians who stand out from the accusations of immoralism that strike the movement.
As in 1789, women actively participate in the revolutionary days of February 1848.
In particular, there is concern about the threat that the liberated speech of women could have on the family.
The Women's Club will eventually be closed so as not to disturb public order.
Louise Aston or Louise Dittmar are trying to launch the first newspapers dedicated to the cause of women.
The return to order will slow down for fifteen years this first momentum.
If the first collective manifestation of American feminism coincides chronologically with the Spring of the European peoples, its intellectual origins differ significantly.
Dissenting Protestant sects, especially the Quakers, are the main vehicle of ideas for the emancipation of women.
Educated and independent, women who improvise as teachers have historically provided a significant share of feminist activists.
However, they suffer from a lack of training, resulting from their exclusion from the university.
New graduates are at the forefront of the women's education movement.
The next step is to open access to matriculation examinations.
The Second Empire is the scene of several advances in the field of women's education.
The loi Duruy of 1867 aligns the southern standards with the male standards fixing it at 500.
Mobilization for women's education is supported in the liberal opposition to the regime, especially in Saint-Simonian circles.
Elisa Lemonnier created in 1862 the first professional schools for young girls.
The girls' colleges, whose programs remain specific, are instituted by the S√©e law (1880).
The Third Republic is characterized in France by the constitution of reformist feminist organizations, more durable and structured.
In 1891, the French Federation of Feminist Societies symbolized the entry of the term "feminism" into the militant vocabulary.
The French Union for the Suffrage of Women federates in 1909 feminists who favor the right to vote for women.
The standoff with the authorities lasted until the beginning of the First World War.
In the United States, the common front between feminists and anti-slavery gradually eroded after the American Civil War.
Two rival organizations were born in 1869 from disagreements within the American Equal Rights Association.
His claims, which go beyond the scope of political rights, are inspired by the text developed at the Senecca Falls Convention.
In 1890, the two associations ended up regrouping in the "National American Woman Suffrage Association".
In the meantime, in 1869 and 1870, the territories of Wyoming and Utah authorized the vote of white women.
Feminists are active in other countries, particularly in Northern Europe, for example Emilie Mundt and Marie Luplau in Denmark.
This is true for any country, but especially for rich countries.
He intends more largely to restore purity of morals and public morality, and to defend the family.
Faced with this movement, activists who favor free love and birth control are isolated.
Some of them adhere to the neo-Malthusian movement, very active in Britain but also in France.
At the end of the century, the writings of Edward Carpenter or Havelock Ellis, however, contribute to spreading these ideas more widely.
In 1906, the Berne Convention, ratified by fourteen countries, banned night industrial work for women.
Already in force in some countries, such as France, where it has been applied since 1892, this legislation meets the opposition of egalitarian feminists.
After the war, the International Labor Office adopted the slogan of protection of women workers.
The first international women's event was held on March 8, 1911, following a proposal by Clara Zetkin.
During the First World War, the vast majority of women's organizations in the belligerent countries supported the war effort.
The International Congress for Future Peace is being organized by Addams and physicist Aletta Jacobs in The Hague.
Socialist circles, and their women's organizations, have also lined up behind their respective nations.
It adjusts to the imperatives of the natalist policies that are further strengthened after the demographic bleeding of the First World War.
Nazi officials did not support this v√∂lkisch feminism, which ceased to exist in 1937.
As a result of this publication, she becomes an emblematic figure of feminism.
From the 1960s, in the United States, equality of rights is progressing.
In 1963, the Equal Pay Act was passed.
On July 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act ("Civil Rights Act") theoretically abolished all forms of discrimination in the United States.
They also develop forms of original organizations, such as consciousness-raising groups.
The period is marked by an intense activity of theorizing the status of women.
They reject the reformist goal of equality "in" the system that has prevailed until then.
They advocate reversing this system and creating a new relationship between the sexes.
A separatist trend is also emerging, particularly among lesbian activist groups in major cities such as London or New York.
The control of their bodies is at the center of feminist preoccupations of the second wave.
A long-time division, birth control becomes one of its most visible demands.
Free access to contraception but especially the right to abortion focus their efforts.
In France, the Movement for the Freedom of Abortion and Contraception (MLAC) was founded in 1973.
Sexuality is thus analyzed as an area where male domination is exercised.
With the development of the use of the concept of gender are developing subsequently departments of gender studies.
In 2003, there were 600 such departments in the United States.
According to this sociologist, little research has managed to penetrate the "scientific mainstream".
Since the late 1990s, various groups, whether feminist or not, have been created.
This change in landscape inevitably leads to divergent views that divide feminist currents.
As such, it sets as horizon indifference to sex differences in the context of public space.
All these rights must be able to guarantee the autonomy of women as subjects.
Stigmatizing the egalitarian claims of some feminists, he claims to respect the biological specificity of women.
At the strategic level, women's mobilizations must remain subordinated to class struggle.
Only the overthrow of capitalism can put an end to the oppression of women.
This movement, contemporary with the emergence of French radical feminism, had a profound impact at the time:
This book highlights moral development trajectories that differ from the more masculine ones of Lawrence Kohlberg.
The ethics of solicitude is a contemporary development of the feminism of difference.
A more theoretical approach can also be found in the works of Paul B. Preciado.
The figurehead is Virginia Bolten, a revolutionary feminist and libertarian communist.
In Spain, from 1922, "Estudios" is at the forefront of a campaign for sex education and female emancipation.
Open to debates on sexuality, this eclectic and libertarian journal addresses nudism, free love and sex education.
It has a decisive influence on the Spanish working class by helping to radically change mentalities.
In the United States, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre, Lucy Parsons and Kate Austin are the main theoreticians.
Like most feminist currents, Afro-feminism criticizes the standards of beauty imposed by society.
Afro-feminists also criticize the lack of representation of black women in the media.
Black activists therefore demand a more positive and realistic portrayal of blacks in television fiction.
Afro-feminists criticize this virtual absence of black women and argue in favor of a greater presence of these in the public space.
See also the list of feminists and list of Muslim feminists.
The American feminist bell hooks claims that men also suffer from a stifling and dehumanizing patriarchal system.
Men's specific advocacy movements were created in response to feminism: masculinism and hominism.
The Gibraltar question is a major cause of dissension in Hispanic-British relations.
Gibraltar is part of the European Union (under which it enjoys a special status) but not the Schengen area.
The airport of Gibraltar has code LXGB, according to the list of prefixes of the ICAO codes of the airports.
Its track has the particularity of being crossed by the road connecting Gibraltar to Spain.
The territory of Gibraltar has several sites occupied by Neanderthals.
The site of Gorham Cave has also delivered Mousterian industries that could be among the most recent.
In Greek antiquity, the rock is also associated with Briaree, one of the Hecatonchires.
Before the Muslim conquest, the Rock of Gibraltar was called Mount Calpe.
In 1374 the M√©rinides yield the rock to the kingdom of Granada.
This period is known as the "big seat" and lasted 3 years.
In 1805, an epidemic of yellow fever killed a third of the Gibraltarians.
The Mediterranean climate favors a resistant vegetation of scrubland, maquis and pine forest.
Gibraltar has no natural resources exploited; however, a desalination plant was recently created inside the Rock.
Gibraltar is the only place in Europe where grows in nature; this plant is normally native to North Africa.
It is the symbol of the Rock of Gibraltar Nature Reserve.
Olive and pine are among the species that grow most commonly on the Rock.
Nevertheless, the specialists insist on the wild character of these monkeys.
Other mammal species on the island include rabbits, foxes and bats.
In addition, dolphins and whales are regularly present in the Bay of Gibraltar.
Migratory birds are very common; Gibraltar is home to the only partridge gambra present on the European continent.
This richness of nature is threatened by urban development, tourism and invasive plant species.
But also by the species of birds and bats likely to jeopardize the natural balance of the peninsula
The United Kingdom has retained responsibility for defense, foreign policy, internal security and economic issues.
The role of the governor is mainly symbolic: he does not participate in the administration of the territory.
He is responsible for defense and security inside Gibraltar (the "Royal Gibraltar Police").
The Gibraltar Parliament is composed of 17 members elected for a four-year term.
The most important problem is the permanent request of Spain for the transfer of this territory.
The political parties and a large majority of the inhabitants are opposed to it.
In fact, the vast majority of the world's major economies are those of allied countries in the United States.
Gibraltar is still on the official list of territories to be decolonized according to the UN.
Gibraltar has been part of the European Union since 1973, in accordance with the UK's Accession Treaty, but enjoys a special status there.
Gibraltar is not subject to the obligation to levy VAT, nor is it a member of the Customs Union.
Gibraltar's economy is based on the services sector, mainly those related to finance and tourism.
But this sector is still composed mainly of traditional services such as restaurants, taxis and hairdressers.
This earned the British enclave until 2009 to appear on the OECD's gray list of tax havens.
In 2013, 18,000 companies were officially registered in Gibraltar (in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãjust 30,000 inhabitants).
Recently, many bookmakers and online gambling operators have also moved to Gibraltar.
In terms of tourism, Gibraltar is a favorite stopover for cruise ships.
In addition, the majority of shops and restaurants also accept euros, but with an unfavorable exchange rate.
It should be noted, however, that the pound of Gibraltar does not prevail in Great Britain.
The origins of the inhabitants of Gibraltar are Spanish, British and Mediterranean (mainly Genoese and Maltese).
The main religion is Christianity, Catholic in majority and Anglican.
There is also a large Jewish community, a Moroccan Muslim population and a number of people from the Indian subcontinent.
The official language is English, used in government and business.
Many people also use llanito, a mix of Spanish and English.
It is for many people a festive occasion, everyone dresses in red and white, national colors.
The political rally culminates with the release of thirty thousand red and white balloons representing the people of Gibraltar.
The most important clubs in the territory are Lincoln FC, Manchester United, Glacis United and Europa College.
Most matches are played at the Victoria Stadium, with a capacity of five thousand places.
The British Forces Gibraltar are in charge of the defense of this strategic site.
The squadron is responsible for the security and integrity of the British territorial waters of Gibraltar (BGTW).
It is an important base for NATO, with British and US nuclear submarines refueling frequently.
The ships of the Spanish Navy do not refuel there however.
The Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Gibraltar is part of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment.
The popular use of the term astrology generally refers to Western astrology, to which this article is devoted.
His popular versions are the horoscopes of magazines or the affinities of zodiac signs.
Faced with these considerations, the defenders of astrology tend to reduce its deterministic character.
There are many different astrological practices, but some constants emerge:
Astrology is the study of supposed relations between earthly affairs and celestial phenomena in general.
More precisely, it relies on 4 main cycles and their analog applications:
From these cycles, various techniques have been developed, the main ones using:
Added to this are the meanings of the various interactions of these elements:
There is often a claim that the ancients did not distinguish astrology from astronomy.
Ancient Greek astronomers, even if they did not explicitly say so, clearly made the difference.
Ptolemy deals with astronomy and astrology in two separate works, respectively "Almagest" and "Tetrabiblos".
It was therefore necessary to be an astronomer before pretending to be an astrologer.
For the contemporary observer as for his Paleolithic ancestor, the night sky is a cause for wonder.
On an astronomical level, we actually "come" from this big ensemble-it's our galaxy.
The asterisms are recognizable by the modern astronomer as well as the Paleolithic observer because they present regularities, which we call gestalts.
It is these processions, perceived as irregular, and these occasional conjunctions which are the empirical bases of the astrological theories.
The different levels of interpretation (physical conjectures and human conjectures) coexist for a certain time, then progressively dissociate.
Its support being the stars, astrology is one of the divinatory practices particularly prevalent in the history of cultures.
Their displacement made it possible to predict the seasons, or the illumination of the night by the moon.
This eventually gave the lunar, solar, and luni-solar calendars.
The movement of the stars being perceived as divine will, the priests or astrologers served as translators.
Their knowledge was that of initiates, the teachings of the temples being kept secret.
The "astral fatalism" developed late, after the conquest of Babylonia by Persian King Cyrus in 539 BC.
Belief in the predetermination of character and destiny opened the way for individual astrology.
The oldest known "horoscopes" come from Babylon and date from 410 BC.
Parallel to this astrology, different systems are formed in China, in pre-Columbian America and probably in other civilizations.
But Chinese astrology and Chaldean astrology are the only systems that have survived to this day.
All currently known systems of astrology derive from one of these two systems (or both, the case of Tibetan astrology).
They had built a "science of celestial lights" and offered remedies for everyday worries.
From Chaldea, astronomy-astrology spreads in Greece after the conquests of Alexander the Great.
Plato holds the stars for "divine and eternal living", "visible gods" ("Timaeus", 39th-40d).
Others had preceded him in this step, but it is the authority of Ptolemy who really made school.
In the year 529, the Emperor Justinian closed the schools of philosophy of Athens.
The scholars of the time, the masters of neo-Platonism, took refuge in Gundishapur among the Sassanids in Persia.
Astronomy, medicine, philosophy, etc. were intensely developed in this academy of Gundishapur where confluent scholars of all sides.
The Muslim conquests seized Gundishapur, which had a great reputation.
This Gundishapur school had a great influence on the development of the Arab-Muslim civilization.
He was Sabean, from Harran, where he collected the Mesopotamian astrological knowledge that enriched the Arab-Muslim knowledge.
In particular, he taught that each planet possessed a daemon, that is to say, a spirit or an intelligence that guided it.
The Jew Mashallah, for example, lived at the court of Al Mansur.
Following the occupation of Spain by the Moors, astrology came back in force in European civilization in the Middle Ages.
She met Nostradamus and had several personal astrologers, including Como Ruggieri.
The second, that of the popular astrologers, would like to preserve it, with all its superstitions.
In England, it will be erased from academic disciplines only a century later.
Isaac Newton still studies it in university, "to see what is true".
In France, astrology was long confined to esoteric-clandestine circles (spiritualists, Kabbalists, Theosophists ...).
Astrology reappears in the scientific field through the door of the psychology of the depths.
Astrology also finds a considerable place in the "New Age" movement.
There are many schools: psychological astrology, conditionalist astrology, karmic astrology, humanistic astrology, "etc."
The symbolism of the stars and their movements is very flexible, which can change according to the context and the school of the astrologer.
Each object has its own symbolism and sometimes special techniques.
Engineers, psychologists and statisticians approach this discipline using a statistical approach.
These practices are today all subject to criticism and controversy.
Astrology has long been a subject of controversy and criticism of the philosophical, theological, scientific or even epistemological type.
Essentially developed around Western astrology, the elements of the debates gradually spread to all astrological practices.
Nevertheless, defenders of astrology claim that their personal experience shows undeniable effects.
- lack of effect: astrological predictions are no better than chance;
- the absence of cause: there is no mechanism justifying any astral influence.
The systematic search for effects has led to work in the field of "statistical astrology".
For example, Pluto is associated with the sign of Scorpion only very recently since it was only discovered in 1930.
The motivation of the fight against obscurantism is not in itself an argument against astrology.
The confusion between ideological and argumentative dimensions generates an often sterile debate, difficult to analyze.
These simultaneously present critical facts, especially when they describe astrology as a "superstition based on the credulity of people".
The epistemological impossibility of demonstrating the non-existence of a thing partially illustrates the intrinsic difficulty of the debate.
The argument of the epistemological difficulty of the dialogue appears in fact fallacious.
Some studies conducted by astrologers retain experimental devices that tend to produce consistently positive results.
For Robert Hand, the formulation of non-mechanistic hypotheses is essential to scientifically understand astrology.
All of these polemics present a "case study" of undeniable interest for the sociology of science and epistemology.
Representatives of skeptics (Anglo-Saxon or French skeptics) explain the interest in horoscopes by the Barnum effect and its corollaries.
These analyzes lead them to consider publicly astrology as a "superstition based on the credulity of people".
If astrology and astronomy share their historical roots, the two practices are now detached and distinct.
Some invoke an "acausal" phenomenon (without a causal link), Jungian synchronicity.
For the latter, the planets alone have an influence, the constellations serving as a reference (like the numbers on a clock).
The twelve divisions of the tropical zodiac are based on this basic data.
Fixed signs are more difficult to circumscribe, according to astrologers.
To date, no direct effect of the planets on the human body has been rigorously observed.
The signs of the Zodiac, which serve as frame of reference and analysis, correspond by analogy to constellations located on the ecliptic.
(Previously, these limits varied from one astronomical atlas to another, and even from one tradition to another).
According to Dane Rudhyar, for example (in his book "The Practice of Astrology"):
But, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that the astrological division in 12 has its raison d'√™tre.
than with 13 phases (or 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, etc.).
Simply because we can cut out any set of elements having an even number of elements (and greater than 4),
(This does not detract from the mythological meaning attached to this symbol).
The problem is that by removing the relationship between constellations and signs, we deny the causality between the two.
Supporters of sidereal astrology find an argument for their cause.
Unlike practitioners in other esoteric disciplines, some astrologers announce that they can predict, among other things, very specific and easily verifiable events.
In this sense, test protocols to put them to the test are easy to set up.
The predictions of astrologers are then validated if they are of better quality than the random forecasts.
Result: Computer eight successes, Elisabeth Tessier and Skeptical Seven Achievements.
The zetetic circle of the University of Nice has created the International Zetetic Challenge.
After a few years of operation, very few astrologers competed, the test was stopped for lack of fighters.
Statistical astrology is also a very marginal activity, the basic methodological principles of which are not necessarily (re-) known to astrologers.
In addition, some predictive successes can be explained by the objective probability of the occurrence of an event.
Its longevity has reversed year after year these predictions, presented as solid.
It should be noted that in the year of his death, these same astrologers could count this prediction as a "success".
Assuming the same precision of the predictions, this comparison would be interesting.
Therefore, it is impossible to study current astrological methods according to the scientific criteria of reproducibility.
This demonstration, very easily reproducible, is available in the book "Become a wizard, become a scholar".
"The authors do not propose to examine the work of metapsychics, which would have been a constructive undertaking.
By treating the subject lightly, they convey the message that it is inconsistent.
Such a way of doing things is more ideology than science.
In parallel to traditional or traditionalist astrology, there are other currents of thought.
That of astro-psychologists, who develop an astrology based on the theories of Psychology and Psychoanalysis.
This current rejects the scientific approach applied to astrology, and rejects the merits.
At least as long as human beings continue to live only on Earth.
For some astrologers, this shift would make sense (except for the siderealist school, which relies only on constellations), and would even be fundamental.
Thus, we now speak with greater respect of the "first peoples" perpetuating a shamanic tradition.
At a time when psychoanalysis is opening up to shamanism, astrology will regenerate its sources, beyond the Mediterranean basin.
Gold 60 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.
These legislations are renewed a century later by Hadrian, himself an amateur astrologer.
This article was deleted by the reform of the penal code, under the presidency of Fran√ßois Mitterrand.
Fortunately, this article of the Turkish Penal Code will be revised and may be repealed.
For the general public, the distinction between astrologer and clairvoyant is often blurred.
The Federation of Francophone Astrologers (FDAF) asks its members to sign a code of ethics that prohibits formal predictions.
In neuroscience, homeostasis plays a key role in a speculative theory of consciousness and the sense of unity of the Self.
The National Assembly plays a key role in improving the functioning of the state.
It therefore refers to the set of corrective and regulatory feedbacks by which degradation triggers production and reorganization. "
In other words, the further away a galaxy is from us, the faster it seems to move away.
This law only concerns the part of the universe accessible to observations.
To this one are superimposed the own motions acquired by the galaxies because of their gravitational interactions with their neighbors.
In the same way, the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are gradually getting closer to the supercluster of the Virgin.
Hubble's law takes its name from the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who published it in 1929.
The observation of the period of variation of Cepheids in another galaxy thus made it possible to deduce their relative distance.
For this reason, the authorship of Hubble's law is attributed to Edwin Hubble, hence his name.
where formula_2 is Hubble's constant, the letter "H" being of course used in honor of Hubble.
The index 0 is used to indicate the value of the constant at the moment.
These two laws are valid only for low speed values, so for relatively small distances.
This result is consistently obtained by many methods:
Thus, there is no ambiguity in the definition of quantities "v", formula_2, and "d".
At a great distance, it is necessary to specify what is meant by distance and recession speed.
Moreover, nothing guarantees "a priori" that the linear relation mentioned above remains valid.
There are actually corrections to Hubble's law.
These play a crucial role in cosmology because they allow in principle to reconstruct directly the recent history of expansion.
They play a crucial role in reducing the carbon emissions that cause global warming.
where the quantity formula_6 is the deceleration parameter of the expansion, proportional to the second derivative of the scale factor.
In this case, the distances are generally expressed as a function of the "redshift" and not the opposite, and the formulas are written:
See Angular Distance and Brightness Distance sections for more details.
The doctrine of Sikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of the Ten gurus, collected in Sri Guru Granth Sahib.
His parents are Punjabi and belong to a trading caste: the Khatri of Punjab.
From his childhood, Guru Nanak is fascinated by spirituality and shows unusual dispositions for learning.
Mardana decides to follow Guru Nanak who makes his pilgrimage to Mecca.
This trip will take them to the Arabian Peninsula, Persia and Afghanistan.
After several years of traveling, Guru Nanak brings together a community and founds a village, Kartarpur- the City of the Creator.
He teaches tirelessly and many people come to his teaching.
He particularly regrets the antagonism between Hindus and Muslims, when he sees the common wealth of these two religions.
A well-known phrase of Guru Nanak is: "There is no Hindu and no Muslim.
His followers refer to him as guru (teacher, master).
Before his death, he indicates a new guru to be his successor and to lead the community.
The holy book of the Sikhs is compiled and edited by the fifth guru, Gur√ª Arjun in 1604.
They are mainly written in Punjabi, but also in Hindi, Persian, etc.
Guru Arjan also built the world-famous GurdwƒÅrƒÅ-Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, which is the center of Sikhism.
(And the Maharaja Ranjit singh puts gold on this Gurdwara).
They had to make extreme sacrifices to protect and preserve their faith and identity.
The Mughal Empire was in disintegration, the Afghans, under the leadership of Ahmed Shah Abdali, had begun to invade the country.
The Sikhs took advantage of these circumstances to establish their own kingdom, which they completed under Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).
The Sikh Empire lasted half a century and was annexed by the English in 1849.
Their taste for adventure and business has taken them to almost every country in the world.
He is called: the Supreme Guru (or in common language, "What God!
Not only all Sikh philosophy, but also the whole history and temperament of the Sikhs flow from this view.
The doctrinal position of Guru Nanak is quite simple, despite its origin.
Guru Nanak calls it "The True Name" (Satnam) to avoid using a term that is more restrictive.
For God is neither Muslim, nor Hindu, nor of this or that confession: God is ONE- "Ek Omkar".
Indeed, in the "Guru Granth Sahib" it is written:
Sikhism considers that all religions can lead to God.
Guru Nanak also subscribes to the belief in the maya, the illusion of the physical world.
Before long, the digital world and the physical world will be indistinguishable.
A Sikh can not have faith in any other living or non-living prophet.
In accordance with Sikhism, God never appears in human form.
Sikhism is based on the theory of karma and reincarnation.
The pilgrimage to "holy" places does not fit in Sikhism.
A Sikh submits to the will of God but is always willing to fight for a better tomorrow.
Similarly, Sikhs do not believe in worshiping idols, rituals, or superstitions.
This religion corresponds to a way of being, of rendering service to humanity and of engendering tolerance and fraternity for all.
The Gurus of Sikhism do not ask for the withdrawal of the world to attain salvation.
Wealth and personal possessions are not obstacles to achieving spiritual ideals:
Sikhism advocates authentic lucidity and courage (beyond the cleavage pessimism / optimism):
Sikhs must marry the person of their choice.
The physical, sexual union is only the culmination of the prior spiritual union.
Without this prior spiritual union, there can be no marriage and, therefore, no physical union is possible or desirable.
The Sikh temple is called "Gurdw√¢r√¢" (literally, "Guru's Gate").
To enter, you must take off your shoes and cover your head.
The main hall of the temple contains the throne, the Guru Granth Sahib under a canopy.
Sikhs prostrate themselves before the sacred book and deposit a gift of money, before sitting on the ground to pray.
It is a duty for a Sikh to participate in community service.
Sikhs are settled mainly in Punjab, for 80% of them, but also in the Delhi region.
In India, the Sikh community is estimated at some 20 million people, about 2% of the Indian population.
For example, most of the Kundalini Yoga mantras are taken from Siri Guru Granth Sahib.
They are often mistreated and confused with Muslims.
The balance sheet reports 7 dead and 3 seriously injured.
Sikhs may also be considered Muslim because of their physical appearance.
In the United Kingdom, however, Sikhs are exempted from wearing a helmet on motorized two-wheelers if they wear a turban.
The Sikhs indeed wear a turban by tradition but also for convenience.
Indeed, Sikhs do not cut their hair or beard, the turban allows them to wrap their hair.
The Representative Council of Sikhs of France is the representative body of Sikh religious and social organizations.
Marginal and nomadic Sikhs Nihan Singh eat meat while other Sikhs are vegetarians.
During ceremonial ceremonies, goats are beheaded with a sword and their flesh is consumed by the assistants.
This is a way of showing that they are different from other Sikhs.
However, not all "Singh" are Sikhs, this name being also widely used by Hindus.
Vijay Singh, Indian writer and filmmaker and the Fijian golfer of the same name are not Sikhs.
Its perimeter has a fairly round shape to the north and west, the southeast being marked by a relatively straight angle.
To the south, the municipal territory follows the foot of a marked topographic slope.
North of the S√©e, the interfluve is massive and is organized in a succession of topographic domes of elongated forms.
A relatively narrow glacis develops between the major bed of the river and the foot of a steep topographic slope.
The latter corresponds to the contact between granite and metamorphic schists.
La Se draws many meanders in its major bed corresponding to its field of flood.
The toponym would come from a Gaulish anthroponym "(Briccius)" or novel "(Briccios)".
At the time when S√©e was navigable, the port allowed the boats to refuel in agricultural products.
The fording on the S√©e would have been replaced later by a stone bridge.
The old town was to predate the Norman invasions, and had a church dedicated to St. Martin.
This church would have been overthrown by the invaders and rebuilt after their conversion.
It is admitted that the first castle of Br√©cey was established in the village of La Tourelle near.
The first Lord of Br√©cey known followed William the Conqueror in England.
It was around this church that the new agglomeration developed while the old town was to disappear.
The Romanesque church of Br√©cey was dedicated to the Abbey of Savigny, it was restored in 1435.
In 1613, Jean de Vassy, ‚Äã‚Äãlord of Br√©cey, obtained erection in barony of his land of Br√©cey.
Jacques de Vassy erected the castle of Br√©cey on the left bank of the S√©e, near the village of Logis.
The castle, now mutilated, was more important and its avenues joined the stone bridge.
The fairs go back to 1401 (Fair Sainte-Croix on September 14 and Saint-Michel on October 16).
The neighboring town of Cuves, the oldest and rival (chief legal place) finally bow to Br√©cey.
The treatment of Br√©cey was important, she maintained a priest and four vicars but also a teacher and a school teacher.
In 1800, Br√©cey took his final figure of big borough, chief town of canton and justice of Peace.
Its markets and fairs will increase its prosperity; from that time several public buildings are built.
But this prosperity is only partially solid ... it is precarious prosperity. "
In 1807, the mayor divided the commune into four sections, taken up again by the 1825 land register.
Between 1850 and 1870, a new town hall, a boys' school and a new hall on the grain menu were built.
Two free schools for girls and boys are created by clergy and parishioners.
The municipal council is composed of nineteen members including the mayor and three deputies.
The Br√©cey Sports Association has a football team in the league of Basse-Normandie and three others in district divisions.
Galaxies are of three main morphological types: elliptical, spiral, irregular.
There are certain stars with a high speed compared to their galaxy, sign that they are no longer gravitationally related.
Such stars are thus called "fleeing stars".
However, this nomenclature fell into disuse for the benefit of the term "galaxy".
Remarkably, these numbers can be expressed only in terms of various fundamental constants.
It takes more than ten billion years for the light from the most distant galaxies to reach Earth.
From antiquity, philosophers tried to capture the nature of the light band known as the Milky Way.
conceived it as "the effect of the light of the stars which are not offended by the Sun".
), suggested that it was due to a large number of small stars.
J.-C., describes the Milky Way as "one of the great circles of the sphere of fixed.
There are 7 great circles: the equator, the zodiac, the colures, the horizon in each place, the meridian, the Milky Way. "" "
He also proposed that the Milky Way was a collection of innumerable nebulous stars.
Kant also suggested that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky could be galaxies.
He made a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way and placed the Solar System near the center.
In 1845, Lord Rosse built a new telescope that was able to distinguish elliptical and spiral nebulae.
Looking in the photograph, he found 11 more novas.
Curtis noticed that these novas were on average 10 magnitudes lower than that of our galaxy.
The fact was definitively established by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using a new telescope.
This led to the postulation of the existence of a new form of matter, called dark matter.
This one emits no radiation, but its existence is revealed by the influence of its gravitational field on the dynamics of the stars.
Since the early 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope has made a great improvement in distant observations.
There are three major types of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular.
A detailed description of the different types of galaxies based on their appearance is established by the Hubble sequence.
These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the angle of view.
Their appearance shows few structures and they do not have a lot of interstellar matter.
As a result, these galaxies contain few open clusters and have a low star formation rate.
In this sense, they have a certain similarity with globular clusters, but on a larger scale.
Many elliptical galaxies are thought to have formed through an interaction of galaxies that eventually fused.
They can reach huge sizes (compared to spiral galaxies, for example).
On the other hand, these giant elliptical galaxies are often found in the heart of large clusters of galaxies.
Starburst galaxies are often the result of a collision of galaxies.
Spiral galaxies form the most emblematic class of galaxies.
A galaxy "Sa" has relatively poorly defined arms and has a relatively large central region.
On the other hand, a galaxy "Sc" has arms very open and well traced as well as a bulb of small size.
The spiral arms rotate around the center, just like the stars, but with constant angular velocity.
This effect is similar to a "wave" of slowdown on a highway saturated with cars.
The majority of spiral galaxies have a linear band of stars at their center, from which the spiral arms emerge.
Many barred spiral galaxies are active, this may be channeled gas along the arms.
An annular galaxy can form when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a spiral galaxy.
Such an event could have occurred on the Andromeda galaxy, which has several rings in infrared.
A lenticular galaxy is a form of transition, having both the properties of an elliptical and spiral galaxy.
They have arms, although poorly defined, and a halo of elliptical stars (the barred lenticular galaxies are of type "SB0").
In addition to the morphologies mentioned above, there are a number of galaxies that do not fit into any of these categories.
An "Irr-I" galaxy has some structure, but is not clearly related to any type of Hubble sequence.
Examples close to irregular galaxies (dwarfs) are the Magellan clouds.
Dwarf galaxies may themselves also be classified as elliptical, spiral, or irregular.
Near the galactic center, the velocity is proportional to the distance to the galactic center.
The angular speed of rotation is constant as in a solid.
The curve then becomes parabolic, which corresponds to a constant star mass density.
After the maximum, the curve is generally flat, the star density is decreasing.
The average distance between galaxies in a cluster is relatively small.
Therefore, interactions between galaxies are quite common, and play an important role in their evolution.
The stars of these interacting galaxies will undergo the crossing without colliding with each other.
However, the gas and dust present in both galaxies will interact.
This can trigger a burst of star formation as the interstellar medium has been disturbed and compressed.
Instead, they will gradually fuse to form a single, larger galaxy.
The mergers bring huge changes to the morphology of the two starting galaxies.
Stars are created in galaxies from the cold gas that formed in the giant molecular clouds.
Some galaxies, the "starburst galaxies", have a vertiginous star formation rate.
Starburst galaxies were more common in the past, and currently contribute about 15% to the total star formation rate.
Starburst galaxies are characterized by high concentrations of gas and dust as well as a high number of young stars.
The most massive of them ionize the surrounding clouds and create HII regions.
These massive stars end up in supernovae, producing a remnant that interacts with the surrounding gas.
This triggers a star-forming chain reaction that propagates through the entire gaseous region.
Such a burst of stars only ends when the available gas is consumed or dispersed.
Starburst are often associated with galaxies in interaction or fusion.
The typical example of galaxy undergoing a starburst is M82, which recently interacted with M81, larger in size.
irregular galaxies often have nodes where the rate of formation is particularly high.
The standard model describing a galaxy is based on the accretion disk present around the supermassive black hole of the galaxy.
Blazars are thought to be active galaxies emitting jets pointed towards the earth.
A radiogalaxy emits radiation located in the radio waves from its jets.
In this area, some theories have become widely accepted, but it is still a very active field of astrophysics.
Agglomerations of baryonic matter condensed inside cold dark matter halos.
These primordial structures will eventually become the galaxies we see today.
The existence of such protogalaxies suggests that they had to develop during the Dark Age.
During this time, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.
Over the next two billion years, the accumulated matter settles in the galactic disk.
The evolution of galaxies can be strongly affected by an interaction or collision.
Fusions of galaxies were common in the past, and most galaxies had particular morphologies.
Given the distance between the stars, the vast majority of star systems will not be disturbed by a collision.
However, the gravitational tearing of gas and interstellar dust produces a long trail of stars.
Such structures, caused by the tidal force, can be seen on Mouse or Antenna Galaxies.
In the past, mergers of two systems of equal size became less common.
At present, most stars are formed in small galaxies, where the cold gas is not exhausted.
Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, produce stars of new generations as long as they have dense molecular hydrogen clouds.
Elliptic galaxies, already largely devoid of this gas, do not form stars.
Most Turkmen gas is exported through the Russian gas pipeline system.
The current era of nascent stars should continue for another hundred billion years.
Most galaxies are gravitationally connected to a number of others.
Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy.
Superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies, themselves isolated or grouped into clusters and groups.
At the scale of the superclusters, the galaxies would be arranged in leaves and filaments, leaving between them huge voids.
The galaxies that compose them interact with each other, and are likely to merge.
Other galaxies can be born from the material not yet condensed in galaxies.
In addition, it is also useful for observing ionized HII regions and dusty arms.
Dust in the interstellar medium is opaque to visible light.
The first non-visual study of galaxies, especially active galaxies, was done on radio waves.
Large radio interferometers have been used to map the jets emitted by active galaxies.
Souchez (pronounce [su Ée]) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.
Entirely destroyed in 1915, during the second Battle of Artois, the city was rebuilt after the war.
Souchez was named to the Order of the Nation in 1920 and received the Croix de Guerre in 1924.
Souchez is a town located in the eastern department of Pas-de-Calais, in the heart of the country of Artois.
Souchez is located north of the plain of Arras, at the foot of the hills of Artois.
The soil of the bed and banks of the Souchez consists of recent alluvial clay or sand from the Holocene era.
The plain of Arras, occupying all the southern part of the commune, is covered with sandy-clay loam of the Pleistocene.
The soils of the hills to the east and north-west of the commune consist of Craiecrata marls dating from Turonian.
The Souchez River, which constitutes the upstream course of De√ªle, crosses the territory of the commune from south-west to north-east.
Because of this distance, the local climate is slightly more continental than that of the coast.
The station is served by TER Nord-Pas-de-Calais and TGV trains from or to Paris.
The habitat consists mainly of single-family homes, lodges and a few low rise residential buildings.
The village of Souchez is mentioned in 540 under the name of "Sabucetum" in the testament of Saint Remi.
Remains of Gallo-Roman houses testify to the occupation of the territory at the beginning of our era.
The testament of the Archbishop of Reims mentions Souchez under the name of "Sabucetum" in 540.
In 1213, Souchez was devastated by the troops of Count Ferrand of Flanders then at war against Philippe Auguste.
"These are not ruins: there is no wall, no street, no shape.
Souchez is nothing but a disgusting porridge of wood, stones, bones, crushed and kneaded in the mud.
As on the sea after a shipwreck, some wrecks lie scattered on a carpet of glistening mud.
The mayor of the commune for the 2014-2020 term, Jean-Marie Alexandre, chairs the municipal council.
INSEE gives the commune code 62 1 45 801.
The commune of Souchez is registered in the directory of companies under the code SIREN 216208017.
The nearest fire and rescue center (CIS) is Li√®vin.
the Arras District Court, the Arras District Court,
However, the High Court had already considered the implications for foreign policy.
the Arras Commercial Court and the Arras Children's Court.
Like the national and departmental distribution, the female population of the municipality is higher than the male population.
The rate (51.5%) is of the same order of magnitude as the national rate (51.6%).
The distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is, in 2007, the following:
The city administers a nursery school, the school "Onesime-Brassart", and an elementary school, the school "Anatole-France".
The closest hospitals are Arras and Lens.
Three doctors, a dentist and a pharmacy are installed in the municipality.
Souchez has a sports hall and a sports field.
The city is covered by the programs of France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais and national channels of TNT.
Born in California to a modest family, Nixon studied at Duke University and became a lawyer.
His involvement in the espionage affair Alger Hiss establishes his reputation as anti-communist and made him known nationally.
His crossing of the desert ended six years later with his election to the White House.
Obama lived in the White House for four years: now the White House lives there.
In domestic politics, his administration supported policies of devolution of power from the federal government to the states.
Although he was president during the Apollo 11 mission, he reduced support for the US space program.
After his departure from power, he enjoyed a grace from his successor, Gerald Ford.
During his retirement, Nixon wrote several books and made many trips abroad to rehabilitate his public image.
The legacy and personality of Nixon continue to be the subject of much debate.
Richard had four brothers: Harold (1909-1933), Donald (1914-1987), Arthur (1918-1925) and Edward (born 1930).
Nixon's parents enrolled him at Whittier High School in September 1928.
He would then return to the grocery store to wash and put them on the shelves before going to school.
There were no student fraternities at the university but literary associations.
After graduating from Duke University, Nixon hoped to join the FBI.
He returned to California and was called to the bar in 1937.
Ryan was long reluctant to marry Nixon and their relationship lasted for two years before she accepted his request.
They had two children, Tricia (born in 1946) and Julie (born in 1948).
and Nixon found a job at the Pricing Administration office.
He was assigned to the tire rationing division where he had to answer the mail.
He did not like this job and four months later he asked to join the US Navy.
His first job was as assistant commander of the Ottumwa Training Air Force Base in Iowa.
Upon his return to the United States, Nixon was appointed officer at Naval Air Station Alameda, California.
They formed a committee to choose a candidate and try to avoid the internal dissensions that had led to the victories of Voorhis.
After a night of hectic discussions within the couple, Nixon enthusiastically responded to Perry.
He flew to California and was chosen by the committee.
He was also a member of the Herter Committee who went to Europe to study the need for American financial aid.
But has Europe's financial aid worked to bring the prospect of peace closer?
Developing nations will need financial assistance to protect the poorest and most vulnerable.
Nixon tried to draw attention to Douglas' Liberal votes in Congress.
In the Senate, Nixon was noted for his opposition to communism.
Nixon also criticized the handling of the Korean War by President Harry S. Truman.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower was chosen by the Republicans in 1952 to run for president.
Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflicts of interest.
The speech, later nicknamed "Checkers Speech", was watched by about 60 million Americans, the largest audience for the time.
Eisenhower had pledged to give Nixon responsibilities that would allow him to be his successor.
Nixon attended the Cabinet and National Security Council meetings he chaired when Eisenhower was away.
The biographer Irwin Gellman declared about his vice-presidency:
On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack and his condition was initially considered critical.
Nixon envisioned a second term, but some of Eisenhower's supporters sought to oust him.
In the spring of 1957, Nixon undertook an important tour abroad, this time in Africa.
Upon his return, he helped move the 1957 Civil Rights Act from Congress to Congress.
On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon began a tour of South America.
In April 1959, while Eisenhower refused a hearing in Castro, Nixon agreed to meet him before his trip to Quebec.
In July 1959, President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the Soviet Union for the opening of the US exhibition in Moscow.
He met with little opposition during the Republican primaries and chose former Massachusetts senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.
His Democratic opponent was John F. Kennedy and none seemed to take the lead in the polls.
Although Goldwater had little chance of winning, Nixon was loyally campaigning for him.
The emissaries of Johnson hoped to obtain the signature of a truce before the election.
He could not, however, make this illegally obtained information public, but informed Humphrey that he chose not to use it.
In his victory speech, Nixon promised that his administration would try to "bring the divided nation together".
He called for transforming partisan politics into a new era of unity:
Kissinger, with whom the president worked closely by bypassing the Cabinet, also played a role in this opening.
Nixon took the opportunity to send Kissinger to China to meet secretly Chinese officials.
In February 1972, Nixon and his wife went to China.
On landing, the president and the first lady stepped out of Air Force One and were greeted by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai.
More than a hundred television journalists accompanied the president.
It also gave him the opportunity to belittle the reporters he despised.
An official dinner was held in the evening in honor of the President in the People's Assembly Palace.
In mid-1969, Nixon began peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese and talks began in Paris.
In July 1969, Nixon visited South Vietnam where he met American commanders and President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu.
Kissinger persuaded him that there were more documents that he had forgotten and the president tried to start his publication.
As the withdrawal of American troops continued, conscription was reduced and ended in 1973.
The truce lasted only two years and the North Vietnamese forces resumed the offensive in March 1975.
After the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration negotiated to make an equivalent visit to the Soviet Union.
Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and a banquet was organized that evening in the Kremlin.
Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta where they discussed a Mutual Defense Pact, Relaxation and MIRVs.
The Nixon administration supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but support was not unconditional.
Nixon considered that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage this process.
The President felt that, with the exception of the Suez Canal crisis, the United States had not intervened with Israel.
Nixon thought, however, that he had to use the massive American military aid to Israel to bring both parties to negotiate.
When the United States and the USSR managed to secure a cease-fire, Israeli forces had made deep progress in the enemy territories.
Nixon converts late to the concept of conservation of Nature.
The environment had not been an important issue in the 1968 elections and candidates were rarely questioned about it.
Nixon rejected these proposals and NASA refocused on the space shuttle program.
The Nixon presidency oversaw the end of racial segregation in public schools in the South.
Hoping to make a good score in the South in 1972, he tried to settle the issue before the election.
Federal funds were available and a meeting with the president could be a reward for local actors.
Warren remained at his post until Nixon named Warren Earl Burger in June 1969.
The latter became known for writing the 1973 "Roe v. Wade" ruling legalizing abortion in the United States.
In September 1971, Judge Hugo Black died and his colleague John Marshall Harlan II resigned for health reasons.
None of these candidates were presented to the Senate and Nixon convinced Lewis F. Powell, Jr.
Rehnquist remained in the Supreme Court until his death in 2005 after becoming Chief Justice in 1986.
Nixon considered that his takeover took place at the time of a major political realignment.
Since the end of the Reconstruction in 1876, the southern United States was a Democratic stronghold called "Solid South".
Nixon's efforts to gain Southerners' support in 1968 were opposed by Wallace's candidacy.
The following month, Nixon was easily chosen at the Republican convention.
The president downplayed the case and described the articles as biased and lying.
Despite the damage caused by the new revelations, Nixon hoped to be able to get through.
The speech was delivered from the Oval Office and broadcast live on television and radio.
Nixon said he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford.
He defended his record as president and declared citing a 1910 speech by Theodore Roosevelt:
After his resignation, Nixon and his wife went to their home in La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California.
Nixon's resignation did not put an end to the many requests to see him sentenced.
The new president Ford planned to pardon him even if it was unpopular.
Nixon, contacted by Ford officials, was initially reluctant and eventually accepted.
This put an end to any possibility of prosecution and Nixon issued a statement:
His doctors gave him the choice between death and surgery and he chose the latter reluctantly.
In December 1974, Nixon began to plan his return despite the country's considerable grudge against him.
He wrote in his diary, referring to Pat and him:
In February 1976, Nixon visited China by personal invitation from Mao.
Nixon did not take a stand in the fight between Ford and Reagan during the 1976 Republican primary.
It was avoided by American diplomats and most of James Callaghan's Labor government ministers.
Nixon spoke to Oxford University's debate group on the Watergate:
Carter did not want to invite the former president but Deng warned that he would visit Nixon in California if he was not invited.
After 18 months in his New York home, Nixon and his wife moved to Saddle River, New Jersey in 1981.
A blood clot that appeared as a result of his heart problems gave way and moved to his brain.
The brain damage caused brain edema and Nixon sank into a deep coma.
Richard Nixon was buried alongside his wife Pat on the grounds of the library bearing his name in California.
Thousands of people waited eight hours in cold, wet weather to pay a last tribute to the former president.
Nixon is credited for his attitude in domestic affairs, which allowed the voting and enforcement of environmental laws.
Nixon's career was frequently affected by his personality and public perception of it.
Nixon had a complex personality, both mysterious and clumsy but remarkably self-revealing.
Even Bebe Rebozo, according to some, his closest friend, did not call him by his first name.
The role of Richard Nixon was interpreted on screen by:
The many personalities that are there as well as the architectural achievements of art nouveau make it an important tourist attraction of Vienna.
It could thus become a major tourist attraction - and finally have a utility.
The reforms led by Emperor Joseph II in 1784 were of particular importance for burials in Vienna.
In addition, the burial was to be conducted in the most economical and functional manner possible.
Some measures had to be withdrawn because of the protests of the population, but the five new cemeteries were still open.
Moreover, given the expansion of the city, we wanted to close these cemeteries as quickly as possible to use the space.
Composed of loess, the soil allows a faster decomposition of corpses and prevents the spread of diseases.
In addition, this type of soil is easy to dig has only low risk of collapse.
The final decision was made in favor of Kaiserebersdorf, district of Simmering.
After three years of work (1871-1874), the new "city of the dead" of Vienna was ready.
In October 1874, two weeks before the inauguration, the city council returned the secular cemetery and prohibited any religious inauguration.
The municipal council finally accepted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreligious inaugurations but still refused the administration of the cemetery by the communities.
That day, Jakob Zelzer was the first person to be buried, followed by 13 other people.
His desolation was blamed, among other things, since at the time, only a scanty vegetation characterized him.
Finally, visitors had to walk a long way because there was no connection between the city and the cemetery.
Thus, the remains of famous people were transferred from different cemeteries to central cemeteries such as Beethoven or Schubert.
The transportation of corpses was another problem that councilors had to solve.
This sight displeased the local population whose morale suffered from this incessant confrontation with death.
In addition, it was regularly the winter that convoys remain blocked because of the snow.
The mayor received many projects, suggestions, proposals to improve the situation, but nothing was achieved.
The transport on horseback continued until 1918, when we used the electrified tram that rolled since the beginning of the century.
The then mayor was summoned before the Constitutional Court, who decided in favor of the crematorium.
It was not until 1966 that the diocese of Vienna accepted cremation as being equal to burial.
The Third Reich and the Second World War left traces on the cemetery.
The burial took place in a closed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cemetery, in the absence of public and under police surveillance.
In 1944, Walter Nowotny, one of the best pilots of the German Air Force was buried in a tomb of honor.
The dome of the church was destroyed by an incendiary bomb, all the buildings of the cemeteries were affected.
In February 1945, the burning chapels were badly hit by bombs.
It is true that Germany has been hit hard, very hard hit by the economic crisis.
Beings were then only possible directly in the grave.
After the war, restoration work was quickly undertaken.
There is still a vacant lot on the site of the ceremonial hall destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.
Many other monuments and war graves recall the memory of many victims of this troubled period.
Ditto in the musical field, the burial of Falco in February 1998 attracted thousands of people.
At that time, the Ministry of Economy opened the sector to competition.
Gardener maintenance and funerary marble are also open to competition.
In the course of its history, the cemetery was enlarged 7 times (the last time in 1921).
The central cemetery is on the southeast border of the city, contrary to what its name might suggest.
It belongs to the district of Simmering, which was not yet part of Vienna at the time of the inauguration of the cemetery.
The main street of Simmering leads directly to the cemetery and therefore contributes greatly to its accessibility.
The closer you get to the cemetery, the higher the density of marble, florist and other businesses. increases.
Because of its size, the cemetery has long avenues that make journeys very long.
The main avenues can be borrowed by cars for a fee.
To make remote burials accessible to people without vehicles, the cemetery has been providing a bus line since 1971.
It crosses a large part of the cemetery to the rhythm of a bus every half hour, except the day of All Saints.
Holders of a ticket for municipal lines are therefore exempt from ticket on this line.
The 71 is often present in the anecdotes and traditional songs of Vienna as the last voyage of the Viennese.
So we can say, familiarly, that someone "took the 71".
In 1901, the electric tramway replaced the railway line.
In 1942, the Wiener Linien had 3 private cars for the transport of corpses.
Even today, the 71 is the most used way to get to the cemetery.
Most of the main cemetery is occupied by Catholic burials.
There are also neighborhoods or cemeteries for other religions:
In everyday life, the "central cemetery" designates both the interdenominational part and the entire cemetery.
As a result, we do not speak of a "Catholic cemetery" to designate the interdenominational part (mainly Catholic).
The Jewish cemetery is the first religious area inaugurated, west of the cemetery, as early as 1879.
At the east end of the cemetery, a "new Jewish cemetery" was built.
The old Jewish cemetery, where Arthur Schnitzler and the new are buried, are by far the largest religious districts.
On May 9, 1895, the church Saint-Lazaez was inaugurated in the Russian orthodox quarter of the cemetery.
The Protestants' proposal to create a larger cemetery in the same place was rejected by the municipality.
Thus, the only solution for Protestants was to settle elsewhere.
The Protestant Cemetery, accessible through Gate 4, was inaugurated in 1904.
It is still in the possession of the Protestant community and is not managed by the municipality.
The cemetery has a church and a chapel since the inauguration.
Karl Friedrich Wolschner and Rupert Diedtel won the competition for the construction of the cemetery.
Given the narrowness of the place, there is only one path in the center, flanked on both sides by burials.
Today, this is only possible on Wednesdays with the authorization of a doctor.
There are some passages for pedestrians connecting the Protestant Cemetery to the Jewish and Main Cemeteries.
The tombs are directed to Mecca according to the Koran, regardless of the route of the paths.
After several delays in the works, the cemetery was inaugurated on October 3, 2008.
After negotiations between representatives of the Buddhist community and the town hall, work began in autumn 2003.
The inauguration caught the attention of the media, as Buddhist cemeteries are rare outside of traditionally Buddhist countries.
The presidents' partners also have the possibility of sitting in the crypt, but with the authorization of the president in office.
If a person concerned dies in the performance of his duties, he has the right to a state burial.
If he dies after the end of his term, then a national burial will honor him.
A national funeral was also organized for former Chancellors Leopold Figl, Julius Raab, Alfons Gorbach, Bruno Kreisky and Fred Sinowatz.
Josef Klaus fut about Lui Burberry in family intimacy, selon sa volont√©.
The central cemetery contains many monuments and tombs or military cemeteries.
The parallel paths that lead to the main gate form a functional grid at right angles.
In addition, 2 wide paths leave the main gate at 45 ¬∞ and enter the cemetery.
The first remarkable construction is the main door, designed by Max Hegele, a student of Victor Lunz and Karl von Hasenauer.
It includes the portal proper and two chapels burning, on both sides of the portal.
For practical reasons, it was Hegel's first buildings in the cemetery.
The geographical and creative center of the cemetery is unquestionably the church designed by Hegele and dedicated to Saint Charles Borromeo.
Built between 1908 and 1910, it is one of the most important art nouveau churches.
He represented in 4 pendants under the dome the 4 Gospels, and also designed the entrances of the side chapels.
For this reason, the church is also known as the "Karl Lueger Church".
The arcades and columbariums next to the church were also made by Hegele, before the church between 1905 and 1907.
Around the church, the arrangement of tombs and paths evokes a belief.
The foot of the cross merges with the entrance to the cemetery.
The long existence of the cemetery allowed him to see the realization of other interesting buildings.

After several unsuccessful attempts, Temenos reconquered the land of his great-grandfather.
It seems in reality that it was not an invasion, but a long assimilation.
Little or nothing is known about this period of its history.
She gradually becomes the rival of Athens to which she delivers the long Peloponnesian War (431 to 404 BC).
During this war, Sparta benefits from the money of Persia, hostile to Athenian pretensions in Ionia.
sharpens the ambition of the Spartans, starting points of the expedition of the Ten Thousand (401-399).
The Persians then decide to finance the enemies of Sparta (Athens, Thebes, then Corinth and Argos).
This Persian policy, of switching between the different cities, reinforces Athens, whose pretensions worry the Persian rulers.
On the occasion of this warming diplomacy, the Peace of Antalcidas of 387 av.
is sworn: Sparta is consecrated hegemon of Greece and arbitrator of the liberties of the Greek world.
Sitting its new status, Sparta installs gradually in all Greek cities rulers in his pay.
In 382, ‚Äã‚Äãshe took control of Thebes whose opponents took refuge in Athens.
In 378 Thebes is liberated, the Spartans hunted with the discreet help of the Athenians.
Sparte, incr√©dule sur le v√©ritable r√¥le jou√© par rivale, lui d√©clare la guerre.
The Athenian confederation is reformed (377), to which Thebes joins Sparta.
Sparta is also driven out of Corcyra, new ally of the Athenians (375).
Further north, Thessaly is unified by Jason de Ph√®res (375/4), posing a new threat to Lacedaemon.
this sacking materializes the end of Spartan supremacy over Greece.
But Sparta is not yet dead: the Theban assault on the city is repulsed by the heroic resistance organized by Agesilaus.
Several Theban expeditions are necessary to prevent it from reestablishing its domination (in 370, 369 ...).
Two years later, Sparta regains his honor at the Mantle Battle of 362 BC.
However, this victory masks the reality of the balance of power: the bulk of the troops were Athenian.
Sous l'Empire Roman, Sparte ben√©ficie du statut avantageux de cit√© libre keeps you from specific institutions.
Spartan citizens represent only a small part of the overall population of the city.
Again, it is hard to believe this round number.
The first reliable mention is that provided by Herodotus: in 480 BC.
Aristotle assures that of his time there are barely a thousand citizens.
They do not stop being citizens, but become second-class citizens.
To be a Spartan citizen, four conditions must be met:
They are not slaves-goods, but their status is often close to medieval serfs:
Exceptionally, they are enlisted to fight, and can be freed afterwards.
More numerous than the "Homoioi", they underwent the reform of Lycurgus being sidelined.
Fearing their revolt, the Spartans solemnly declare war on them every year, degrade them permanently and terrorize them.
However, they are free and citizens of their own cities.
They hold the monopoly of the trade and share that of the craft with the Hilotes.
Symbol of the "Spartan exception", it is also poorly known: most sources are late.
According to Plutarch, the Spartan newborn is examined by a commission of elders to determine if he is handsome and well trained.
It also includes learning music and dance, which are essential for religious holidays.
Spartan women are also distinguished from other Greek women by their marriage.
But unlike Athens, eunomia is synonymous with great discipline.
All the components of the city make sacrifices: royalty, aristocracy, the people.
The Lycurgus system coexists elements of four regimes:
It is the creation of this class of citizens, by the absorption of the landed aristocracy into the popular mass, which founds the isonomy.
This absorption has been pushed very far, in order to create total equality:
The projects put in shape by the gerontia are submitted to him.
It approves or not, without discussing them (no citizen speaks), the amendments proposed by the ephors.
For Aristotle, the assembly has such a weak power that it does not even mention it as a democratic element of the Spartan regime.
Families can not marry each other, and their graves are in different places.
Nevertheless, it seems that the Spartans liberally interpret this rule of succession.
At first they can wage war against the country of their choice, and their power is collegial.
AD, it is the "divorce of Eleusis" and thereafter, the kings lead campaign alone.
Be that as it may, the king in the field is the commander-in-chief.
Chosen according to their military virtue, the gerontons belong for the most part to the great families of Sparta.
However, every citizen, without condition of fortune or rank, can be a candidate.
They play an eminent political role: they alone are able to prepare the laws, and to have the initiative.
The five ephors are a directory which constitutes real antagonists to kings.
They are elected for a year by the assembly, and not re-eligible.
Susceptible to being chosen among citizens of modest extraction, they are an element of egalitarianism in Spartan society.
In fact, they are supposed to represent the people: Cicero compares them to the plebs of the plebs.
Every month, kings swear to respect the laws, and the ephors to maintain the kingship.
Sparta's economic model is based on a particularly strong counter-economic ideology.
In theory, it is forbidden for "Homoioi" (Peers) to exercise a productive activity, exclusive domain of the Perieces and the Hilotes.
The latter are responsible for exploiting the "kleros" (lot of land) of Homoioi, to which they pay a rent ("apophora").
Like the Greeks in general, the Perieces are devoted mainly to agriculture, and probably also to crafts and commerce.
In theory always, money is banned by a triple series of measures.
In the first place, it is rendered useless; meals are assured in common; luxury and frivolous arts are banned.
In fact, most historians agree that the archaic Sparta did not have a law prohibiting money.
We need more monetary historians and historians of economic thought and fewer model designers.
Several testimonies also attest that the Lacedaemonians use in the classical era minted coins.
In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, the city wonders about the opportunity to issue a coin of silver.
Despite the egalitarianism of the Lycurgean reform, wealth is distributed very unequally among the Spartans.
Herodotus can thus evoke individuals "of a distinguished birth, and the richest of the city.
Subsequently, Sparta creates units of Neodamods, Hilotes carrying heavy armor, used in reinforcement and garrison.
They are spreading in order of age, so young people are in first place.
Conversely, those who survive are suspicious; the banishment of the social body awaits the cowards, the "tr√©santes".
This heroic ideology is not without practical motives: the effectiveness of the phalange rests on its cohesion.
To remain firm at his post is therefore a civic duty, but also a guarantee of survival.
Religion occupies in Sparta a more important place than in other cities.
Athena, under a great number of epicleses, is the most honored of all.
Another special feature is the worship of the heroes of the Trojan War.
Achille is, according to Anaxagoras, "honored as a god," and he has two sanctuaries.
In the same way, Agamemnon, Cassandra (under the name of Alexandra), Clytemnestra, Menelaus and Helena are venerated.
Sparta also makes an important cult to Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, twin sons of Zeus.
Pindar makes them "stewards of Sparta", and tradition makes the city their birthplace.
Finally, Heracles is also in Sparta a kind of national hero.
It is he who built the temple of Asclepius in the city.
Thus, we find survivals of non-anthropomorphic cults: Boiai, in Laconia, venerates a myrtle under the name of Artemis Soteira.
From him are preserved fragments of eleven elegies, which reconcile the aristocratic ideal inherited from Homer and the ideal of the city.
The speaker Lycurgus notes that the Spartans going to war meet to listen to his poems.
Sparta also knows how to bring recognized poets, such as Thal√©tas, Terpandre or Timoth√©e de Milet.
Curiously, Sparta does not come any more poets after the arrival of St√©sichore and raises no author in her bosom.
The illiteracy of the Spartans was proverbial in the classical period among the Athenians.
Plutarch also quotes letters sent by Spartan mothers to their child soldiers.
It is difficult to know if these two mentions are authentic or not.
In a more credible way, Aristophanes evokes a Spartan poetess, Clitagora, and Jamblicus mentions several Spartan Pythagoreans.
In Roman times, Sparta became one of the Greek centers of higher education.
Laconian art flourishes especially in the archaic period; its main modes of expression are ceramics, bronze and ivory.
Outside Sparta is also the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia.
The Laconian II retains orientalising patterns but introduces the black figure, almost exclusively for export.
; its outlets are mainly Taranto, colony of Sparta, but also Etruria, Cyrenaica or the delta of the Nile.
During the same decade, the export of Laconian figurative pottery also came to an end, supplanted by black lacquer ware.
Sparta is also distinguished, in the archaic period, by his bronze work.
However, no city has a similar constitution, even among those that adopt an oligarchic form.
The first of these "laconizers" is Cimon, who calls his son Lacedaemonios and persuades in 464 BC.
his fellow citizens to help Sparta, struck by an earthquake.
AD, is described as a "notorious laconizer", for whom the constitution of Sparta is the best of all.
Many Greeks attribute victory to the superiority of the Spartan political organization.
Plato is well acquainted with laconizers for having used them extensively during his youth.
Geriatrics is not spared: its members are senile, corrupt and inclined to favoritism.
In the Hellenistic period, Sparta is an object of interest to lovers of political philosophy, which tend to idealize it.
BC, high priest Jason, deposed, wins Sparta in the hope of finding refuge thanks to this common kinship.
In Italy, the Sabines think they are the descendants of Spartans having left their mother city out of disgust for its austerity.
During the Empire, the Stoics admire the Spartans' austerity, their refusal to acknowledge defeat and their contempt for death.
Plutarch wrote the biography of Lycurgus, Agesilaus II, Lysander, Agis IV and Cleomenes III, and collected the Lacedaemonian apophthegms.
"Should prisoners of Sphactery be punished for cowardice?
In the Renaissance, Sparta, and not Athens, is considered the archetype of the moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof antiquity.
The Italian humanist Vergerio extols the educational merits of Sparta in his treatise (about 1402) concerning the education of young princes.
The Spartan model is then diffused under the influence of many translations of Plutarch.
The French Revolution refers much to Sparta until the fall of Robespierre.
In reaction, it was then the turn of the counterrevolutionary theorist Joseph de Maistre to return to the Spartan referent.
For him, the misfortune of Sparta is to have matured too soon.
Due to this use by the far right, Sparta became taboo in the historiographic milieu until the 1980s.
In France, the Bloc identitaire therefore has plenty of Spartan references.
One of the first Westerners to visit Sparta was, in 1436, Cyriaque of Ancona.
One of Roe's agents explored the Aegean Islands, Athens and Sparta.
His death in Patras before he could send his cargo to Roe prevents him from knowing more.
On the contrary, the description by the British trader, Bernard Randolph, dating from 1687 is reliable.
But he was more interested (as a trader) in economic realities than in antiquities.
He tells us that the Plain of Sparta "is pleasant, full of small villages, olive trees and mulberry trees".
His first letter from Sparta is dated April 20, 1730.
It may have been for this reason that Fourmont began to supply absence by invention.
The plant is now the second largest in the world in installed capacity and remains the first in cumulative amount of energy produced.
The second possibility is a world in which powerful central governments use big data to strengthen their control.
Ninety percent of the plant's output is consumed in Brazil.
The construction of the hydroelectric facility is the result of long negotiations between the two countries in the 1960s.
The terms of the treaty, which expires in 2023, are the subject of general discontent in Paraguay.
Teams from the Itaipu environment sector have been working to save hundreds of animal species in the region.
The first eighteen units were installed at the rate of two or three per year.
In addition, the area has been submerged, destroying some of the fauna and flora.
A large part of the displaced families lived on the edge of the Paran√° River.
Some families took refuge in Medianeira, a town not far from the confluence of Paran√° with its tributary Igua√ßu.
The water mirror of the plant drowned various properties of inhabitants of the far west of the state of Paran√°.
The allowances allowed farmers to buy new land.
In 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Itaipu Dam as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
He also inspired the symphony "Itaipu" by Philip Glass, who visited the book in 1988.
In computing, memory is an electronic device that is used to store information.
The memories are sold in the form of spare parts of computer hardware, or electronic components.
The most common technology uses digital electronic semiconductors sometimes associated with mechanical components.
The most common uses are RAM and mass memory.
In most memories, the information is classified by addresses, with the exception of content-addressable memories.
In the past, read-only memories contained complete "plug-and-play" programs for a quick start.
In the course of history, various memory technologies have emerged.
Ferrite core memories are nonvolatile RAMs used in the 1960s to 1970s.
These components are made of a network of copper wire interwoven with ferromagnetic ceramic rings.
This technology has been replaced by semiconductors and integrated circuits.
The use of CMOS technology has made components much less greedy.
Reducing the number of electrons required to store a bit increases the speed of memory.
A number of advances in storage are needed for these intermediate sources of clean energy.
The abacus is a primary form of mechanical digital information storage.
Ribbons and punch cards have historically been the first mass media.
Magnetic and electronic recordings permanently supplant cards and ribbons.
Mechanisms similar to those of mechanical calculators allow manipulation of information.
There have also been bubble memories which, after raising great hopes, have only been briefly marketed.
As long as photography alone makes it possible to use light for writing, the optical medium remains sparse.
In the 1990s, the laser reading and writing disc made it possible to use the optical medium for computing more generally.
Since then, the media using lasers are widespread: CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-Ray and proprietary formats.
The magnetic core technique used the ability of a ferrite core to retain binary magnetic information.
However, it has a huge advantage: keep this information for several years without any power supply.
The memories thus produced can be classified into two families: the SRAMs and the ROMs:
Each memory box consists of a fuse possibly burned during programming, by the application of a suitable voltage.
These memories have a number of advantages over more volatile memories, such as their robustness in an aggressive environment (ex.
spatial); their content is however unalterable after their first programming.
This House of Solomon will inspire the creation of the Royal Society in 1660.
But while Bacon can symbolize an important moment in the institutionalization of research, he is not the only founder.
His texts reflect an idea that crystallizes in his time, and begins to manifest across Europe.
The Frascati manual, to satisfy statistical needs, defines several types of research:
Depending on the different forms of research encountered, different kinds of norms and rules govern scientific practices.
These standards and rules are not always legal.
The sociology of science thus reports the existence of norms specific to the scientific field.
The different forms of research are also distinguished by the different "technical" standards that guide intellectual activity.
It is the purpose of regional epistemologies to analyze and understand these local epistemic imperatives.
Similarly, the "scientific method" is not the same according to the different research regimes.
Scientific research is usually written in special places, which provide researchers with the means to carry out their activity.
These places may be laboratories, but this is not always the case.
Laboratories, which may be public or private, are the privileged places where the research activity takes place.
These researchers share the resources and resources gathered in the laboratory.
There are laboratories for both the exact sciences and the humanities and social sciences.
The size, type and structure of laboratories can vary considerably depending on the means and needs.
This is obvious for the philosopher, but it may be the case of the mathematician, the sociologist, the historian.
Finally, this knowledge can be incorporated into new machines, instruments or devices.
New machines and new qualifications reflect the emergence of new manufacturing techniques and new products.
Scientific researchers publish their work in various categories of publications:
Patents began to multiply in the world of research in the 1980s.
Naturally, they remain a product more characteristic of private research than of public research.
The academic world, however, is developing this form of publication of its work.
Scientific research brings together different trades: researchers of course, but also engineers, technicians, administrators ...
A researcher does not necessarily have a status that recognizes the specificity of his profession.
A researcher is one whose professional function is to contribute in an original way to the production of scientific knowledge.
He may not have the title of researcher, but be considered as such by the scientific community.
It is not uncommon for engineers to have a real research activity, publish articles and develop original works.
One of the engineers whose research is best known is Claude Shannon and his mathematical theory of communication.
The distinction between support staff and researcher almost always refers to a statutory difference.
Most of the research is now privately funded.
Thus they represent more than 10 billion euros for France over the period 2007-2013.
Private funds are all technical and financial means not derived from state aid.
In the majority of cases, it is the personal property of the researchers or donations of those around them.
This funding consists of staff salaries, when they are on permanent contracts or have the status of civil servant.
This recurrent funding also includes laboratory endowments and equipment (scientific instruments, computers, offices, premises).
Groups of researchers interested in the proposal will then apply for the project to be assigned to them.
In France, most university laboratories now use this type of funding to increase their research capacity.
The public organizations best known for their contract financing activity are the official state agencies.
Scientific projects are presented by consortia composed of several laboratories and companies working together on their realization.
In France, the purpose of the National Research Agency is to finance research projects.
Private contract financing is the result of companies wishing to introduce technological innovations into their product catalogs.
The laboratory of the Nobel physicist Albert Fert, for example, is funded in part by Thales.
Research teams may also be composed in part by CIFRE PhD students.
The PhD student is an employee of the company, he spends part of his time in the public laboratory.
In return, the employer company receives financial assistance from the ANRT.
Contract financing, which is constantly increasing, considerably increases the number of contract employees in the laboratories.
Laboratories may file patents on processes developed as part of their research.
In the rest of the world, this method of financing has been in effect for many years.
The forms of evaluation of research differ very significantly by sector.
They can cover several levels: the researchers themselves, their laboratories and the institutions hosting these laboratories.
This assessment can be done on an individual or collective basis.
The need for human and material resources can then be evaluated.
An application for funding must be submitted to a research funding agency.
The success of this request will depend on the scientific policy choices of the organization.
Large research laboratories are usually grouped within larger institutions: companies, hospitals, universities, research centers.
It is primarily at the level of these institutions that scientific research is organized.
However, these institutions do not always have the autonomy to define the organization of their research.
It has substantial resources but little room for maneuver as it is linked under a profit and loss contract.
For its part, the research is conducted in technical high schools, associations for scientific purposes, appentris ...
Any useful place found by members of the research team.
It has low resources and therefore limited time, but a complete autonomy of decision.
Some activities are competitions and gatherings for recreation and sport.
Companies and organizations sometimes use them to find new talent or new ideas.
His only path to success is Public Necessity or the creation of a business.
There are indeed problems of recognition of the result and the cost of potential patents.
These structures can be science parks, technopoles or business incubators.
In particular, questions arise concerning the steering of research and the main strategic orientations.
The repercussions resulting from scientific progress are of several kinds, benefiting different actors:
These benefits make scientific research desirable, as it does not violate the principles of ethics and precaution.
The game of interests of potential beneficiaries therefore leads political and economic decision makers to organize and finance research.
The organization and financing of research must therefore allow the autonomy of science.
Thus, nuclear energy has the advantage of being inexpensive, but the fate of highly toxic radioactive waste is problematic.
A political decision, based on an assessment of the acceptability of these risks, can then be made.
More generally, researchers are likely to overstate scientific progress for itself.
In 1955, the Russell-Einstein manifesto gave birth to the Pugwash movement, whose lectures wanted to be the moral conscience of scientists.
Part of our moral conscience and our moral motivations are the product of biological evolution.
In 1994, UNESCO's bioethics unit identified more than 200 national ethics committees.
For example, it is obvious that a researcher should not be influenced by commercial interests.
Nor should it be influenced by dogmas, whether ideological or religious.
Finally, it must not be influenced by a change of government or a foreign state.
A compromise is therefore essential between freedom and control of research.
However, these are totally different phenomena, which are not always pathological.
Scientific research does not involve the application of an infallible method.
It feeds on the errors and mistakes of researchers, whose approach is often fundamentally uncertain.
The big discoveries are rarely the fruit of a pre-established program, they often appear unexpectedly.
This peculiarity of scientific research bears a name: it is serendipity.
History shows that the greatest scientists are not immune to errors.
But again, we must beware of a unilateral and anachronistic view of fraud.
The standards surrounding the administration of evidence are not what they were yesterday.
We could tolerate yesterday to retouch some data, this is not the case today.
Teams and laboratories are competing, and everyone tries to appear as the best.
It is rare for fraud to be detected at the time of the evaluation.
In recent years, a number of frauds have hit the headlines.
In 1991, the Geological Society of France rehabilitated a scientist convicted of fraud in 1919: Jacques Deprat.
Controversy is a very important element of the dynamics of science.
His name is irremediably attached to the wars of Religion opposing Catholics and Protestants.
Today, the historiographical tendency rehabilitates it, and recognizes in it one of the greatest queens of France.
The Medici played an important role during Catherine's childhood.
The movement played an important role during the Cold War.
Catherine was then only ten years old and will remain all her life marked by the political cruelty of this conflict.
Placed under the direct protection of the Pope, she receives a very careful education.
It benefits from a refined culture, imbued with humanism and Neoplatonism.
Catherine became dauphine Viennese and titular Duchess of Brittany (1536-1547).
But Catherine and Henri still have no heirs (they will take ten years to have one).
But she receives the unexpected support of Diane de Poitiers, her own cousin and Henri's.
Noted for her intelligence, Catherine is appreciated by the king, her father-in-law.
Sharing with her sister-in-law Marguerite de France a taste for arts and letters, Catherine becomes her friend.
With the Queen of Navarre Marguerite d'Angoul√™me, she participated in the cultural elevation of the court, including literary compositions.
It is at this time that Catherine chooses her own emblem: the scarf of Iris (the rainbow).
His birth, followed the following year by that of a daughter, baptized Elizabeth, reinforces the position of Catherine at court.
On June 10, 1549, Catherine is officially crowned Queen of France at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.
The role conferred on him at court is that of procreation.
In the space of fifteen years, Catherine will give birth to ten children, seven of whom survived.
The difficulties of giving birth to twins in 1557 put an end to these successive maternities.
In her house, Catherine gathered around her a court where she placed many Italian compatriots.
At the accession of Henry II, Catherine must suffer the presence of the royal favorite Diane de Poitiers.
Diane de Poitiers exerts an important influence on the king and receives in return many responsibilities.
She thus obtained the charge of the education of the royal children and the title of Duchess of Valentinois.
Catherine is appointed regent and with the help of Constable Anne de Montmorency, she ensures the supply and strengthening of armies.
She is sent by the king to ask the city of Paris the money necessary to continue the campaign.
It marks his opposition to the constable and his rapprochement with the Guise clan.
So, that his second daughter, Claude, married the Duke Charles III of Lorraine
Coming from the house of Lorraine and related to the royal family, the Guise are rich and powerful.
Catherine supports them and approves the setting aside by them, the constable and Diane de Poitiers.
It itself intervenes in the redistribution of royal favors by exchanging with the old favorite the castle of Chenonceau against that of Chaumont.
The contemporaries emphasized the extreme pain of the queen at the death of the king.
The reign of Francis II is marked by the rise of religious violence.
The death of the latter encourages Protestants to claim freedom of conscience and worship.
Although their leader Calvin condemns the violence, a minority of reformers want to fight by force.
Faced with the growing threat, the Guise are in favor of a policy of repression.
Gradually, she becomes the strongest supporter of supporters of civil tolerance (also called averagers).
Struck by the injunction of the preachers, she fully approved the sanction of troublemakers.
Hitherto reserved and marked by the pain of grief, the queen-mother is more involved in business.
The rise of the moderating party increases its political influence and the party of repression is forced to listen more.
She surrounds herself with moderate advisers in favor of the Reformation and favors their ideas within the royal council.
In June, it allows the jurist Michel de L'Hospital, opposed to the repression, to be named Chancellor of France.
The younger brother of the king ascends the throne under the name of Charles IX.
As he is only ten years old and still a minor, Catherine de Medici is declared regent.
In the face of religious unrest, she set up a conciliation policy with the support of moderate counselors.
The failure of his policy, however, led him to harden several times his position with regard to Protestants.
To improve the lot of her subjects ready to tear each other apart, Catherine de M√©dicis multiplies the negotiations and the assemblies of decision.
As early as December 1560, the Estates General regrouping the three orders of the society had been held at Orleans.
This edict is part of the policy concorde wanted by Catherine de Medici and Michel de L'Hospital.
For her, the mission of political leaders is primarily to break the cycle of violence that ravaged the kingdom.
But the January Edict fails because of the strong antagonisms between Protestants and Catholics.
A triumvirate composed of the three old favorites of Henry II is opposed to the policy of tolerance of the queen-mother.
Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre chooses the camp of the catholics.
She hopes for support from Prince de Conde, the leader of the Protestants.
The queen initially refused the march to war that provoked in March 1562 the massacre of Wassy.
On March 31 he landed at Fontainebleau where the royal family was and forced him to follow him to Paris.
For several months, she intervened actively in the logistical organization to defeat the Protestants.
The death and imprisonment of the main warlords finally allows him to bring peace.
While distancing herself from the Guise, she granted the Huguenots the peace of Amboise in March 1563.
The edict already provides for a certain freedom of worship in the seigniorial houses and in the cities.
Catherine abandons the regency, but Charles IX immediately confirms it in her powers.
For Catherine, it is time for reconstruction, because the civil war has caused great destruction.
Its aim is also to provoke the meeting of the European heads of state and revive a new council.
The queen had not accepted that during the Council of Trent, Protestants were not invited.
In 1567, the prince of Conde tried to seize the king by surprise.
Catherine imputes to Chancellor L'Hospital the failure of the policy of civil tolerance and returns it in May 1568.
The royal power decides to end the rebels and terrible wars ensue, ruining the country.
Everyone should be able to decide whether to share them or not, and decide only how to share them.
Catherine urges Protestants to accept the peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which grants them a very limited freedom of worship.
The death in June 1572 of the Queen of Navarre Jeanne d'Albret, an important political rival on the Protestant side, suits her.
The massacre of St. Bartholomew has sparked an important historiographical debate.
Contradictory historical arguments have long clashed over the Queen's responsibility in this massacre.
Today, historians no longer consider that the massacre could have been premeditated.
Faced with an explosive situation, the queen and the king decided to make an exceptional decision.
The court of Catherine de Medici is a succession of parties, balls and games.
Catherine's children participate in dances and disguise themselves in performances that underline the unity of the royal family.
Excellent cavalier, it is sometimes attributed the importation in France of the way to ride "amazon".
She imposed the corset and underpants during horseback riding to the ladies of her yard.
His policy of staging the monarchy was coupled with a passion for the arts.
She was interested in goldsmithing and music as well as in painting and architecture.
At his death, his collection of portraits included between 600 and 700 drawings, now scattered around the world.
Catherine also protected men of letters like Montaigne or Ronsard.
There were three recumbent royal couple including those made by the Primatice and Germain Pilon.
Except the castle of Chenonceau, nothing remains of its many construction sites.
Known as the favorite, and perhaps the most intelligent, son, the new king intends to rule by himself.
Catherine continues to exercise power, but she can no longer act without the consent of the king.
As the king is in Poland when Charles IX dies, Catherine is declared regent by the parliament.
It encourages justice to proceed to its execution which takes place on June 26, 1574.
During his return, the king began to distribute the public posts to the members of his entourage.
She enters into opposition with her son on the distribution of the dignities of the court.
Catherine must also accept that her son releases her from power.
Catherine de Medici is sad for some time to be deprived of power by her favorite son.
During the reign of Henry III, Catherine remained more active than ever in the government.
An extraordinary diplomat, she intervenes mainly to accommodate or moderate the enemy parties.
She leads the negotiations and travels the kingdom to enforce the edicts of peace and the authority of the king.
Despite her rheumatism, Catherine continues her journey in litter and mule.
At the end of her tour, in 1579, Catherine is pleased to have restored the agreement in her family.
Despite her reluctance, she ended up supporting the plans of her son Fran√ßois to become the sovereign of the Netherlands.
At the age of seventy, she does not hesitate to pay for himself.
In 1585, she left in the east to remind the Guise to order.
In 1586, she began negotiations with her son-in-law Henry, king of Navarre, in the south-west.
Catherine then undertakes her final journey when the court goes to Blois for the meeting of the States General.
His remains will only be relocated to Saint-Denis twenty-two years later.
She also refused to go to the royal castle of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
The personality of Catherine de Medici is difficult to grasp because a black legend has always been associated with her image.
This historical misinformation has remained intact for a long time because historians have themselves conveyed this image without any concern for objectivity.
From the time of the Wars of Religion, Catholics and Protestants have mocked the policy of tolerance of the queen-mother.
A real propaganda work against the Valois has conveyed a very mistaken image of the queen.
The death of the last of the Valois in 1589 did not allow its rehabilitation.
It is the French Revolution that gives the black legend of Catherine de Medici its definitive appearance.
When Catherine becomes regent of France, she governs for her children who are too young to rule by themselves.
This is where the legend of an upstart and despotic queen was born.
As queen mother, she wants to preserve the royal heritage of her children.
Catholics reproached him for giving the Protestants too much freedom, the Protestants not giving enough.
Novelists and cinema are largely responsible for this black legend of the queen mother.
Their responsibilities were largely removed and the perpetrators were discredited.
Iconography sometimes represents it in front of the corpses of the Huguenots massacred in the courtyard of the Louvre.
The adversaries of Catherine reproached him for skewing between the parties, and even creating discord to better rule.
When she arrived in France to marry the Duke of Orleans, she could barely speak French.
It is true that Catherine had no sympathy for what she called "the king's whore".
Several actresses have embodied the role of Catherine de Medici, which has inspired many directors.
This symbiosis results from an association (called lichenization or lichenization) between the photobiont and one or more generally two mushrooms.
He used to designate all the epiphytic structures, including the encrusting lichens, presented as dartres.
The advent of high-performance microscopes made it possible to highlight the biological interactions in this organism.
There is a correlation between their abundance and previously unexplained variations of the phenotype.
The seaweed is made up of chlorophyllian cells called gonidia.
When the photobiont is a cyanobacterium, it is also an optional symbiote.
Lichen has three reproductive modes: vegetative reproduction, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Vegetative reproduction is done by simple fragmentation of the thallus (cuttings phenomenon) or with the help of specialized organs:
These organs form a set of characters widely used in taxonomy.
They feed from the atmosphere (minerals in the form of solutes in rainwater).
They are very slow growth, of the order of a few millimeters per year.
For example, "Rhizocarpon geographicalum" is a lichen that grows by a few hundredths of a millimeter a year.
This structure can vary considerably in the same species of lichen according to its substrate, moisture.
There are six types of lichens according to the overall appearance of their thallus:
With regard to the relations between the mycobionte and the phytobionte, one distinguishes three cases of figure:
Lichens have the capacity to withstand very strong desiccations (poikilohydric properties).
Some lichens can live with a water content of 2%.
Most people can live without a kidney, while no one can live without eating.
In addition, lichens accumulate polyols, which serve as a reserve of water.
The lichen regains its metabolic capacity from five to thirty minutes after rehydration.
In 2005, two species of lichens were sent into space and exposed to vacuum for two weeks.
The following butterflies (classified by family) feed on lichen:
Other animals, such as mammals such as yak or reindeer, consume lichens.
This characteristic sometimes makes it possible to date their support by the ratio size and speed of growth.
Eight percent of terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by lichens.
For example, they account for 65% of the flora at the edge of the Arctic polar desert.
It is an organism without borders, colonizing the polar circle whose summer is short, as much as the north of the temperate forests.
Wet areas, sometimes dry further south, have their lichen varieties.
In the ecosystem, lichens are one of the sometimes important components of biodiversity.
In mineral environments, they are the first to appear with moss and then humus.
They are capable of stockpiling and accumulating mineral compounds, far beyond the needs of their bodies.
Many lichens are "pollution indicators" used for biomonitoring.
Lichens contain a mucilaginous amylaceous substance, lichenine, which has been shown to have nutritional and medicinal properties.
Some lichens contain lichenin macromolecules degraded to glucose during digestion.
The usnea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe human skull ("Usnea plicata") collected on the skull of the hanged, was paid at the price of gold to heal, it was believed, epilepsy.
Its antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, photoprotective (Usnea longissima) or photostimulatory properties are being tested.
Other species are used traditionally, especially in Scandinavia: "Rocella phycopsis", "Rocella fuciformis", "Ochrolechia tartarea", "Pertusaria dealbescens", "Parmelia glabratula" subsp.
"Xanthoria" pounded and mixed with urine were used to dye the wool in pink, including Scottish kilt.
Up to nine thousand tons per year of lichens are harvested to produce essential oils of perfume.
It has been said before that no lichen was really poisonous, with the exception of some intestinal disorders caused by very bitter species.
The toxic principle would act by inhibition of respiration, resulting in death.
Since, as for mushrooms, the list of toxic lichens continues to grow, among which:
The classification of Alexander Zahlbruckner (1860-1938) (1907, 1926), despite his seniority, retains practical value in the face of recent, often incomplete, classifications.
It breaks down the class of lichens according to the following scheme:
Hayek lived in Austria, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and was naturalized British in 1938.
Affecting many fields of knowledge, he also studies psychology and economics.
He considered that a good economist should be interested in all fields of knowledge.
From 1923 to 1924, Hayek was assistant to Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks of New York University.
He also attends courses at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.
He is so successful that he is later appointed professor at the LSE.
Refusing to join Austria annexed by the Germans, he acquired in 1938 British nationality.
Hayek will also regret his entire life for having declined invitations to counter-argue over Keynesian policies.
In 1944 appeared his most read book, "The Road of Bondage".
It is an analysis of totalitarianism that is positioned against the mainstream ideologies that dominate the era, Nazism and communism.
The coercive power of the state transforms any economic or social issue into a political issue.
He never fully understood the political and economic issues underlying the bankruptcy laws.
It is a commercial success translated into 20 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand having experienced more than 30 re-releases in the United States.
Its shortened edition in the "Readers' Digest" in 1945 touched about 600,000 American readers.
If the book makes him known to the general public, he acquires a reputation as a polemicist who serves him in the academic world.
He will spend the next decades away from the mainstream university.
Later, Hayek felt that at that time his work "discredited" him in academic circles.
In April 1947, he co-founded the Mont-P√®lerin Society, an international association of intellectuals wishing to promote liberalism.
He is president from 1947 to 1961 and remains very influential until his death.
Refused to the economics department, he teaches "social thoughts".
His position is unpaid but he is financed by sponsors, including the "Liberty Fund".
If he rubs shoulders with economists like Milton Friedman, his interests are more oriented towards psychology and political philosophy.
From 1962 to 1968, when he stopped teaching, he was a professor at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau.
However, he will remain a visiting professor at the University of Salzburg until 1992.
This theory of the situation, earned him the "Nobel Prize for Economics".
He accuses him, however, of having declared "always having been and always wanting to remain an immoralist".
The supposed connection between Hayekian evolutionism and the Scottish Enlightenment (David Hume, Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith) is, however, much disputed.
The main advantage he recognizes for democracy is to allow a peaceful transition to the top of political power.
It is "something precious, and deserves to fight to keep it".
But a dictatorship can be a necessary system for a transitional period.
Sometimes it is necessary for a country to have, for a time, some form of dictatorial power.
At the same time, Arab countries need to harmonize their current aid efforts.
[...] "Personally I prefer a liberal dictator rather than a democratic government lacking liberalism."
The military regime lasts from 1973 to 1989 and is fit from thousands of victims.
Hayek considers that the citizens of Western societies have ceased to be independent by becoming dependent on the benevolence of the state.
Similarly, David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's most influential financier in 1981, was a well-known disciple of Hayek.
Thus Hayek remarks in his essay that "until the development of socialism, he opposed liberalism".
The term libertarian should be used in its place, a term that Hayek considers "singularly unattractive".
He adds "what I believe differs as much from true conservatism as from socialism".
They do not have faith in the spontaneous forces of social adjustment.
Similarly, for Philippe L√©g√©, the analysis of the Hayekian defense of the market order reveals "a fundamental contradiction.
Economists claiming Keynes frequently oppose Hayek's theories and in particular challenge his reading of crises.
For Krugman, it is exactly the opposite that has occurred, the crisis being directly at the origin of high deficits.
For Hayek, over-indebtedness is the result of too easy credit with low interest rates, which generates excessive investments.
Since interest rates are already low, monetary policy is necessarily limited.
However, in his defense, low interest rates were needed to maintain expansion.
Hayek's austerity is opposed to the revival by the expenditure of Keynes.
However some authors contest the theory developed by Hayek, based on them on a misunderstanding of information theory.
Hayek's article "Denationalization of Money" may have influenced the creation of virtual currencies like Bitcoin.
It is located in Paris, in the Flora Wing of the Louvre Palace.
On 25 November 1997, the school became a public administrative institution by ministerial decree.
Since 2002, Philippe Durey, curator general of the heritage, is director of the school.
Thanks to the introduction of the probationary test in 1994, the school's enrollments remain roughly constant.
The school curriculum comprises three study cycles, on the European LMD scheme (Bachelor, Master, PhD).
Today 1/5 of the candidates are admitted, among them the future graduates represent only 1/3 of the workforce.
Other general courses on creative techniques, iconography, and history of collections are also provided.
At the same time, undergraduate students are required to choose one or two specialties from 31 subjects:
In September 2007 began the course of history of fashion and costume.
Live language courses (English, German, Spanish, Italian, French-foreign language) are now mandatory.
Shorter, the second cycle corresponds to the beginnings of research and more professional aims.
In first year, the core curriculum consists of several courses for the first semester:
In the second year of the second cycle there are five courses:
This second year ends with a "graduate degree from the √âcole du Louvre".
The professional opportunities of the √âcole du Louvre are organized around many axes:
"Without passion, it does not make sense to engage in this type of study.
Young people are losing more and more historic and iconographic references, so these sectors are becoming very difficult to approach.
The director of a museum is an art historian but he is also a business leader.
This is one of only two preparatory classes for the competitions.
They do not pass an exam, but are generally present for their pleasure, in order to enrich their culture.
Also offered are summer courses as well as courses in the regions (more than 25 cities and partner museums).
The region is also in the grip of an arms race, mainly at sea.
At the national level, the Louvre School signed a double-degree partnership with ESSEC in 2010.
The √âcole du Louvre has also developed several partnerships with foreign organizations.
Since 1997, the Universit√© de Montr√©al has been welcoming a small group of museology students each year from July to September.
It also organizes, in partnership with the Instituto Veneto, seminars on the history of Venetian art.
Henri Verne, Edmond Pottier, Alfred Merlin, and "alii" "The School of the Louvre, 1882-1932", Paris: Library of the School of the Louvre, 1932.
The Warsaw Pact consisted of a preamble and eleven articles.
It was prepared in four copies, one in Russian, one in Polish, one in Czech and one in German.
The Warsaw Treaty proclaimed itself open to all States "irrespective of their social and political system".
The accession of new members, however, remained subject to the consent of the signatory States (art.
The People's Republic of China, whose observer participated in the pact sessions, ceased to be represented in 1962.
It remained in force for the next ten years for States which had not denounced it.
But meanwhile the intervention in Czechoslovakia modified an article of the pact: "the political and social regime" Marxist-Leninist became obligatory and irreversible.
An observer from the People's Republic of China attended the meeting.
The members of the alliance promised each other mutual aid in case of aggression of one of the member countries.
Member countries are divided into two groups: creditor countries and indebted countries.
Attempts to abandon the pact by other countries were crushed by force on several occasions.
These facts brought to light a new policy pursued by the USSR concerning the pact.
The GDR officially withdrew from the Pact on 30 September 1990, 3 days before German reunification.
When it appeared that the USSR would no longer use force to impose its policy, a series of rapid political changes ensued.
The Soviet army is by far the most powerful of the Pact's forces.
We proved that the integration forces were more powerful than the fragmentation forces.
And the defunct "Nationale Volksarmee" of the GDR was no longer part of the Pact.
These facts were very badly perceived by Moscow who saw a Western penetration in its "sphere of influence".
The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a mammal usually classified in the family Ursidae (Ursidae), native to central China.
The scientific name of the giant panda is "Ailuropoda melanoleuca", "melanoleuca" meaning "black-white".
Until 1901, the giant panda was known by English speakers as "parti-colored bear".
As with most large mammals, females are generally smaller and less massive.
His thick coat protects him from the cold of the high altitude regions where he lives.
The panda has six fingers, including a "fake thumb" opposable to his five fingers.
Phenomenon of evolutionary Convergence, it comes from the transformation of a modified wrist bone (the sesamoid bone).
His hearing and his sense of smell are very fine: he uses these two senses mainly to orient himself and to find his bearings.
His sight, on the other hand, is rather mediocre: less good than that of the cat or the man.
"The giant panda is confined to south-central China.
The giant panda is usually portrayed eating bamboo peacefully rather than hunting, which adds to its image of innocence.
Although classified as carnivores, this animal feeds mainly on plants.
Its carnivorous origin explains why it has a digestive system capable of digesting meat.
Its microbiota would be closer to that of its carnivorous or omnivorous counterparts than herbivores.
His thumb allows him to pick and hold the bamboo stems.
The shoots are swallowed whole, but it keeps only the heart and rejects the bark.
Many Chinese bamboo forests are today exploited by humans or have been cleared to become arable land.
This is one of the reasons for the sharp regression of the species, which no longer has its staple food.
Pandas reach sexual maturity between 5 ¬Ω and 6 years of age.
They can only breed a few days a year, making reproduction difficult.
The duration of gestation is about 112 to 163 days (137.5 days on average).
The mother can give birth to one or two small, rarely three, with an average of 1.7 per litter.
After about 46 weeks, the little one is completely weaned, and he can fend for himself at about 18 months.
Having a naturally low fertility, they also have great difficulty breeding in captivity.
The male, with his food at hand, gets into the habit of not making efforts, even to reproduce.
To save this endangered species, zoos and breeding centers often resort to artificial insemination.
The first successes of this technique were obtained at the Beijing Zoo in 1978.
In nature, the longevity of the animal is poorly known, but would be about fifteen years.
A female panda died in 2014 in a zoo in China after gastroenteric and respiratory symptoms.
The snow leopard can also be predatory, especially to juveniles.
Bamboo itself is a problem for the survival of giant pandas.
Sometimes, entire forests of bamboo disappear and the panda has nothing to eat.
The fragmentation of their habitat is particularly dangerous for pandas, as they have to adapt to the life cycles of bamboos.
Giant pandas are the subject of a large captive breeding program in China, and to a lesser extent in other countries.
To a lesser extent, other countries share this concern.
Fecundated by artificial insemination in February 2016, the female Hao Hao gave birth to a baby on June 2, 2016.
My own mother gave me birth at her home in a small village in the Korean countryside.

This new country was formed in the form of a federation with a constitutional monarchy-type regime.
Canada was then made up of four provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.

The United Canada was divided into two separate provinces that became Ontario and Quebec.
While the AANB granted nominal independence to Canada, the new country was not entirely sovereign vis-√†-vis the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the sovereign does not only run the state but also the church.

In the 1960s, politicians achieved a tour de force with the abolition of the Quebec Legislative Council.
This chamber acted on the Legislative Councils of Lower Canada and the United Province of Canada.
The lieutenant-governor of Quebec remains, however, still today, the symbol of the British monarchy in Quebec.
In addition, even today, some people do not recognize the legitimacy of Parliament and the federal government in French-Canadian affairs.
Not to mention that Quebec never signed the constitutional law of 1982.
These migrate to the United States, the provinces of Ontario and the Prairies.
The purpose of the latter was to get Quebec to ratify the Constitution.
In recent years, various splits have emerged within the sovereignist movement on the national question.
In this strategy, the independence of Quebec is seen as a question of fact while a referendum is an administrative formality.

In recent years, this practice has experienced some development, particularly in France.
In the last three years, Latin America has experienced an unprecedented economic explosion.
Supervised hikes are usually by volunteers, who are commonly called "staffeurs" (anglicism).
They are identifiable with their t-shirts or chasubles of bright color (canary yellow in Paris).
A motorized vehicle can also accompany the hike for better signage.
The most organized teams have a dedicated communication equipment (walkie-talkie) to maintain the cohesion of the procession.
First of all, you have to plan the route that will be done.
This forecast is usually done on a map, but can sometimes be done directly in the field.
A preliminary recognition makes it possible to verify that the difficulties encountered will not turn into danger during the passage of the procession.
It is also necessary to regularly check the works to be sure that the roads will not be cut.
The associations organizing the hikes must take out an insurance policy (Art.
R 331-10 Code du Sport), the so-called "civil liability organizer" which covers the pecuniary consequences of possible damages that may fall on them.
In addition, some contract a specific and non-compulsory insurance policy known as "bodily injury" for the benefit of participants.
Like other sports events, roller blading meets a specific legal framework.
Given the obligations of the associations vis-√†-vis the participants, the organization of hikes has a significant cost.
Ordinary expenses include insurance, rescue, security systems, broom cars ...
It is mainly used to judge the quality of obstetric and pediatric care in a country.
Reducing the infant mortality rate is part of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.
With few exceptions, infant mortality is much higher in developing countries than in developed countries.
It is also important that developing countries work to compensate for the consequences of globalization.

It is during his first week that the newborn baby is most at risk of dying.
Infant deaths are as numerous during this neonatal period as during the following 11 months.
In 2009, 3.7 out of every 1,000 newborns died before their first birthday.
This increase is poorly understood and the reasons are likely to be multiple and complex.
A prolific playwright, he wrote 124 plays, many of which were great hits.
Two will die in the cradle (the eldest in 1883, the youngest in 1887).
The youngest, Jean, born in 1884 in St. Petersburg, became an actor and journalist before perishing in a car accident in 1920.
He owes his baptismal name to his godfather Tsar Alexander III who appreciated the talent of Lucien Guitry.
Her parents separated in 1885, Ren√©e Delmas refusing the many connections of her husband, including Sarah Bernhardt.
"The Page" is created on April 15, 1902 and totals 35 performances.
Alphonse Allais, friend with his father Lucien, makes him enter the humorous magazine "Le Sourire".
Sacha made on this occasion the knowledge of Charlotte Lys√®s, a young prot√©g√© of his father.
Sacha moved with Charlotte Lys√®s and wrote for her her third play, "The KWTZ", premiered at the Capucine Theater in late 1905.
But it is with "Nono" eight months later at the theater of Mathurins that Guitry wins his first big success.
Charlotte and Sacha get married on August 14, 1907 in Honfleur.
With cinema, Guitry's reports are then rather complex.
He films, among others, friends of his father, Auguste Rodin, Claude Monet, Anatole France, Auguste Renoir.
He notes their words and repeats them during the public broadcasts, inventing in a way, and before the hour, the voice-over.
according to an original scenario and entrusts the female lead to Jacqueline Delubac.
In 1936, he turns from the play he wrote "The New Testament".
Then, again in 1936, he directed "The Romance of a Cheater", his masterpiece for many specialists.
From 1935 to 1937, Guitry made ten films, including at least three "masterpieces".
His name is proposed for the French Academy but Guitry refuses the condition imposed on him: to give up his acting activity.
In 1939, he was elected to the Academy Goncourt and realizes "They were nine bachelors".

", published in" L'Aurore "on January 13, 1898, Guitry writes:" Was not it audacious, even provoking?
In this period he was neither a good psychologist nor a sufficiently objective one.

Sacha Guitry plays the lead role in almost all his films.
A loyal friend of Pauline Carton, he plays it in all his films, sometimes inventing roles.
He also repeatedly asks Gaby Morlay for his plays and two of his films.
Throughout his work, Guitry is the singer of the comedian, his father in particular.
He dedicates two pieces to him "My father was right" (1919) and "The Comedian" (1921), both adapted to the cinema.
With criticism, Sacha Guitry has always maintained conflicting relationships, from his beginnings in the theater.
Guitry invents a style of his own, based on incisive and percussive dialogues, often declaimed by him.
His films are criticized as being "filmed theater".
Critics often blame Guitry for revealing the undercurrents.
The filmmaker, showing his style, affixes his claw and prevents anyone from copying it.
And the film gets down by criticism, despite positive reactions.
Among the most virulent critics, one regularly finds the accusation of pretension and megalomania.
From cinema, Guitry said: "It's a magic lantern.
"Casualness, elegance, finesse and humor allied to a solid technical mastery have enough to attract gossip and jealousy.
His wives, who have also sent him a lot of reproaches, also evoke this need for seduction.
Jacqueline Delubac writes: "To the woman, he refuses the logic of the mind, not that of sex!
Translation: it is not enough that the woman disposes, she must propose.
Dominique Desanti, in the biography she devoted to Sacha Guitry, remarks about "Do not listen, ladies!
According to Francis Huster, "it is often said that Guitry is misogynist; it's anything.
Maybe because he never knew how to hear them, even if he knew how to talk to them. "
Seduction certainly has more charm for him than everyday life for two.
Nevertheless, in the copy of the American version subtitled, the couple does not appear in the image.
Dacia is a Romanian car manufacturer, a subsidiary of the French Renault Group.
The vehicles produced are marketed under the Dacia brand in Europe and under the Renault brand in the rest of the world.
The company Dacia was founded in 1966 in Romania and produced mainly derivatives of the Renault car range.
In 2014, it represents nearly 30% of sales of vehicles in the diamond group.
In the 1960s, Romania made the decision to build its own cars for the Romanian population.
The choice is to buy a license, economically more interesting and technically easier to implement.
A call for tenders is launched, answered by Morris, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Ford and Peugeot.
The choice initially focused on Peugeot is called into question, because of the lack of professionalism of the commission.
New tests are taking place, and the choice is on the firm Morris; but negotiations fail.
In 1966, Alfa Romeo, Ford and Peugeot found themselves facing Renault, also entering the race.
Negotiations with Renault concern a prototype, the future R-12.
He is tested by the Romanians at BƒÉneasa airport, under the name of Utranel, anagram of Renault.
At the end of the period, the license is not renewed and it is the failure of the negotiations for that of the R18.
Thus, the Dacia 1300, become a car 100% Romanian, plunges into a period of technological immobility.
Ces voitures being reserved for the secrecy police (Securitate) et Aux aux D√®utes du r√©gime communiste, chaired by Nicolae Ceau≈üescu.
This participation increased to more than 73% at the end of June 2000.
The goal after the advent of the euro is to develop a modern vehicle at five thousand euros.
Since 2001, the Nova has undergone a remodeling, to become the SuperNova.
The Dacia SuperNova with old-fashioned lines was quickly outgrown in its own market.
Dacia proposed a new model at the beginning of 2003: the Dacia Solenza.
In the 1960s, the socialist countries of Eastern Europe began to want to develop their automobile industry or even create it.
But for that, they must appeal to large groups of the West, much more technologically advanced.
Terrorist groups are forced to use organized crime to finance themselves.
The 1300 represents more than 90% of the Dacia produced before the Logan
The first Logan was imported to France by a car agent near Dunkerque.
After five years of losses since its acquisition, Dacia generates a profit of fifty-seven million euros in 2005.
In 2010 comes the SUV Duster which takes the chassis of the Dacia Logan.
2012 is the year of the first minivan with the Lodgy, as well as the arrival of the first MPV, the Dokker.
Different versions like the RS Sandro or specific models like the Duster Oroch pickup are developed.
In France, an independent magazine called Daciattitude, dedicated entirely to the Dacia brand, was created in 2013.
Son of Fernando Pavarotti, a singer baker, and Adele Venturi, employee of a cigar factory, Luciano Pavarotti has a sister, Gabriella.
In recent years, the singer had to reckon with a health become more fragile.
The ceremony was presided over by Archbishop Benito Cocchi, who read a message from the pope.
The Bulgarian soprano Raina Kabaivanska, visibly moved, interpreted the "Ave Maria".
At the end of the office, Andrea Bocelli heard the Ave Verum Corpus.
His career in opera began concretely on April 29, 1961 with the role of Rodolfo in "La Boh√®me", in Emilia-Romagna.
From this triumph, Luciano Pavarotti began to make a name for himself all over Europe.
He made his debut in the United States in February 1965 with the "Great Miami Opera" alongside Joan Sutherland.
His first "Tonio" takes place at "Covent Garden" on June 2, 1966.
His fame broke out in the United States on February 17, 1972, with "The Daughter of the Regiment" at the "Metropolitan Opera" in New York.
The "maestro" manages to enchain with a disconcerting ease nine counter-ut of the air "Ah!
This interpretation earned him seventeen reminders, which is exceptional in the operatic world.
Pavarotti wins, along with this success, many "Grammy Awards" and gold records.
Thus, in 1982, he sings on extracts from "La Boh√®me" and "Un ballo in Maschera".
The third contest, in 1989, takes place on the tunes of "the Elisir of Amore" and "A ballo in maschera".
The winner of the fifth competition accompanies Pavarotti in a recital in Philadelphia in 1997.
However, Luciano Pavarotti's rise to fame is not without difficulties.
In 2002, Pavarotti separated from the one who was his "manager" for 36 years, Herbert Breslin.
His ability to read music and learn the roles, his personal conduct are questioned.
On this occasion, he sings one last time in Paris at the Palais Omnisports of Paris-Bercy.
Pavarotti gives his last series of operatic performances at the "Metropolitan Opera" with three evenings on March 6, 10 and 13, 2004.
The tour will be interrupted due to the health problems of the tenor and will never resume.
He is then very weakened because of serious health problems.
Remember that he died the following year in September 2007 from a cancer of the pancreas.
On July 7, 1990 Pavarotti joined the Spanish tenors Pl√°cido Domingo and Jos√© Carreras to form the Three Tenors.
Luciano Pavarotti devotes a large part of his time to charity concerts and humanitarian actions.
Times have changed, partly thanks to these people and actions taken.
He is thus credited with having been one of the first to succeed in popularizing opera among the general public.
This piece is often attributed, wrongly, to "Pavarotti and Friends".
When he tells this anecdote, he says that when he regained consciousness, he heard people chatting around his bed.
Then there were all his weight problems that frequently confused him.
He had to undergo knee and back surgery several times.
Also, for the anecdote, when Luciano Pavarotti went to hotels, he asked to repack the food he had not consumed.
When he was reminded of it, he called this reaction "usually poor".
The "master of the counter-ut" would never have been able to decipher music scores, although he could follow the orchestras.
Rider until he judged himself too big, he created a private equestrian school, the "Europa Club".
In 2000, he held his own role in the movie "Is there a cop to save humanity?"
The peak also has been added to other cultivated soils, such as tomato and eggplant.
It has since spread throughout most of North America as well as in the temperate zones of the Old World to the Far East.
The male is slightly smaller and slightly longer.
Only the examination of the last sternite on the ventral side can distinguish the sexes.
Males have a small depression, or dimple, absent in females.
The male sex can be confirmed by observation of sickle-shaped and strongly sclerotic edification.
Consisting of nine segments, the abdomen has a red-orange color in the first stage, which becomes darker thereafter.
The segments of the abdomen are laterally adorned with two rows of black spots, those of the upper row surrounding the stigmas.
We can indeed observe a depression on the ventral side of the seventh abdominal segment only in males.
In addition none of these species parasitize the potato.
It is associated with: "Leptinotarsa ‚Äã‚Äãdefects", "Leptinotarsa ‚Äã‚Äãjuncta", "Leptinotarsa ‚Äã‚Äãtexana", "Leptinotarsa ‚Äã‚Äãtumamoca", "Leptinotarsa ‚Äã‚Äãundecimlineata".
They usually need to accumulate 50 to 250 degree-days to emerge from the soil.
They immediately go to host plants to feed for a few days and regenerate their flying muscles.
Young larvae, very voracious, are born after 10 to 15 days and feed on the leaves.
In the absence of potatoes, the Colorado potato beetle can attack other cultivated solids (tomato, aubergine) or wild (black nightshade, bittersweet, datura).
The complete cycle, from the egg to the adult, usually takes a month to a month and a half.
Depending on the climate, there may be one to three generations per year, or four in the warmer regions.
The cycles being superimposed, one can find individuals at different stages simultaneously in the cultures.
The survival rate at the end of hibernation has been estimated at more than 60%.
These emissions are amplified in plants already attacked by insects.
In addition, the male CPB produces an aggregative pheromone, (S) 3,7-dimethyl-2-oxo-oct-6-ene-1,3-diol of semi-developed formula (CH) C = CHCHC (CH) OHC (= O) CHOH.
The interaction of this substance with volatile compounds emitted by plants enhances the attraction of the latter for beetles.
Adult Colorado potato beetles are very mobile and can move in many ways.
Some species of wild potatoes are refractory to the Colorado potato beetle.
These enemies belong to various animal groups: insects, arachnids, nematodes.
Some have been studied for use in biological control.
The entomopathogenic nematodes that parasitize the Colorado beetle belong to the order of "Rhabditida".
This fungus is itself parasitized by a mycoparasite fungus of the same class of "Sordariomycetes", "Syspastospora parasitica".
This establishes a tritrophic relationship between the beetle, the entomopathogenic fungus and the mycoparasite fungus.
"tenebrionis" is known to produce lethal toxins for the Colorado potato beetle.
In its original range, Mexico, the Colorado beetle habitat is deciduous deciduous forests.
It is also found in Central America, Cuba and Guatemala.
It is also absent from the Azores, Madeira, the Balearic Islands as well as Malta and Cyprus.
It was intercepted in Japan but is not established.
He settled in western China in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
It has also been reported in eastern China in Zhejiang Province.
The Colorado beetle belongs to the genus "Leptinotarsa" which includes 41 known species, including 31 in North America and 9 in the United States.
The quantity of leaves consumed by the larvae varies according to the larval stages and the ambient temperature.
The synthesis of these compounds is indeed a response of the plant to the stress following the aggression.
Many chemical insecticides are used to control Colorado potato beetles.
In the United States, the main insecticides used are imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, two products of the neonicotinoid family.
In the case of oxamyl, cases of resistance were even recorded in the first year of use.
Methods for determining the economic threshold of treatment have been established.
Early plantings (early crops) can destroy the tops earlier and thus remove a source of food for the new larvae.
However, these practices must be compatible with the rotation plan and with the market demand.
However, it is economically feasible only on reduced surfaces, gardening or gardening.
They can then be eliminated by treating with insecticide only the trap culture which is then destroyed.
This is a method that remains valid for small areas (gardens).
Different physical methods have been devised to control the proliferation of CPBs:
Biological control consists of using living organisms that are antagonists (predators, parasites, pathogens, etc.) of the one that we are trying to control.
The use of genetic engineering makes it possible to overcome these difficulties.
The Colorado potato beetle is considered a quarantine pest by the following regional pest control organizations:
Among the pests whose introduction and spread is prohibited in protected areas.
It was discovered in 1811 by Thomas Nuttall, an entomologist and British botanist, on an expedition on the Missouri River.
Its progression was slowed towards the north because of the cold winters, and towards the south by the hot summers.
He reached Quebec in 1876, Manitoba in 1879 and Florida in 1892.
The final invasion occurred in France in the Bordeaux region in 1922.
This substance, previously used as a paint dye, is mentioned as an insecticide for the first time around 1865.
Farmers in Illinois and Indiana experimented with it in powder form.
Paris green was the first chemical insecticide widely used.
In 1949, the Colorado potato beetle is the first example of resistance to DDT, resistance in the United States.
In the United States, for example, the manufacturing sector employs less than 10% of all workers.
Various postal administrations have issued postage stamps bearing the likeness of the Colorado potato beetle.
Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates and Mozambique also represented the Colorado potato beetle on stamps.
In Tintin's albums by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©, "Colorado beetle!
Is one of the many swear words proffered by Captain Haddock.
This expletive first appeared in "The Crab with Golden Claws" published in 1940.
This loan is due to the writer Harold Nicolson in an article of the magazine "Spectator" in August 1952.
The story features the quest of Cecil, a dark knight trying to save his king from the grip of the evil Golbez.
As the group progresses, the group tries to stop Golbez trying to annihilate the world.
The scenario is now considered a classic Japanese role-playing game.
"Final Fantasy IV" introduces several innovations that will become recurring in the series, and common in role-playing video games.
The game also benefits from a "remake" entirely in 3D on Nintendo DS, distributed in 2007 and 2008.
"Final Fantasy IV" is a role-playing video game (also known as "RPG").
In a fight, in addition to information (characters / HP / MP) is a bar that fills as and when.
The planet, simply called Blue Planet clearly refers to the Earth although it is never named directly.
The surface of the planet is constituted in a classical way, with continents, islands and archipelagos, sheltering deserts, meadows, forests and mountains.
Humans populating this world are grouped together in seven cities and a few castles.
The planet is also home to an underground world, totally cut off from the surface for centuries and inhabited by the dwarves.
This place, located in the bowels of the world, is bathed in lava.
The adventure also continues on the Moon, where the people of the Selenites reside, ancient magicians from another world.
The Moon has a very rugged surface and contains only a few caves except the Grand Palace of the Selenites.
With an extravagant appearance and comical behaviors, the Hummingway live in groups in a small cave.
The feudal system is in place and the rulers use aircraft and war machines.
"Final Fantasy IV" proposes to direct a total of twelve characters each having a different class.
Cecil will long lead a quest about her origins to find her lost family.
He ends up abandoning the evil arcana in favor of goodness and purity, becoming a paladin.
With her many spells of white magic, she will quickly become indispensable in the team.
Kain Highwind, Cecil's best friend since childhood, is a Dragon Knight "Commander" of the Dragon unit at Baron.
Here, it is obviously not to God that each of the two "brothers" wants to please, but to Rosa.
Engineer Cid Pollendina will also help C√©cil with a lot of useful mechanical inventions.
During the adventure, the group is completed by several characters who sometimes combine for a time only.
Rydia is a young "invoker" of Myst, survivor of the destruction of the village by the Red Wings.
Tellah is a wise man and a great wizard who joins the group to defeat Golbez.
Yang Fang Leiden, chief of the monks of Fabul joined the group after his kingdom was destroyed.
The young apprentice twins Palom and Porom help Cecil when he goes to the Mount of Torture.
Edge Geraldine is the presumptuous young prince of Eblana mastering ninja techniques, he falls in love with Rydia.
At the end of the adventure, the group is joined by Fusoya, the guardian of the Selenites, a very powerful magician.
He does not hesitate to attack neighboring countries to obtain magical crystals scattered throughout the world.
Threatening to attack the most powerful country in the world is like an act of madness.
In fact, it turns out to be controlled by Zemus, an evil Selenite.
C√©cil Harvey: Captain of the Red Wings of Baron, he is the friend of Kain and the younger brother of Golbez.
Kain Highwind: Commander of Baron's dragon knights, he is Cecil's friend.
He loves Rosa, but she loves Cecil to the great sadness of Kain.
Rosa Joanna Farrell: White Mage of Baron, Rosa is in love with Cecil.
During the adventure, she will be captured by Golbez, the older brother of Cecil.
She will return during the fight against Golbez and then stay until the end of the game.
Yang Fang Leiden: Grand master of the monks of Fabul, he will help Cecil during his journey.
He will die in the Tower of Babel, where he will sacrifice himself to save the dwarves.
Nevertheless, he will be "saved" by the Sylphs and will be able to come back.
He will also sacrifice himself by voluntarily turning into stone.
She will also sacrifice herself by voluntarily turning into stone.
Edge Geraldine: Prince of √âblana and ninja, he will arrive at the end of the game and fall under the charms of Rydia.
Golbez believes that Cecil is the cause of the death of his parents.
He decides to get rid of Baron's borders while Cecil is still a newborn.
Back to Baron, he questions his king about his motives and finds himself deposed for disobedience.
To find his place, he must perform a mission to the village of Mist.
In Mist, the king's mission turns out to be a trap that destroys the village.
This treachery pushes Cecil and Kain to rebel against Baron.
When he regains consciousness, Cecil finds himself alone and transports Rydia to the nearby village of Kaipo.
After rescuing Baron's assassins, Cecil makes a new friend in Rydia.
Rosa, meanwhile, fell ill while she was out looking for Cecil.
On the road to Damcyan, the group meets the great sage Tellah, looking for his daughter Anna.
They can only despair at the sight of the death of the inhabitants and Anna.
Mad with rage, Tellah alone leaves kill Golbez, the new leader of the Red Wings who led the attack.
Edward, Prince of Damcyan and Anna's lover joins the group to help Rosa and stop Baron.
On the way to Mount Hobs, they meet Yang who joins them to protect his homeland.
When Red Wings attack Fabul, the group discovers that Kain has become Golbez's right hand man.
He defeated and dueled against his old friend Cecil.
While Golbez kidnaps Rosa, Kain takes the third crystal and they run away.
To defeat Golbez, the elder of the village advises him to abandon the arcane arcannes to turn to goodness by becoming a paladin.
After defeating him, the group delivers Cid and flees with an aircraft.
But victims of the last trap of Cagnazzo, Palom and Porom sacrifice themselves in order to save the group.
To find Rosa, Kain asks Cecil to bring him the last crystal.
The group seizes it then brings it back to the tower of Zott where sits Golbez.
At the top, Tellah attacks him by throwing the weather at the cost of his life.
In this world of dwarves, Cecil helps King Giotto fight Golbez and protect the crystals.
As the group fights Golbez trying to steal a crystal, Rydia reappears, now much more powerful.
Back on the surface, Cid throws the ship with a bomb to close the passage in front of the Red Wings.
On the way to Golbez's lair, the group is joined by Edge, who sued Rubicante.
But on their arrival, Kain, again under the influence of Golbez, steals the last artifact.
In Mysidia, the prayers of the priests make it possible to reappear the old aircraft to help the adventurers.
Arrived on the Moon, the group meets FuSoYa.
For this, he controls Golbez to make him invoke a giant robot designed to destroy everything.
Back on the planet, the group and a coalition of the world's army are attacking the destructive robot.
FuSoYa manages to put an end to Zemus's hold on Golbez, and Cecil learns that he is his brother.
At the heart of the satellite, Golbez and FuSoYa manage to kill Zemus, but he resurrects in the form of the Zeromus spirit.
But this plan is quickly put aside, thanks to an immediate transition to the new 16-bit console.
Although they are better than its predecessors, these graphics are still pretty basic for the Super Nintendo.
The game is made by a team of twenty people, many of whom have already worked on previous episodes.
For the music of "Final Fantasy IV", Uematsu remembers a very difficult creative process.
In the end, however, the press talks about a good soundtrack, both on inspiration and on sound quality.
A last album, titled "Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections" is published in April 1992.
It contains several melodies arranged for the piano and performed by Toshiyuki Mori.
Editing an album dedicated entirely to the piano will become a constant in the series.
As for the first episode of the saga, Square decides to translate and edit the game in the United States.
Regarding the second opus released in this region, it is renamed "Final Fantasy II" and released on November 23, 1991.
To reach a broad American audience, Square modifies several components of the game to make it more accessible.
More generally, anything that could shock is removed, including Judeo-Christian references.
A month before this release, October 29, 1991 Square publishes a new simplified version of the game in Japan.
The game begins to be reissued in the late 1990s in Japan.
With the great popularity that has acquired the license in the archipelago, Square does not hesitate to highlight the old episodes of the series.
It will be criticized for the appearance of loading times at the beginning of the fighting, which were absent before.
This port will serve as the basis for all other versions of the game on PlayStation.
On the other hand no other translation into other European languages ‚Äã‚Äãis proposed.
It is distributed in a pack containing the game, the console and the hull.
Despite the complexity and maturity of the original script, the game is accessible to all audiences.
The graphics of the WonderSwan Color version are taken over and further improved.
Some passages of the original script that was not included as well as some possibilities are added.
It is made by Matrix Software who has just done a similar job on "Final Fantasy III" for the same console.
The game presents a very good graphic achievement for the DS.
But the new combat system is considered too slow by the critics.
The latest remake is known as the Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection.
On this slab are present Final Fantasy IV, his suite The Following Years and an Interlude connecting the two.
The game is optimized in 2D, with possibility to choose the original music.
Square Enix distributes the first chapter free of charge and charges the following ten, published at regular intervals.
The product is titled "" and begins to be published in June 2009.
The scenario involves the old heroes and new characters.
Foreigners may find themselves in an irregular situation ("undocumented") for several reasons:
However, US statistics include in this category people who have used false documents to cross the border.
By definition, it is difficult to know the number of illegal aliens present in the country.
According to the Commission of Inquiry into the regularization of foreigners in an irregular situation of the French Senate:
The question of foreigners in an irregular situation is the subject of many semantic manipulations.
The terms most commonly used to describe these migrants are those of "clandestine" and "illegal workers".
This term, however, remains highly criminalizing in the eyes of some defenders of illegal aliens.
State and legal authorities are paying much more attention to the question of illegality.
Thus the Swiss state agencies (IMES, ODR, ODM) speak of "illegal migrants".
The associative and migrant support movements prefer the more activist term "Sans-Papiers".
Indeed, in a very large majority, the "Sans-Papiers" have a valid passport.
Most developed countries today have a dual orientation policy:
Of course, this applies to both developed and developing countries.
But there is also the so-called category of "ni-ni", for "neither expulsion nor regularization".
This request gives rise to an instruction and a positive or negative decision after several steps.
The origins sometimes have a link with their destination countries.
In many developed countries, the subject of illegal aliens is controversial.
Even in many developed countries, coal still accounts for a large part of energy generation.
The views also conflict with the power that a state should have vis-√†-vis the residence of foreigners:
Because of these different points of view, parties or organizations advocate different policies:
That's why he did not form a political party that claims to be his.
By the beginning of 1917, the overwhelming majority of the Russian population wanted the end of the First World War.
This desire for peace is one of the immediate causes of the two Russian revolutions.
Indeed, the failure of the offensive launched in July 1917 completed the disruption of the army.
On November 30, the new Russian government announced its wish to prepare a peace without annexations or compensation.
Negotiations start only on December 15, with talks to which the Allies do not take part.
Indeed, in accordance with the clauses of the armistice, the peace negotiations must begin immediately after the armistice entered into force.
The negotiations leading to the treaty are conducted under the double pressure of the dual monarchy and the government of the Rada.
But Ukraine is not the only state with which the central powers treat.
The latter is trying to breathe new life into the negotiations, using peace as a propaganda tool.
The Bolsheviks are then forced by Lenin to accept the humiliating conditions imposed on them.
In February, the Finnish Provisional Government requests the assistance of the Reich in the conflict with the Finnish Bolsheviks.
Its ratification is submitted, on the Austrian side, by the deliveries to which the Government of Rada has committed itself.
Among the central powers, only the Ottoman Empire and the Danubian Monarchy have their borders redrawn for part of their length.
Indeed, the Ottoman Empire obtains the regions of Kars and Batoum.
Since the summer of 1917, Russia has been undergoing a process of territorial decomposition, amplified by the Bolshevik coup d'√©tat of November.
The end of the conflict in Eastern Europe also has consequences for the ongoing conflict.
Indeed, the clauses of the treaty with the known Ukraine, the double monarchy is the scene of political upheavals of great magnitude.
The effects of the major political and macroeconomic reforms of the post-Cold War period seem to have faded.
Thus, peace is quickly signed, completing the end of the war for the Central Powers on the Eastern Front
However, faced with the tenacity of the Allied troops, these offensives doomed to fail to prevail decision.
Thus, the German reinforcements arrive only late in France, because of the enormous distances and the necessary time of recovery.
His racist and occultist myths inspired Nazi mysticism and Nazi ideology.
Present in the literature, The name Thule refers to the myth of a population living in northern Europe.
The region is supposed to designate the region in which live the Hyperboreans, mythical people.
If people do not live only by words, they do not live by the sword alone.
However, quickly, the occultist imaginary propagated by society is quickly removed from the Nazi press.
Steiner was general secretary of the German section of the Theosophical Society, before the founding of the Thule society.
As some members of Thule society would also have been members of the Theosophical Society, amalgamation was easy.
Around 1923, Rudolf Hess returned to Munich and became one of the leaders of the Thule Order.
This is not the only future Nazi leader to be a member of society.
Literature has historically been the first form of artistic expression to use this secret society as an important protagonist.
In the novel "The Ritual of the Shadow", the current reminiscences of the Thule are staged against the Masonic lodges.
In a number of video games or movies, Thule is a major player in the plot.
Thus, in the video game, "", the Thule society is an important protagonist.
The cinema makes this society an important protagonist of a number of films.
Similarly, in the animated movie "", the Thule Guild opens the door to Shamballa.
Her father is a tailor and her family, an impoverished Huguenot family refugee in Mulhouse for religious reasons, has seven children.
He takes the opportunity to study mathematics, philosophy and astronomy.
He takes advantage of the count's library and learns mathematical research.
After a few trips, he settled in Augsburg in 1759 where he published "Photometria" (1760).
Having finally found financial security, protected by Frederick II, he multiplies the work until his early death at 49 years.
Johann-Heinrich Lambert played a pioneering role in symbolic logic.
Gilles Gaston Granger is of the opinion that it is "partially a failure".
The most recent edition of this book, obviously named after Aristotle's 'Organon', was published by the Akademie-Verlag in Berlin in 1990.
In "A System of Ratiocinative and Inductive Logic" John Stuart Mill expresses his admiration for Johann Heinrich Lambert.
His "Correspondance" will be published by the same Bernouilli in 1782 (we find in this volume his correspondence with Kant).
To this must also be added several reviews that Lambert published in various scholarly journals.
We now have a complete edition of Lambert's philosophical works ("Philosophische Schriften") by G. Olms in 10 volumes.
Lambert's project is to constitute a scientific philosophy in accordance with the mathematical ideal of Newtonian physics.
His early work focuses on the development of a "characteristica universalis" and the search for a criterion of truth in science.
For Lambert, "these four sciences are necessarily part of one and the same whole.
Currently, there is no comprehensive study of Lambert's philosophical work in French.
The logic that Lambert calls "Dianoiology" is the doctrine of the universal laws of thought.
It is they who determine the "form" of our knowledge, abstracting from matter.
It is through reasoning that we can move from one knowledge to another.
Concerning the linking of "problems" and "tasks", one must pay attention to the characterization of the elements given and sought.
Laws of thought only determine the "form" of knowledge but presuppose "matter" as a condition.
We must therefore make sure that what we start with is true, otherwise we are led from error to error.
The form of knowledge states a principle of truth (although negative): the principle of non-contradiction.
The formal activity of thinking (whereby a contradiction is possible) consists in combining and ordering concepts.
The elementary concepts ("Grundbegriffe") are absolutely simple concepts, which in themselves contain nothing contradictory.
A concept whose possibility is obvious is "thinkable" and this thinkability ("Denkbarkeit") constitutes the character of its possibility.
However, experience is never more than an opportunity ("Anlass") through which we become aware of elementary concepts.
A concept "a priori" has an empirical origin but its foundation must be sought in the fundamental laws of thought.
The sciences which are constituted independently of the experience starting from elementary concepts are sciences "a priori".
It is therefore necessary to determine the properties of the elementary concepts to identify them:
From there it is possible to identify among our concepts those who are elementary.
They can not be deduced systematically; they must be methodically researched in the knowledge "a posteriori".
Lambert indicates two methods: the logical analysis of concepts (the Wolffian way) and the (empirical) anatomy of ideas (the Lockean way).
In one case as in the other, it is not possible to count them "a priori".
This rhapsodic way of proceeding constitutes the weak point of Lambert's system.
For Lambert the Euclidean axiomatic constitutes the model of science "a priori".
Axioms and postulates must have in themselves the criterion of their possibility.
The positive criterion lies in the fact that they are thinkable in themselves; their negative criterion is the absence of contradiction.
The notion of identity requires a separate theory that is exposed in the fourth section of "Architectonics".
The number of possible combinations being unlimited, the extent of the realm of truth is potentially infinite.
imaginary numbers) but which can nevertheless be the subject of a symbolic treatment.
Western values ‚Äã‚Äãmay be under attack, but Western goods are welcome.
The "truth" is the universal coherence of all knowledge "a priori".
This is how the domain of "metaphysical" truth is constituted.
One may wonder how far the field of metaphysical truth extends.
The question is, in reality, how logical truth can turn into metaphysical truth.
Logical truth becomes metaphysical because it is thought by God and because its possibility to exist is grounded in God.
¬´Les v√©rit√©s sont le" principium cognoscendi "of the existence of God and God is" principium essendi "des v√©rit√©s.
But the possibility of existence is not existence itself, nor is metaphysical truth the actual reality ("Wirklichkeit").
The passage from the possibility of existing to real existence depends on an act of will which contains the reason for its effectiveness.
Inspired by the philosophy of Leibniz, Lambert admits an infinity of possible worlds; however, "only one" is "real".
According to this theory the real world should be known "a priori" from teleological considerations.
There are therefore three domains of truth (logical, metaphysical, moral) that relate to the same original principle.
Otto Baensch admits, however, that Lambert's theologico-metaphysical reflections suffer from great obscurity.
The outline of the ideal of pure knowledge is necessarily accompanied by the awareness of its limits.
It would indeed be necessary for teleology to be scientifically established.
It remains limited to the realm of metaphysical truth, that is, the possibilities of existence.
The American consultant Sherry R. Arnstein distinguished in 1969 eight levels of participation of citizens in projects concerning them.
Participation involves a variety of stages, ranging from information to evaluation to processes that involve consultation.
Participation can be more or less collaborative depending on the case.
Moreover, catastrophes - whether natural, economic or political - will continue to shake the communities of that time.
It is therefore from this crisis situation that participation as we know it today is born.
In this context, "The years 1960-1970 were initially those of a certain" spontaneity "of participation".
It must be said that science and expert knowledge kept, at that moment, still all their legitimacy and their primacy.
The authorities will then have to act, the goal being "to regain control of a growing movement of protest".
Unfortunately, these different forms of protest are not accompanied by real changes in the urban society of the time.
The dynamics of change in Arab societies are rarely accompanied by changes in the political system.
Political practices are therefore slowly changing in European countries.
In the 1980s, we are moving towards a formalization of these participation processes.
In 1998, the Aarhus Convention further strengthened the legislation on participation and its application.
In France, this principle is only included in major texts, particularly environmental ones, later in the 2000s.
The concept of participation thus appears in the West during a period of socio-political crisis.
It is in this context, of profound change, that the participation in the years 1960-1970 emerges.
The two notions will not be long in coming closer.
In this context, participation would be one of the components of the social component of sustainable development.
One of those struggles that was probably the most popular at the time was that of the Alma-gare in Roubaix in 1964.
In 1980, they created the first APU (public planning workshop) to study with the commune and the developer (SAEN) their new district.
From this movement will be born that of the public workshops of town planning notably with Creteil.
The environmental approach goes further by evoking the broader and also more vague notion of "governance".
Here are some historical milestones of the evolution of participation in France:
512-7 of the Environmental Code for non-compliance with the Environmental Charter).
This technology makes it possible to create real-time interactive and collaborative maps hosted by a server.
Thus, it gives citizens the opportunity to reclaim their experiences, locate them and share them.
"Ushahidi" now represents all the individuals involved in the smooth running of the platform.
Moreover, it seems that crowdmapping technology is linked to the issue of participation.

Parker and Stone have been developing the series for two short films, which they premiered in 1992 and 1995.
These are some of the first viral videos on the Internet, resulting in serial production.
Executive Director of the Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX), Brian Graden, sees the film in 1995.
Popular, the video is then widely distributed, both with the help of copies and the Internet.
The FOX refused to take the series, not wanting to broadcast a program including the character Mr. Hankey, a talkative dung.
Parker preferred that the show be broadcast by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would like to make it a children's show.
Scripts are not written before the beginning of each season.
The production of an episode starts every Thursday with writers seeking ideas with Parker and Stone.
The following episodes are produced through computer animation, giving a similar result to the original in much less time.
Characters and objects are made of basic geometric figures and primary colors.
Most children are the same size and shape, they are distinguished by their clothes and hair.
The characters are often in second dimension and from a single angle of view.
Occasionally, some public figures are represented with a real photo instead of the face.
Since season 5, the series is animated by Maya instead of PowerAnimator.
The episode "Planet Big Nibards" (season 12, 2008), which is a tribute to the movie Metal screaming, uses the technique of rotoscopy.
The series frequently features scenes in which the characters react to certain popular musicians.
Adam Berry, the composer of the original music, uses a synthesizer to simulate a small orchestra.
The DVDA group, of which Parker and Stone are members, accompany the song.
The music of the credits has been remixed three times, including a remix of Paul Robb.
Mary Kay Bergman is the voice of most female characters until her suicide on November 11, 1999.
Schneider leaves the series in season 7, in 2003.
Stewart and Marshall continue to be the voice of female characters since season 8.
Stewart is credited under the name of Gracie Lazar, while Schneider is sometimes under his stage name Blue Girl.
The voices of infants and kindergartens are doubled by the children of the production team.
Hayes agreed to double Chef as he appeared to be one of the ideal candidates alongside Lou Rawls and Barry White.
Many celebrities appear in the series, some even lending their voices to their characters.
The comedy duo Cheech & Chong double characters resembling them in the episode "Cherokee Hair Buffs" (season 4, 2000).
Malcolm McDowell appears in real-life footage as the narrator of the episode "Pip" (season 4, 2000).
Jennifer Aniston, Richard Belzer, Natasha Henstridge, Norman Lear and Peter Serafinowicz double characters not representing them.
In the first seasons, several famous celebrities lend their voices to the series.
As a joke, Parker and Stone offer minor roles to some, most of whom accept.
Season 15 is adapted in May 2013, and broadcast since early June 2013.
As for the adaptation of season 16, it ends in June 2013.
In July 2015, the dubbing of seasons 17 and 18 was finally ordered and the adaptation could begin.
The series is canceled after five episodes and the last eight episodes of the first season have never been broadcast.
The series features the adventures of four children, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick.
The series has many secondary characters, such as students, parents or residents of South Park.
Kyle is the only Jew in the group and his portrayal in this role is often treated satirically.
Stan is created by Parker while Kyle is created by Stone.
In the first five seasons, Kenny dies in almost every episode before returning to the next without real explanations.
He disappears from the series for the sixth season in 2002 to reappear in his last episode.
Since then Kenny's deaths have become rare.These deaths later became cult of television viewers.
Most children in the series use insults, often punctuated.
The first episodes were based on provocation and burlesque.
On July 8, 2015, Comedy Central renews the series for three more seasons, until 2019.
In November 2015, the series is in its nineteenth season and has 263 episodes aired in the United States.
Season 14 includes two episodes unpublished in France and not translated into French.
Canadians, for their part, can now watch the full original episodes on the Comedy Central site.
Since September 2009, episodes are again available in the UK.
The number of households receiving Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.
For the third season aired in 1999, the notes of the series begin to decline.
The first episode attracts 3.4 million homes, 5.5 million fewer than the second season.
The audience increases during the fourth season broadcast in 2000, with an average of 1.5 million households.
It continues to grow, with an average of three million viewers per episode between the fifth and the ninth season.
In France, the Game One channel, which broadcasts the series, has its highest audience ratings for each new broadcast.
The episodes "200" and "201" broadcast in 2010 are plunged into a polemic concerning the representation of the prophet of Islam, Mohammed.
The message is, however, interpreted as a threat by much of the media.
Until 1990, peace was largely maintained by the threat of mutual nuclear destruction.
In 1999, less than two years after the beginning of the series, a feature film is made.
The film, which is a musical, is directed by Parker, who co-wrote the script with Stone and Pam Brady.
In 2008, Parker, as a Cartman, answers a Proust questionnaire conducted by Julie Rovner of the NPR.
A few years later, a small group called South Park Digital Studios is created.
The publisher series TF1 Video + The movie publisher Warner Home Video

Immediately after the First World War, Italy launched a policy of oil and gas exploration on its territory.
In 1926 the company AGIP ("General Italian Petroleum Agency") is constituted in that order.
The research continues until 1939 and is interrupted with the Second World War.
("Some serious events, years later, will mean that the oil cartel of the time did not want this competitor").
The organization aims to provide energy to Italy, contributing to the industrial development of the country.
Developing countries no longer have to choose between energy production and sustainability.
Only 0.5 percent of the world's energy is provided by renewable energies.
ENI is installing the first remote controlled platform off the coast of Sicily on the Perla deposit.
Eni, which until then was a public company, wholly owned by the Italian state, will be privatized and become a public limited company.
Between 1995 and 1998, four public offers of sale (OPV) placed on the market about 63% of the capital.
Agip is expanding its international operations with new acquisitions in Algeria, China, Angola, the North Sea and Egypt.
The company signs important contracts with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola.
In the latter two countries, the agreements concern the development of deep-water activities.
Agip puts the Aquila well in production in the deep waters of the Otranto Canal.
The ENI SpA group incorporates Agip, which becomes the Exploration & Production Division.
ENI consolidates its position in prospecting and production activities by acquiring British Borneo and Lasmo.

This name is given late, with reference to the "Stratagems of the Warring States", a book covering this period.
The ancient texts relating to this period are marked by personalities of different types.
They were written or compiled in the pre-imperial period or under the first Chinese empires.
The second part of the book narrates the lives of eminent figures, some of whom are contemporaries of the Warring States.
It seems that each state had its own chronicle written, but the majority of them were not kept.
The same problem arises for the other written sources of the period, preserved by the later Chinese tradition.
However, progress is being made in understanding their genesis and the context of their writing through modern methods of critical analysis.
The rise of archeology in ancient China is therefore crucial for the knowledge of the Warring States.
Texts written on wood that are known for this period take on the appearance of tablets.
Bronze could also be engraved, rather for solemn texts that one wanted lasting and which are less numerous.
Ce sont les Wei, Zhao, Han, Qi, Yan, Chu et Qin.
These states have their own identities and are sometimes distinguished even by specific cultures.
However, the borders are very porous and many people and ideas cross them.
However, the older, more sinister regions still look at them with disdain.
This principality is divided into three states at the beginning of the period of the Warring States.
These remain great powers, especially because they remain linked and are often referred to as the "Three Jin".
The main one is Wei, around the bend of the Yellow River and the Fen Valley (present-day Shanxi and Henan).
The second kingdom from Jin's partition, Zhao, is located north of Wei (Shanxi and Hebei).
He is in contact with nomadic peoples and lives on the edge of the central zone.
It is located in the present provinces of Shanxi and Henan.
Small and less powerful than its neighbors, it survives by serving as a buffer zone between them.
Its capital Linzi is considered to be the largest city of the time.
On the periphery, powerful kingdoms have the opportunity to expand their territory despite the threatening presence of "barbarian" peoples.
Between the two, Zhongshan plays a certain political role and has cultural affinities with the other northern political entities.
It is still perceived as a backward realm at the beginning of the Warring States period.
As of that time, it is largely around him that the interstate political game is played out.
This is the seventh great kingdom, Chu, first centered on the middle course of the Yangtze.
It then extends northward around the basins of the Huai and Han rivers.
These are sparsely populated areas with many uncultivated areas.
Although powerful, Chu is a poorly controlled, even unstable kingdom compared to others.
But its preeminence is not respected and China is divided between several rival principalities.
After 771, the role of the ruler Zhou is only symbolic in the face of political entities.
The period of the Warring States sees this process of political concentration strengthen, until the final unification by the kingdom of Qin.
It is marked by the rivalry between seven great kingdoms consecrated by tradition despite their unequal political role.
We can distinguish several phases during the political history of this period:
The essential source for the political history of this period is Sima Qian's "Shiji".
The author had access to many official sources because of his position as an annalist.
The information it provides is therefore generally reliable, despite the novelistic nature of the text, exaggerations and moralizing aims.
The partition of Jin into three political entities is then effective and is formalized in 403 by the ruler Zhou.
In the peripheries, several kingdoms assert themselves and reorganize while those in the center are in turmoil.
To the south, the conflicts between Chu, Wu and Yue cease after the conquest of the second by the third in 473.
Subsequently, Yue, Chu, Qin and Qi are experiencing a phase of territorial expansion after the annexation of several small principalities.
Qi, Chu and Qin are paying for these offensives, as well as Zhongshan.
Among the descendants of Jin, it is Wei who affirms his military superiority, after the victories of his great general Wu Qi.
After 366, it is Qin's turn to reaffirm his power.
In the course of this century, the number of military personnel is increasing considerably and the role of ministers and diplomats is increasing.
It is then that the characteristic features of the period of the Warring States are affirmed.
Qin, who until then played a weak military role in the Central Plain, increases his power.
His generals, including Bai Qi, but also Shang Yang in person, won several victories against Wei.
The king of the latter is imposed Bai Qi as minister and is under the tutelage of Qin.
Henceforth, the political game is dominated by Qi and Qin, with a clearer advantage for the second.
Meanwhile, Chu annexed Yue in 334, extending his territory to the sea to the east.
The conflict with the latter eventually broke out and Qi and his allies won several victories.
Subsequently, they also impose against Chu and Yan.
But in 294 Tian Wen is expelled from Qi and the alliance breaks.
The vanquished is forced to reorganize its territory around its eastern part.
It is on these bases that the first Chinese Empire is built.
His reign is essentially known by what the historian Sima Qian reports in his "Shiji".
In 230, the weakest of the adversaries, Han, is the first to be annexed, without battles.
In 228, Zhao was defeated in turn after the difficult siege of his capital Handan, which was followed by a massacre.
However, a member of the Zao Dynasty flees to the north from where he tries to restore the kingdom.
The following year, Qin's army eliminated the last resistance fighters from the north to Zhao and Yan.
In 221, Qi surrendered when Qin led his troops there.
The warlike dynamics of the Warring States period led the major states to strengthen their authority.
This period sees a "state revolution".
Nevertheless, discoveries of legal and administrative texts in tombs for half a century have made it possible to better understand administrative practices.
Eventually, several principalities see new lineages gain power by overthrowing the ruling dynasty.
These developments prepare the emergence of the imperial ideology of Qin and Han.
This is accompanied on the symbolic level of a change in the titulature of the heads of kingdoms.
This term, which gives the earthly ruler a divine dimension, is taken up by the first Qin emperor.
The symbolic capital of the Zhou kings gradually fades, a prelude to their political death.
The schools of thought of the period are linked to these changes.
In this perspective, the monarch has more a symbolic and moral function.
These reflections nourish the political thought of the great reforming ministers who also participate in the affirmation of royal authority.
He makes sure that all power is concentrated in the hands of the sovereign.
The scale of the constructions evoked in the texts is confirmed by the excavations of capitals and surroundings.
It could correspond to the Jique palace built in the time of Shang Yang and described by Sima Qian.
Such sets could be built on artificial terraces and hills to further elevate the deceased ruler.
The rulers rely on a new group of servants very different from the political elites of the previous periods, which they supplant.
It is among them that the principal servants of the sovereign are now recruited.
It is a group of knowledge specialists or weapons, thus able to assume the tasks assigned to them.
Political writings are also associated with the name of a prestigious minister without anyone knowing if he actually wrote them.
This period is characterized by great instability of the political staff.
we understand the context of bitter struggles to win the favors of the monarchs who settled at this time.
They reveal the scrupulousness of the courtiers, who are pleased to oppose them to the more noble remarks of the moralists, who are rarely listened to.
Whatever their origin, the king's close advisers take advantage of their status to amass considerable wealth.
They can constitute real courtyards around them, attracting little literary gentlemen who become their clients and servants.
The prestige of a minister is measured by the size and quality of his clientele.
The implementation of these reforms has varied fortunes but they contribute to a major reorganization of institutions and society.
The reforms from Shang Yang to Qin have the effect of extending the district model to older territories.
This unit is gradually becoming China's basic constituency, which it still is today.
The districts are grouped into larger units, the "commanderies" ("jun").
This creates a bureaucratic apparatus at the service of the state, more and more elaborate and controlled by the central government.
These guiding principles are aligned with those of military units formed on the same local base.
A final set of modifications reveals how much the state authority is consolidating.
Li Kui's legislative efforts at Wei and Shang Yang at Qin seem to have gone in that direction.
A major technical change in arming the Warring States is the crossbow.
Larger crossbows are mounted on wheels for the seats.
Their galloping archery technique, their tunic and their trousers are also adopted.
They are at the origin of the first Great Wall Frontier erected under the Qin Empire.
A bonus incentive recruitment or tax exemption system appears to have been used first.
To these different evolutions corresponds a profound upheaval of warlike values.
Now, the fighting involves more armies, based on the foot soldier.
Violence builds up, because the goal is the destruction of the adversary.
Many military treaties were drafted during this period.
The most famous nowadays is "The Art of War" by Sun Zi.
But others have survived, like that of Sun Bin found in a grave in 1972.
The goal is efficiency and the longest developments concern the preparation of the fights rather than their unfolding.
Military laws and texts on how to administer the army and organize its discipline also exist.
The upheavals that the military practices undergo accompany the evolutions of the societies of the Warring States at this period.
Economic issues become more important to them.
Part of these developments is undoubtedly linked to the growing role of war and state centralization.
The main speculative crop seems to be the mulberry tree in silkworm farming.
Agriculture is growing under the influence of several factors in which state leaders have played an incentive role.
Others have been won by drainage and drying of wetlands.
Then, several major water projects allow to extend irrigated perimeters.
This agricultural boom is accompanied by a disruption of rural society, which is also heavily influenced by the will of governments.
The most prosperous regions become large areas of continuous culture with an increasingly dense population.
Indeed, the thinkers of this period believe that agricultural production is the only creator of wealth.
It is therefore on the peasants that is supposed to rest the economic and military power of the Chinese kingdoms.
But whether economic power wins out over military power or not depends on the context.
Its economic and military rise encourages the Chinese government to pursue a stronger foreign policy.
The great servants of the state dominate the rural world, benefiting from the concession of revenues from large estates.
Artisanal activities are gradually emerging from the traditional frameworks of the economy run by palaces of kings and noble houses.
Then develops a very diversified private craft industry that benefits from the rise of big cities and exchanges.
The most specialized or famous craftsmen are the object of the covetous kings who seek to attract them to their workshops.
Some of the palace craftsmen are slaves, often prisoners of war.
Since war is often part of diplomacy, diplomacy can sometimes be part of the war.
It evolves a lot with the last phase of the Spring and Autumn period.
The metallurgical activity is at the origin of the wealth of several families of great entrepreneurs.
This is due to the development of agriculture and handicrafts as well as population growth.
These reflections feed on debates on state intervention in economic activities, notably through taxation.
Different means of payment were used since the previous period, some developing under the Warring States.
The issuing authorities were not necessarily states, which then had no monopoly on minting the currency.
Often the currencies seem to be issued by cities, probably the merchants within them.
Four types of metal objects (bronze or iron) serve as currency, spread over overlapping geographic areas.
In Qi, Yan and Zhao (hence to the northeast) circulate the "dao", in the shape of a knife.
They benefit from this growth because of their political status and the will of the heads of state.
Its organization is poorly known because the excavations were primarily focused on places of power.
Some residential, commercial and artisanal areas have nevertheless been uncovered.
The Warring States period sees the flourishing of many currents of thought, in the context of intellectual expansion that characterizes it.
Several currents develop which occupy a decisive place in the history of Chinese thought, their writings being founders.
Other currents remain without posterity despite some success at birth.
The relationship of these scholars to political power is therefore essential.
The famous Four Lords of the Warring States thus maintain a court of scholars.
From these teachings, a "school" ("jia") could be formed.
The thinking of the Warring States develops during the upheavals that live the Chinese kingdoms.
Legism is more present in the three Jin and Qin where it becomes the official political thought of the kingdom.
This regional rooting, however, does not prevent ideas from circulating between the different kingdoms.
He has never written a book that would have synthesized his thought, even if he happens to have reworked many of the "classical" works.
It was his disciples who were responsible for shaping his teaching, especially in the "Lunyu" ("Confucius Interviews").
Integrated into the canonical texts, they contribute to the pre-eminence of this current of thought in the Chinese world.
Mozi thinks that Heaven constantly watches over humans, sends demons to chastise them if they do wrong.
This current, important during the Warring States, however has no posterity.
The "School of Laws", or Legism, represents the current of thinking most practically and theoretically oriented towards political reflection.
Although government policies are ineffective, according to this school of thought, it does not matter.
This succession of poems makes "dao" a cosmic principle superior to the origin of the universe and to which all things return.
He advocates "non-action" ("wuwei") as the best way to govern society by avoiding upsetting "dao".
They also rely on the traditional divination that is reinterpreted, above all that of the "Book of mutations" ("Yijing").
Some of these reflections are later found in religious Taoism.
It is more widely a diversification of the uses of writing that occurs, which is also found in the literature.
The political aims of the theoretical works are indeed underlying a good part of the literary production.
It seems that each major court has had its own annals, but the vast majority of these have disappeared.
Those of Qin were taken back to provide the basis of Sima Qian's "Historical Memories" ("Shiji") under the Han.
These are texts that report in brief terms the events year by year in chronological order.
Poetry is illustrated by a masterpiece, which remains a classic of Chinese literature, the "Elegies of Chu" ("Chuci").
The "Nine Songs" ("Jiu Ge") depict the original religious practices of Chu, tinged with shamanism.
The strictly literary texts collect an oral literature, most of which is irremediably lost.
They are not numerous but testify to the development of several major literary genres of the later periods.
The religious fact in ancient China revolves around the relationship between humans and the spirit world ("shen").
So it is not so much the composition of the spirit world as its organization that is undergoing great changes.
It is therefore an energy that animates the different parts of living beings and links them to the rest of the cosmos.
They take different forms: sacrifices often accompanied by music and songs, exorcisms.
They are best known for the Chu where they seem to have been of great importance.
These practices are very harshly criticized by the currents of thought that dominate the Warring States period.
However, we can assume that they reflect a popular religion that does not share the concerns of literate elites.
It is indeed advisable to order one's time, so as not to upset the smooth running of the universe.
The traditional form of divination inherited from early dynasties is the divination by turtle scales, cheliomancy.
It is also necessary to expose a layer of tortoise to a flamme causing cracks in their ecailles.
The forms of these were then interpreted in order to answer a question previously asked to the spirits.
The sixty-four fundamental hexagrams which are then gradually elaborated represent the essential changes of the cosmos.
The latter tends to become the specialist par excellence of medical science that is constituted under the Warring States.
The remedies of this period combine exorcisms and magic, potions and other pharmacopoeias.
Its poor circulation would be the cause of the diseases and the art of healing therefore consists in acting on it.
In the imperial era, this physiological conception of the disease led to the development of acupuncture, not attested under the Warring States.
One may have the feeling that they are similar to those of the imperial era, which are well known.
Not caring for the souls of the dead ran the risk of being haunted by their ghosts.
Many cemeteries of local communities have been excavated.
As a result, the study of the burials of this period relies heavily on data related to this kingdom.
The tombs of the poorest, on the contrary, are small, with a single compartment, with little or no offerings and sometimes no coffin.
The richest tombs formed a complex sometimes complex and richly endowed.
Since its discovery in 1977, it has provided invaluable information on this period.
Subsequently, the rich tombs of the country of Chu take this model of residence "post-mortem", including sometimes up to nine compartments.
The dead of the middle of the elites were placed in coffins, painted lacquer for the most powerful.
The objects placed in the tombs to accompany them to the afterlife could be very diverse.
In some cases, bronze vases of inferior quality to those serving the living are made.
But in many elite tombs the "mingqi" are very elaborate.
They are made of wood in the tombs of Chu and clay in those of the North.
In the southern regions, there is also a tradition of hybrid wood carvings.
Linked to this mutation, the technique of incrustation on metals is growing in popularity.
Still in the field of metallurgy, the technique of lost wax is also used, but rarely.
The Warring States period saw the decline of the bronze ritual vases so common during previous centuries.
They seem then more and more destined for secular needs, even if some are still used for rituals.
The incrustations are made separately and then fixed in the mold in which the vase is melted.
Artists performing these sets may be inspired by patterns made to decorate fabrics.
Other bronze pieces serve as supports, including screen stands or lamp holders.
Hook-shaped objects with an ornamental function are other examples of bronze creations characteristic of this period.
They could be worn on clothes or used to hang personal belongings inside the houses.
Jade remains a material used to make beautiful objects prized by the elite.
They emphasize the prestige of their owner and are valuable presents exchanged by elites, including kings.
Lacquers are becoming more and more popular during the period.
The scenes where animals or human beings appear are of a more accomplished bill.
It was possible to differentiate several types of fabrics according to the spacing of the threads.
Their meaning is debated, but it is likely that it has a relationship with the fate of the deceased in the afterlife.
The central chamber of the tomb of Marquis Yi from Zeng to Leigudun included a real orchestra of 124 instruments.
Music has an important role in many rituals of royal and princely courts, rituals accompanied by dances.
"Classic" books deal with this: the "Book of Music" ("Yuejing") and the "Book of Odes" ("Shijing").
As early as the 1960s, preferential employment was introduced.
It is therefore not surprising that foreigners or French nationals from minorities also have difficulties.
While some see it as an example of politically correct, the word "discrimination" still retains an extremely negative connotation.
Others believe that the term "affirmative action" should be used instead, a literal translation of the American expression "affirmative action".
The principles of social justice can lead to a reorientation of public services to the most needy.
It is therefore a question of better differentiating beneficiaries from the welfare state in order to allocate wealth appropriately.
Where these criteria refer to communities (ethnic, for example) or gender, positive discrimination is reluctant.
This is especially true in a country like France where such a policy runs counter to the republican tradition of equality of citizens.
However, the French "parity" laws are already part of a positive discrimination policy.
By reserving university enrollment quotas for a certain category of people, he is better educated.
Education is the basis for creating a better future and integration into society.
The creation of hiring quotas allows this category to create a place in the labor market.
It also helps to provide some visibility to these groups and can help to change mentalities.
Tax action is for the moment the preferred means by the French State.
The rational employer, who seeks to maximize profits, is encouraged to hire these categories.
In India, 24.5% of civil service positions, colleges and universities are reserved for the Untouchables.
This gave them political weight because of their numbers.
Discrimination in education devalues ‚Äã‚Äãthe degrees obtained, their prestige is no longer the same.
For Laine, "suspicion [about qualifications] is the odious corollary of affirmative action policies".
Positive discrimination requires higher institutions to recruit at a lower level in the population in difficulty.
Employee quotas do not prevent the continuation of discrimination within the company.
There are always companies that pay their employees differently depending on their gender or skin color.
Positive or negative tax incentives for certain activities have never proven true benefits proportionate to the sacrifice.
The tax incentive (eg free zone) can create opportunistic attitudes, harmful to the local population.
The populations are thus obliged to subsidize their own activity.
Tax discrimination can even have a negative impact contrary to the desired purpose.
For Sowell, "affirmative action" encourages ease and encourages people who are discriminated against to rely on these quotas.
Positive discrimination is accused of feeding communitarianism by characterizing people by their belonging to a category.
The diversity is greater, so learning is more rewarding for all students.
Activities that would otherwise be considered unprofitable are growing and others that are socially depreciated are declining.
The non-privileged can be denied places because they are not members of a group favored by these measures.
Taxes are more important because these measures require means.
Positive discrimination based on skin color will favor a rich black man and not a poor white man.
Which does not correspond to the logic of favor towards the popular classes.
Depending on the case, in particular the orientation of the moment of the various men and political parties, several main opinions emerge:
We know so well the parties and politicians that Polish political life becomes boring to death.
In the United States, "affirmative action" is mostly applied to hiring or enrolling in various education programs since the 1970s.
It was set up after a period of social unrest and racial riots.
In California and New York, immigrants, whether legal or illegal, are the beneficiaries of this policy.
Nevertheless, positive discrimination was questioned in the late 1970s.
Faced with these oppositions, some progressives argue for measures based on social criteria rather than on ethnic criteria.
Brazil has been practicing positive discrimination in higher education since 1995, thanks to the actions of then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took over and deepened this policy.
Positive discrimination for disabled workers has existed in France for several years.
The theme of positive discrimination was raised in the run-up to the 2007 presidential election by Nicolas Sarkozy.
In 2002, the Graduate School of Economic and Commercial Sciences launched the program "A great school, why not me?".
Since 2005, the high school Henri-IV reserves a preparatory class for graduate studies to high school students.
The parity law of 2000 requires political parties to propose 50% of female candidates.
The African National Congress (ANC- African National Congress) takes power in 1994.
The main measure adopted by the government is the Fair Employment Act.
The caste system, a typically Indian phenomenon, reflects an entrenched stratification and hierarchy.
Indeed, India is very attached to its culture, Hinduism and castes, considered inseparable.
Destroying the caste system would, for many, destroy India because the Hindu religion is a unifying link of the nation.
This country is populated by nearly 60% of Malaysian Muslims and Indian and Chinese minorities.
These measures are currently being challenged by some opposition parties in Malaysia.
They also have the particularity of favoring the majority of the population in relation to ethnic minorities, who are discriminated against.
The Algerians of New Caledonia are men from Algeria and, for a minority of them Tunisians and Moroccans.
They were deported to New Caledonia far from their homeland between 1864 and 1921.
More than 215 million people in the world live far from their homeland.
The majority of them were prisoners of common law sent to colonies to serve their sentences.
About 350 of them were deported political prisoners and others were relegated, that is to say, recidivists.
This revolt led to the deportation of all instigators of the uprising, including the Rezgui and Mokrani families.
They are finally sent to Fort Qu√©lern, via Marseille.
Those who had participated in the fighting of Souk Ahras are judged before the Assize Court of Annaba (B√¥ne) in January 1872.
Then, in January 1873, the fighting in what was to be called Lakhdaria ("Palestro") were judged in Algiers.
The largest number of deportees were transported between 1867 and 1895.
According to the list drawn up by Louis-Jos√© Barban√ßon, 1981 are of Algerian origin.
This shows that the convicts were not only the deportees of the insurrection of 1871 (which were about 200).
The Algerian deportees were excluded from the laws of 1870, 1872 and 1873 which allowed the deportees to be accompanied by their wives.
Thus, separated from their wives by force, some married communards and others married Kanaks.
Before their departure, all prisoners received a registration number.
They traveled 16,700 nautical miles or 30,928 kilometers.
The prisoners slept on retractable camp beds; they were sixty grouped in cages.
In total, 42 convoys with 2,166 men, about 60 died during the journey or on arrival.
Camp Brun housed repeat offenders or "transported" as dangerous.
The insurgents of 1882 members of the brotherhood Rahmania (insurrection called Ouled Sidi Sheikh) were condemned there.
They lodge in barracks and have a common room for prayers.
They gather in the fertile valleys of Boghen and Nessadiou also called "Arab Valley".
The first Algerian to benefit from a concession was Isa Khamenza.
In 1878, Atai led a major insurrection of the Kanaks who fight against the spoliation of their land.
With some forty Algerians under Boumezrag El Mokrani, they participated in the repression.
Caledoun is the transcript of how the ancient Arabs pronounced Caledonia with their accent.
It was not until 1895 that the amnesty was finally recognized and the compulsory residence lifted.
But the decision to return to Algeria depended on the opinion issued by the governor of Algeria.
Among the pardoned following the revolt of the Canaques, 18 will escape.
As for Mohamed Ben Belkassem escaped too, he will be released on July 8, 1888.
The most famous escape is that of Aziz Ben Sheikh Al Haddad in 1881.
Among these are the descendants of these Algerians exiled to the "New".
They use the term "Old Arabs" when talking about their ancestors.
The surnames and forenames were therefore reversed, it was a random spelling.
He has also been president of the Association of Arabs and Friends of the Arabs of New Caledonia.
We must also mention Christophe Sand, researcher specializing in New Caledonian archeology, and M√©lica Ouennoughi, doctor in historical anthropology.
In early 1986, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Algeria, invited a dozen Algerian descendants in Algeria.
In 2005, the Ministry of the Mujahideen (former liberation war veterans) organized another visit.
Others will follow, the most recent being in November 2011.
His figure may have come from the fabulous bestiary of the Persians and their Simorgh, through the griffin.
Its origin is evoked by the Latin poet Virgil in his "Eglogues".
Symbol of uncontrolled impulses, the hippogriff carries Astolphe to the moon.
The saga "Harry Potter" strongly popularized through the character of Buck.
"Hippogriffe", sometimes spelled "hippogryph" and "hippogryphe", comes from the Frenchization of the Italian "ippogrifo", name used by Ariosto in 1516.
The possible ancient origin of the hippogriff is not unanimous among recent specialists.
Artistic representations close to the hippogriff are however attested since antiquity.
Known as the "Hippogriff of Campo Santo", it was placed on the bell tower of the east.
She misses the tail, but we think she must be a snake.
The upper part of the body is covered with scales of fish and a large number of figures.
But himself without a party, he continues to be at the head of too many parties.
Considered an idol or talisman of the Arabs, the hippogriff of Campo Santo might have been an oracle function.
In the Gallo-Roman and Merovingian period, there are several representations of horse hybrids and raptors, but their meaning remains very obscure.
A Gallo-Greek piece combines a horse-bird with the swastika, symbol of the moving wheel.
The "Simorgh" is a gigantic winged creature that can effortlessly carry an elephant in its claws.
The myth of the hippogriff would thus have arrived in Europe through the Greeks.
The hippogriff itself is described (but not named) by Pliny the Elder, in his "Natural History".
Jorge Luis Borges also notes that "this description seems written as for a manual of fantastic zoology":
The hippogriff, whose function is to allow the tour of the world, leads him to the moon and then to earthly paradise.
The hippogriff sometimes has unpredictable reactions but it flies from one country to another, carrying its different riders.
The furious Roland, described as a major work inscribed in the continuity of the Carolingian cycle, gives rise to many interpretations.
Ariosto was most likely inspired by Greco-Roman texts to compose his work, although this is difficult to prove.
Several attempts at interpretations maintain that Ariosto would have plagiarized ancient works.
At the same time, an Italian novel invites the reader to ride a hippogriff to visit this country from the sky.
"The Solitaire" is a poem in prose of the symbolist Ephraim Mikhael, dated 1889, which tells the story of a man named Stellus.
His hooves are diamond and the flapping of his wings shakes the walls of the houses.
Stellus agrees to ride the beast and fly with it, we never see them again.
The hippogriff is a rather common imaginary heraldic figure on the English coat of arms.
In this case, it is used as a "medium" and not as a "piece of furniture".
It is also customary for the coat of arms to use animals, mythical or not, to support the shield they surround.
The coat of arms of this one can appeal to a considerable variety of mythical animals, sometimes very close.
The object inspires praiseworthy comments, particularly those of Gustave Planche in 1853:
One would find the traces of his greenhouses on a rock near the farmhouse Carol.
A hippogriff-like creature (and named as such) is mentioned by various witnesses around Lake George.
He quotes a certain Pietro Micheli who would have considered him more harmonious than the winged horse.
This link gives a more poetic dimension to the hippogriff, and links it to the power of the human imagination.
In some modern representations, the Hippogriff possesses the four feet of the horse, keeping the eagle only its head and wings.
In the comic book "Cloak and Fangs", one of the chimeras created by the Master of Arms is a hippogriff.
In the film "Digimon Frontier", HippoGryphomon is presented as the leader of Digimon "beasts".
The "Hippogriffe Company", specializing in equestrian falconry, performs shows and educational activities.
Various fantasy universes count the hippogriff in their bestiary, this is the case of the Xanth cycle.
Hippogriffs are considered "legal" magical creatures in the wizarding world.
The hippogriff is part of the bestiary of many role plays and video games.
On Super Nintendo, the game "Demon's Crest" presents "Hippogriff" as a winged "miniboss" among the easiest to conquer.
In "" on the Sony PlayStation, a hippogriff appears as boss.
The hippogriff is a great flying creature of the dummy "Dungeons and Dragons" role-playing game, similar to its legendary figure.
Particularly aggressive, he is omnivorous, highly voracious and does not hesitate to attack all humanoids for food.
When several hippogriffs attack, they plunge one after the other on the intruders not to let them respite.
You must have a special saddle to ride such a creature.
In the "Eberron" campaign, the hippogriff is the heraldic animal of the "Dragonmarked House Vadalis".
It is covered with feathers in the front and hairs in the back.
Sarcoidosis is manifested by the presence of inflammatory cell clusters called granulomas, with varying consequences depending on the affected organs.
There is currently no specific treatment and indications for starting treatment are rare.
In Caucasians, there is an equal frequency of occurrence in men and women.
The black population is more often affected with a predominance of women.
The forms of sarcoidosis in these populations are furthermore more serious.
In most cases, sarcoidosis affects the pulmonary interstitium and mediastinal lymph nodes.
However, the presence of antibodies targeting bacteria of the genus "Borrelia" is often found.
This suggests the possibility of being affected by Lyme disease, which results from tick bites.
According to this study more than a third of patients were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi borreliosis.
Borreliosis is difficult to diagnose (ELISA and Western Blot tests are unreliable) and has multiple faces.
The risk of contracting the disease appears to increase when exposed to insecticides or farm life.
One hypothesis involves cell-mediated immunity against an antigen, currently unknown, on a predisposed genetic background.
The chronology of sarcoidosis inflammation has been particularly well studied in the lungs.
It is characterized by immunological disorders, which explain its impact on the body.
There are three different phases that follow: lymphocyte and macrophage alveolitis, the granulomatous phase, and finally fibrosis (optional).
The immune system produces a very strong response to an unknown antigen, which results in:
Over time, granulomas lead to pulmonary fibrosis, the main pulmonary complication of sarcoidosis.
The lung damage is almost constant: there is a 90% chance that the lungs will be affected.
In 33% of people with lymph node inflammation.
The recognition of cutaneous lesions is important because the biopsy of the latter is easy and leads to the diagnosis.
The eye is affected in 10 to 25% of cases, with redness, blurred vision, itching.
These signs correspond to granulomatous uveitis, typically anterior and chronic.
Slit lamp examination shows retro-descending precipitates, adhesions (synechiae), nodules of the iris.
A conjunctivitis, an intermediate or posterior uveitis very exudative with presence of granuloma at the fundus can be associated with it.
An increase in blood calcium level (hypercalcemia) is present in only 5% of cases.
This impairment is described in less than one in ten cases.
A depressive syndrome can be seen in a little less than one in two cases.
Kidney failure, stone formation in the urine or inflammation of the nose and sinuses can occur.
The establishment of the diagnosis requires the collection of elements of several orders:
If sarcoidosis is diagnosed, various tests are performed to determine which organs are affected by the disease.
These examinations make it possible to detect lesions early and thus ensure appropriate medical follow-up.
Sarcoidosis is a disease that disappears in 50% of cases in less than three years.
L√∂fgren's syndrome in particular, heals alone in 90% of cases.
The mortality associated with the disease is between 0.5% and 5%.
Complications are possible, but very rare: cardiac involvement, meningitis, respiratory fibrosis, chronic respiratory insufficiency.
Apart from severe cases, no treatment is necessary (otherwise, corticosteroids are offered).
For this, we must distinguish between the two forms of the disease: asymptomatic and symptomatic.
In the first case, it is not necessary to follow any treatment.
Clinical and biological monitoring for six months would be more than enough.
Symptomatic forms require drug treatment especially in the forms of worse prognosis.
In only pulmonary forms, only symptomatic patients with significant radiological and functional abnormalities should be treated immediately.
The efficacy of corticosteroids is greater if the treatment is started before the appearance of irreversible lesions.
Other molecules have been tested: Pentoxifylline could reduce the need for corticosteroids.
Antioxidants have no demonstrated value in the management of sarcoidosis.
Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913) was the first to describe sarcoidosis in 1877.
The French dermatologist Ernest Henri Besnier (1831-1909) described in 1889 a symmetrical skin lesion of the extremities.
This is why these lesions have since been called Boeck sarcoidosis.
Schaumann refers to sarcoidosis as "lymphogranulomatosis benigna", to distinguish it from Hodgkin's lymphoma.
They often work together and have almost the same goals.
One of the main goals is information about sarcoidosis in people with the disease and their environment.
It is often very difficult for them to find information intended for the general public.
In large companies, it is often difficult to define the contribution of each individual.
Raising awareness in the political sphere, as well as health and social leaders, also plays a key role.
Many self-help organizations for sarcoidosis are active in promoting research on this pathology.
Members of the United States Congress sit on Capitol Hill, Washington.
But in the corridors of the United States Congress, hardly anyone paid attention.
However, the inefficiency of the federal government under these articles leads Congress to convene the 1787 Convention.
The US Congress is responsible for developing, discussing and voting on laws.
It also exercises power over the US federal budget, trade, and defense of the country.
He can finally initiate an impeachment procedure to indict the president; a senior official or judge.
Although Chief of the Armies, the President can not declare war without the approval of Congress.
A bill may come from one of the two chambers, high and low, of the United States Congress.
The bill is submitted to a commission and then to a subcommittee in each of the two Houses.
The commissions then hear different witnesses, it is at this level that the various pressure groups intervene officially.
Once the hearings are over, the commissions usually meet behind closed doors to define the text of the law.
The bill is then introduced in both Houses to be voted on.
Voting is by a relative majority (not absolute), only present members can vote.
For the law to be adopted, the same identical law must be accepted in each of the two Houses.
If this is not the case, the bill is submitted to a Conciliation Commission.
The proposals of this commission can only be accepted or rejected by the Chambers.
Once the text has been accepted by both Houses, it is submitted for the approval of the President of the United States.
Once the text is signed, it becomes officially a federal law.
There are parliamentary committees that have the power to investigate the acts of men in executive power.
These commissions are composed of members of the two main parties of the country.
They have significant financial means and can hear senior officials who testify under oath and in public.
It has exclusive jurisdiction in the perimeter of the Capitol but may also intervene throughout the United States.
Its officers have the power to investigate criminal acts like other federal police agencies.
His father, Alb√©ric Gbemani, cook for a colonial magistrate of Lisala, died when he was 8 years old.
He is actually raised by his grandfather and uncle.
At the age of 20, he enlisted in the Public Force in Luluabourg.
He obtained the certificate of secretary-accountant and was assigned to the staff at Leopoldville in 1953.
At the age of 25, he is married to 14-year-old Marie-Antoinette Gbiatibwa Yetene, with whom he will have eight children.
This coup d'√©tat will count a lot in the relations between the Belgians and Mobutu.
It sets up a temporary government, the College of Commissioners General.
In front of the cameras, Mobutu then accuses Lumumba of pro-Communist sympathy to attract the support of the United States.
Lumumba tries to flee to Stanleyville, but is caught on the way by the soldiers.
Mobutu has him put in prison, where he is mistreated and tortured.
Under the leadership of Pierre Mulele, Lumumba's rebels go to war against Mobutu.
They quickly occupy two-thirds of the Congo, but with the help of the United States, Mobutu succeeds in reconquering the whole territory.
Abroad, Belgium and the United States are the first to recognize the new president.
Although Zaire claims to apply "economic nationalism," its policy is in fact not anti-liberal.
Proponents of liberal economic policies often recall the success of South Asian economies and their rapid industrialization.
In 1991, the capitalist countries broke off their cooperation with the country.
That day, the people stopped cheering Mobutu, everyone was scared.
The corpses of the slaughtered students are thrown into mass graves and 12 students are sentenced to death.
One of his wishes is that the country recovers its deep culture, it is then the "Zairianization" (cultural decolonization).
This "cultural revolution" and the cult of personality are inspired by communist regimes.
Zaire is then considered as an example for all Africa.
Foreign investors rush to the natural resources of which Zaire is richly endowed.
Over time, the regime's methods and the disregard for human rights made it uncomfortable for democracies.
Democracy and human rights will no doubt lose their rank as a universal norm.
Public finances being suddenly bloodless, Mobutu launches Zaire in a policy of "Zairianization" of the economy.
Businesses thus became a good way to buy loyalty for a breathtaking lifestyle.
To destabilize Mobutu, Agostinho Neto will launch his famous katangese gendarmes in 1977 in Kolwezi.
It is during this operation that we will see the fragility of the Zairean army.
Mobutu himself will plot the battle plans, ignoring the advice of his more qualified officers.
It is the French, Belgian, Moroccan, Togolese and Ivorian interventions that will save Mobutu and repel "the gendarmes".
But it is the unexpected end of the cold war with the fall of the Berlin Wall that will complete the Mobutist regime.
", a book of interviews, as part of a very expensive communication campaign.
The national conference organized on the occasion becomes a real people's court denouncing the flagrant abuses of the Mobutist system.
His illness will further reinforce this sense of weakness, prompting his inner opponents and outside enemies to step up their actions.
In 1994, despite the power sharing with the Speaker of Parliament, the country sinks into crisis.
One of his daughters, Yaki, was married to Pierre Janssen, a Belgian citizen, from whom she is separated today.
The Federal Council decided on December 12, 2008 to extend the blocking of funds until February 28, 2009.
Finally, these frozen funds will have to be returned to his family members, according to a decision dated July 14, 2009.
Three-quarters of the Danube Delta is part of Tulcea County (the last quarter is Ukrainian).
Together, Romanians make up about 80% of the population of Jordan.
Together, these cities account for 11% of China's total population and 30% of its GDP.
The human presence in the Tulcea Jude≈£ is attested since Neolithic times.
The region is populated in ancient times by the Dacian tribes or Getes part of the Thracian ensemble.
These counters form a confederation and seek alliances to escape the Persian and Macedonian tutelage.
The Romans raise cities like Noviodunum or enlarge the Greek ports such as Aegyssos (current Tulcea).
The Tulcea County was formed when the Dobrogee was attached to Romania in 1878.
Between 1952 and 1975 the "jude≈£" ceased to exist, the communist regime having replaced the "jude≈£e" by larger regions.
The park has also been recognized as a biosphere reserve by Unesco since 1985.
The national park covers 93,500 hectares and includes 152 municipalities.
The stages of vegetation extend from the Meso-Mediterranean floor over all the south-west gorges to the subalpine level at Mount Loz√®re.
The whole is limited to the southeast by the famous fault of the Cevennes, which is no longer active today.
The climate of the Cevennes is Mediterranean and gradually mountainous depending on the altitude.
It is characterized by heavy rainfall at the equinoxes and a significant summer drought.
The watershed forms an approximate axis of southwesterly / northeasterly orientation.
The hydrographic network that runs through the park is characterized by its length, the density of tributaries and the heterogeneity of their distribution.
It is through individual subsidies to allow farmers to improve their farms by limiting their own investments.
The operations carried out are very diverse and their originality is linked to their great flexibility.
They can be compared to custom development mini-plans.
The positive impact of the park's agricultural policy since its creation is very sensitive.
The lambs of course and the oxen of Easter in particular, benefit today from this label "Authentic of the Park".
It is certainly in this area where today, the results of the park are the most spectacular.
Between 1980 and 1995, it doubled its tourist attendance every 6 years.
Since the year 2000, it can be estimated at nearly one million people per year.
The vultures are in complete freedom in the Cevennes National Park.
To reproduce, they willingly nest in the downstream gorge Jonte.
The principles on which the multifunctional forest management desired by the C√©vennes National Park must be based are the following:
These principles must be realized through the practice of multifunctional silviculture based on:
In some respects, multifunctional forestry is still experimental.
The territory of the C√©vennes National Park must therefore meet a multiplicity of objectives.
Numerous testimonies of the Camisards war in the Cevennes mark out the towns and villages of the national park.
A permanent exhibition is devoted to the memory of the Camisards at a place called Rouve Bas in the municipality of Saint-Andr√©-de-Lancize.
Near Anduze, the Desert Museum, perpetuates the history of the struggles of the region and French Protestantism.
The C√©vennes biosphere reserve was created in 1985.
Even before the creation of the national park, the opponents of this project wanted to make their voices heard.
The establishment of a national park would lead to the dispossession of local authorities of some of their power.
The party in power, the NCP (National Congress), will doubtless contest the outcome of the referendum.
An information brochure published by the study mission will provoke strong reactions among the inhabitants concerned by the park project.
About the population of the park, estimated at 450 inhabitants, is the subject of these comments in the brochure:
The C√©vennes National Park is managed by a public institution, under the supervision of the French Ministry of the Environment.
The C√©vennes National Park is twinned with two national parks:
It was after a visit to France by Quebec representatives that the twinning project began to organize itself.
Exchanges between parks take place regularly, between the staff of the two parks, between schools, etc.
These three capes are located on the north shore in front of the Baie-√âternit√© sector.
Voluntary natural reserve of Combe Chaude: located on the territory of Sum√®ne, 56 ha.
Present since 1992 in the Alps, the population of wolves is growing in France.
In 2012, the first ovine flocks by wolves were reported.
In the park were inventoried 2,656 plant species, including 35 protected and 21 endemic (unique in the world).
Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU) is the name of the joint venture initially responsible for the Galileo satellite positioning system.
It was created in July 2003 by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission for a period of four years.
In connection with ESA and the various national and European authorities, GJU is in charge of the development and deployment of Galileo.
GJU is thus the only interlocutor for the private and public sector for the Galileo system.
The private sector alone can not counter the risk of losing speed, and will not.
Debt has shifted not only from the private sector to the public sector but also between countries.
First, the private and public sector balance sheets of most emerging economies are relatively healthy.
In operational semantics, the meaning of a program is the sequence of states of the machine running the program.
In other words, a program is considered as the description of a state transition system.
In other words, peacemaking programs must be prioritized from a fiscal standpoint.
This function takes for example the state of the memory before execution, and results in the state after execution.
In this semantics, all the examples given above for the operational semantics are equivalent, but the program:
We are no longer interested in the precise state of memory as long as we know whether the property holds.
These three semantics, as the examples suggest, are not completely independent of each other, in fact:
These relations have been formalized by the theory of abstract interpretation.
This term is no longer used in the US administration since the Obama administration took office in 2009.
Terrorist organizations began to target the United States and its allies in the 1990s.
Shortly thereafter came the year 2000 terrorist plots targeting, among other things, Los Angeles International Airport.
The invasion first took place under the code name Operation Enduring Freedom, leading to the fall of the Taliban.
Thus, super power combined with "intimate" enemies, the United States is the main target (although often indirectly) of Islamist terrorists.
The United States feels at war, and the Bush administration decrees the national mobilization, followed by the American media.
The Bush administration said the war would cost $ 50 billion.
However, the mullahs' regime is Shia, and therefore not very friendly with the radical Sunnis who form Al-Qaida's troops.
Riyadh was indeed, at least on the surface, a loyal ally of Washington and a major player in oil.
But as the conflict in Iraq escalates, Afghanistan fails to stabilize.
In addition to Iraq, Washington focuses primarily on Syria and Iran.
The assassination of Hariri was, however, followed by a long period of tension, marked by a wave of assassinations.
As far as Iran is concerned, the issue of nuclear proliferation is at stake.
Nuclear security is an issue that concerns the whole world and requires action at the international level.
In the summer of 2005, especially after the accession to the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an ultra-conservative Iranian president, the situation worsened.
This force has been under the command of United States Africa Command since 2008.
The states of the Sahel and the Maghreb are confronted at various levels with terrorism.
A security plan allowing Sahel countries to benefit from military aid from the Algerian army.
As for Al-Mourabitoune, it has 300 men at the time of its creation.
In France, the Vigipirate plan including the reinforcement of soldiers to patrol the public places has been reinforced.
Summary of acts of terrorism and police and justice activities in the European Union
The 2009 Europol Annual Report on Terrorism ("European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report") states:
The United States is now pressuring its allies, particularly in the Middle East, to initiate democratic reforms.
This was long ago the case of Kuwait after its release in 1991.
Terrorist acts have appeared in Iraq as a result of the US intervention.
Other acts of terrorism linked directly to al-Qaeda have appeared in Saudi Arabia.
Many people and governments criticize this strategy as utopian.
After the invasion, and in the absence of evidence, the government gradually recognized that these allegations were inaccurate.
It rejects responsibility for this change of position on the unreliability of the information provided by the CIA.
According to critics, the chaos that followed the fall of the regime is essentially due to:
Police and military cooperation was increased, along with technical assistance and intelligence exchanges with India and Pakistan.
As early as 12 September NATO formally declared that the attacks were an attack on the nineteen countries of the alliance.
His representative Osama bin Laden was then protected, along with many fundamentalists, by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
A car carrying Chechen fighters is also intercepted by Georgians after killing the driver of the vehicle.
Georgians and Americans conduct extensive operations in the region, capturing several jihadists.
Economic and military aid to the Philippines was increased to fight more effectively against terrorist activity in the south of the archipelago.
The most important thing now is to provide massive economic and military aid to Georgia.
The United States has put in place a series of measures to deal with the terrorist threat.
Most other cases have not yet been tried by this date.
This program raised opposition from human rights groups, accusing it of racism.
Its first occupants were Taliban or supposed fighters as well as those suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda.
This place of detention has become one of the most criticized points of the "war on terror".
After seven years, the right of the detainees was still not clearly stated by the American courts.
The intelligence services are accused of having transferred to foreign countries prisoners suspected of terrorism.
Upon his arrival, President Barack Obama rejected the controversial term "war on terror".
In 2013, the Guant√°namo camp remained open following opposition from the US Congress to its closure.
Resolution 1624 in 2005 paves the way for the adoption of global counter-terrorism measures
Other states said their own actions were part of the war on terror.
When Bush declared war on terror, he used it to invade Iraq.
Beijing has cracked down on riots in Xinjiang's predominantly Muslim province.
Several Uygur separatist leaders were executed in the 1990s and early 2000s.
George W. Bush's war on terror strengthens the Russian government in the second Chechen war.
In declaring war on terrorism, Bush united the country behind him.
This investigation was presented by the media under the generic name of the "Chechen affair case".
Israel has long been engaged in a controversial military policy against the Hamas and Hezbollah movements.
It is especially in Europe that the concept of the war against terrorism is badly accepted by public opinion.
For the French academician Jean-Fran√ßois Revel, this is a war of a new kind:
Because terrorism is not an enemy, it is a method of combat.
The family moved to Gahunge, in the Toro district of Uganda.
Paul Kagame is a major and holds a senior position as deputy director of military intelligence services of the Ugandan army.
In 1989, he married in Kampala Jeannette Nyiramongi, whose family was a refugee in Burundi.
On 2 October 1990, Fred Rwigema was killed during the fighting.
The death of this emblematic leader is hidden for several days from RPF fighters.
Paul Kagame enters the international scene by taking the orders of the RPF he had created with Fred Rwigema.
For his part Paul Kagame says that Paul Dijoud warns him that if he did not stop fighting all his people would be massacred.
In 1994, following the attack against President Juvenal Habyarimana, the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda began.
Paul Kagame is then the architect of the "reconstruction" of Rwanda, completely destroyed and emptied by the genocide.
Many observers credit Paul Kagame with bringing the stability and economic growth of this devastated country.
Of course, economic growth has never been linear in any country.
Desperate for their economic growth, the two countries had to make a marriage of convenience.
His opponents view his regime as a repressive autocracy favoring the Tutsi minority at the cost of assassinations still unexplained.
In November 2015, Kagame voted a constitutional amendment that allowed him to run in the 2017 presidential election.
Paul Kagame is the only leader to have put an end to the Tutsi genocide.
This fight against ethnicity is one of the themes of the RPF and Paul Kagame, well before the 1994 genocide.
This fight against the ideology of ethnicity is enshrined in the new Constitution of 2003.
The search for a democracy rooted in African traditions must not necessarily be modeled on Western ideals.
Kagame sometimes intervenes directly in local conflicts to force officials to respect farmers.
In 1996-97, Kagame was accused of interfering in the internal affairs of Marshal Mobutu's Zaire and of violating national sovereignty.
In December 2008, a UN report accuses Rwanda of supporting Laurent Nkunda's Tutsi militia in the DRC.
These warrants are lifted by the Spanish Supreme Court on 24 September 2015.
General Kayumba Nyamwasa, former chief of staff of the Rwandan army also in exile, denounces a political assassination.
An investigation is opened in France concerning the attack against President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994.
In particular, the Spanish investigation names Kagame and the RPF as responsible for the attack of 6 April.
The first works were made in the desert landscapes of the American West in the late 1960s.
The most imposing works, made with construction equipment, are called "Earthworks" (literally "earthworks").
The work must be no longer a market value dedicated to an elite but a real experience related to the real world.
The real problem is that in the real world, nobody has perfect information.
It was engulfed by a sudden rise of waters in 1972.
Sketches, reports and videos are presented to the public and allow the artist to live and perform other works.
The history of land art began in October 1968 with the exhibition entitled "Earth Works" at the "Dwan Gallery" in New York.
This tradition has been perpetuated by many contemporary artists working directly in nature.
It was exhibitions in New York in the mid-1960s that dedicated the term.
Fouras is a commune located in the south-west of France in the department of Charente-Maritime (region of New-Aquitaine).
The game show "Fort Boyard" and his famous "Fouras father" participate in the notoriety of the city since 1990.
The town of Fouras is located in the center-west of the department of Charente-Maritime, in the region of Aquitaine, in the former province of Aunis.
It occupies a virtually central location on the coastal coast of Charente-Maritime.
The city is attached to the town of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Pr√©e, with which it shares several infrastructures, including the SNCF halt.
The Charente River serves as a natural boundary between the towns of Fouras in the north and Port-des-Barques in the south.
The city of Fouras is accessible from Rochefort or La Rochelle via RN 137.
This one is connected to the "road of the Ocean" or RD 937, which goes around the peninsula.
A secondary axis, the D 214, links Fouras to the Soumard business area, then to the neighboring town of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Pr√©e.
Until 1937, Fouras was connected to Paris-Montparnasse station, then to Paris-Austerlitz station.
The stop mainly hosts trains from the Poitou-Charentes TER network and the La Rochelle-Rochefort service by thermal railways.
Fouras is the only provider of the permanent maritime link with the island of Aix.
Five beaches of fine sand border the peninsula, totaling four kilometers on the 15,4 kilometers of coast that counts the commune.
Two winds coming from the ocean, the noro√Æt and the suro√Æt, blow on the coasts of the department.
If 1953 is considered the driest year, 2000 is on the contrary the rainiest.
The Charente-Maritime is the French department that was the hardest hit by the storm Martin of December 27, 1999.
Many damages were recorded on the territory of the municipality.
But it is more than certain that the site of Fouras has a sedentary occupation since the Gallo-Roman era.
The engineer Ferry is in charge of the works, including, besides consolidating the dungeon, the addition of redoubts and batteries.

The Emperor was carried to the whale-boat by sailor Baud, a native of Fouras.
The beaches are landscaped, villas are built still visible today.
The railway arrived in 1873 with the construction of a terminus station, causing a rise in tourist attendance.
The construction of the connection from Saint-Laurent-de-la-Pr√©e to Fouras was opened in the spring of 1884.
Fast trains connect the city to Paris in "only" seven-thirty.
Beach villas on the North Beach emerge by the sea.

In March 2015, the city became part of the new canton of Ch√¢telaillon-Plage.
After an uninterrupted decline in population between 1962 and 1990, the city's population is growing again.
Between 1990 and 1999, it increased from 597 inhabitants, then 189 inhabitants between 1999 and 2006.
As for foreigners, with 0.3%, they represent only a small part of the population of the commune
The economy of the town is mainly based on seaside tourism and oyster farming activities.
The city has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, the ZA du Soumard, located south of the town, and a supermarket.
When oyster culture was introduced in the commune, around 1925, the oysters were raised on the ground, flat.
In 1970, an epizootic decimated the oysters in place and a new variety, called "Japan" was introduced.
The latter is now grown in meshed plastic bags, placed on iron tables.
The city has a regional museum consisting mainly of local funds as well as a collection of Asian and African art objects.
Estimated at a few million dollars, it is the most expensive African art object in the world.
The collections have been installed since 1966 in Fort de Fouras dungeon.
In addition to the museum, classified "Museum of France", the fort is the setting for temporary exhibitions (paintings, plastic arts).
Throughout the year, many cultural events are organized (book fair, gastronomic fair, art galleries with temporary exhibitions).
This old castle was considerably overhauled over the centuries.
It rests on a vaulted crypt of warheads forming four bays, and is established on three levels.
It was taken over in 1480 by the architect "De Brosse", who helped to modernize it.
The dungeon was preserved and consolidated so that a platform with guns could be placed at the top.
This belt of fire was to gather fort Fort Fouras, Fort √ânet and Fort Boyard.
Classified as a historic monument in 1987, this monument, which has become the symbol of the city, is nowadays partially transformed into a museum.
It has been listed in the supplementary inventory of historical monuments since 1994.

The castle, still owned by the town, has become a place of reception.
This building, located in the heart of the seaside town, has a closed hall, rather austere, called the fish market.
The auction of Fouras, which finally closed in 1940, took place twice a day and was announced by the bell.
With the rise of tourism, a second covered market, was built in 1935 with an Art Deco style facade.
This renovation was inaugurated on September 5, 2012 in music (piano and cello) and with the participation of a large public.
In 1633, the lord of the place was Jean-Marc d'Ansays, notable and merchant of La Rochelle.
The lordship then passed to Jean d'Ansays of Treuil-Bussac, his son.
The castle, very sober, was one of the main properties of the family.
Leaning against the enclosure, the house is served by a straight staircase.
There are three mills at Fouras: the mill of Aubier, the mill of Esperance and the mill Soumard.
All three were restored and converted into a residential residence.
The current building is neo-Gothic, with some borrowing in the Romanesque style, especially in the upper part of the bell tower.
The church contains several ex-votos, including two models of ships established on each side of the main altar.

Sovereignism is a political doctrine supporting the preservation of the national sovereignty of a country in relation to supranational bodies.
No country is willing to surrender its political sovereignty to outside powers or electoral monitors.
In Canada, the main manifestation of sovereignty ideology lies in the province of Quebec.
Indeed, the Quebec sovereignty movement aims to make Quebec a sovereign state, independent of the Canadian federation.
Since 1973-74, the Parti Quebecois has been calling for a referendum in which the majority of Quebeckers would speak in favor of sovereignty.
Since other political groups like Europe of Nations and Freedoms claim this tendency.
Some movements are calling for a shift in sovereignty from the national level to the supra-national level, such as Newropeans.
Charles Maurras also gave in his time a definition of federalism, respecting peoples and identities.
It denounces in particular the economic policy led by the European Union, as contrary to the interests of industrial employment in France.

The escudo replaced the real after the revolution of October 5, 1910 which replaced the Portuguese monarchy.

This point of view appears in particular in the newspaper of the GP, "The Cause of the people".
The GP was led by Benny L√©vy (aka Pierre Victor) and Alain Geismar.
The Revolutionary Groups (GR) appeared in the proletarian Left in 1973.
Some activists continue the GP a few more years, evolving for example towards the autonomous movement.

The mayor is a judicial police officer in the territory of the commune he administers.
During the exercise of their functions on the territory of a commune, they are placed under the authority of the mayor of this commune ".
He also takes an oath before assuming office in the district or high court of his jurisdiction of attachment.

The "security" sector of the territorial public service includes three employment frameworks for municipal police officers:
They provide the functional and operational direction of the municipal police services.
The municipal police can be organized and structured in different ways.
A service is usually divided into "brigades" or "groups".
The "parking brigade", which deals with verbalization at paid parking, annoying or in blue zone, is a special case.
It is often made up of ASVP, civil servants or public officials who are competent to verbalize the majority of parking infractions.
These majorities often consist of complex coalitions of three or more parties that agree on a minimum program.
As a result, the French park is very heterogeneous and varies from one city to another.
We can find minivans, sedans, city cars, etc.
Some cities have the particularity to be equipped with motorcycles, others, mainly in mountain, of 4x4.
These methods make it possible to obtain a very strong assurance of the absence of bug in software (Evaluation Insurance Level, Safety Integrity Level).
They are used in the development of the most critical software.
Their improvement and the broadening of their practical fields of application are the motivation for many scientific research in computer science.
If the domains of formula_2 and formula_3 are large, this check can be very long.
And if the domains are infinite (for example the real ones), this verification can not be exhaustive.
In formal verification, symbolic values ‚Äã‚Äãare used and the rules governing formula_8 and formula_9 are applied.
Using these rules, we come to show that formula_1.
Different mathematical corpora have been used to elaborate formal reasoning on software.
This diversity of approach has generated "families" of formal methods.
These include ("The methods based on ..."):
There are gradations and possible mixes between these methods.
A model-checker can be applied to a model built using an automatic prover of theorems.
Formal methods can be used to give a specification of the system that one wishes to develop at the desired level of detail.
In developed countries, retail food methods need to be revised.
This formal description of the system can be used as a reference during development.
Today, various means make it possible to formalize the specification of the programs, one speaks then of semantics.
A specification can be used as a basis for proving properties on the system.
This guarantee is provided by a set of so-called "refinement" proofs.
Formal methods take all their interest when the proofs themselves are formally guaranteed.
We can distinguish two main categories of tools allowing the proof of properties on formal models:
A castle mound is a special type of earth fortification that has been widely disseminated in the Middle Ages.
It is composed of an important raising of reported land of circular form, the mound.
There are several forms of edification of these works, often mistakenly called "feudal motte", in all the regions of Europe.
Most of the time the mound was surrounded by a ditch, the summit being occupied by a strong palisade.
A wooden fort was set up there with a lookout tower similar to a dungeon.
The defense is organized locally around clods, quick to build, and using inexpensive materials available everywhere.
Gradually, a warrior elite is thus distinguished whose caste clump materializes authority.
It can also serve as a stately residence and promotes economic life.
The caste mound is therefore a major element in the structuring of feudalism in the medieval West.
The castes - as their name indicates - are now assimilated to castles despite the opinion of some non-archaeologists historians.
For these two uses, the castellologist Philippe Durand adds the symbolic aspect.
From a material point of view, the mound castle is characterized by two main elements: the motte and the poultry yard.
On the Bayeux Tapestry, a vignette shows peasants building the Hastings motte ("Hesteng ceastra").
At its feet, one often finds (but not always) the mark of the residential function of the fortified whole: the barnyard.
The barnyard contained the buildings necessary for the life of the castle.
For about forty years, aerial archeology has allowed archaeologists to work prospecting easily and efficiently.
In France, Roger Agache has developed this method in historical research.
Toponymic clues, survivals in place names of an extinct or concealed motte should not be neglected.
One of the great historiographical questions remains the dating of the precise moment of the appearance of the motte.
But the question arises as to what these fortresses looked like.
The question is whether the country can survive in its present form.
the opposite figure of the besieged Citadel "), the undermining or mining and the approach of the rolling belfries.
Contemporary documents give little information on the mounds.
An interesting remark is preserved in the "Book of Miracles of St. Bertin".
On the other hand, the Bayeux Tapestry also offers a testimony on the issue.
The document shows, among others, the seat of the Dinan mound.
"Castrum" and "castellum" are the terms that the texts generally mention to evoke the fortifications.
"Motta" seems to have designated before the year 1000 a simple clod of land.
Easy to build, they can be built by sustainable farmers, which corresponds to the economic possibilities of the emerging chatellenie.
There are many free men who choose to lay down their weapons for earthwork, which is more profitable.
The laboratores must entrust their security to the squire against the supply of his troops or his house.
It can impose taxes, tolls, chores, trivialities (imposed use of seigniorial equipment for payment: ovens, mills ...) raised by his sergeants.
With the weakening of royal and county authority, personal ambitions are revealed, generating greed and contestation.
The "wages" of Carolingian where was eclipsed for a new territorial spring: the territory of the castle ("districtus").
There is a real territorial reorganization that corresponds to the economic expansion of the time.
This territorial reorganization is intimately linked with the construction of the castle mounds that protect this economic network under construction.
The authorities tried, from the outset, to limit the inclination to build clods that could have harmed their interests.
The first function of the clearly identifiable castle mound is that of housing.
The Merovingian and Carolingian rulers possessed royal "villae" especially in the Carolingian kernel (Laon-Soissons-Compiegne).
The knight ("miles") resided, according to him, "rather in a big farm equipped with some elements of defense".
The motte, also seat of power, can play a military role.
Taiwan is also preparing to play a constructive role, if the Chinese metropolis does not prevent it.
It is a building that the lords are passed on over several generations by arranging it as much as necessary.
On the edge of the Canche, one can notice the importance of the little chivalry such as the family of Rollepot.
The power is also organized on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãattraction ("districtus") which varies according to the castles.
The stronger the lord of the fortress, the wider the districtus.
As everywhere else, the little lords try to arrogate to themselves new rights or to extend those which they possess.
The Vikings thus participate fully in the process of feudalization and the economic expansion that accompanies it.
This cash, which is reinjected into the economy, is a major catalyst for the ongoing economic transformation.
The global money supply increases all the more with the weakening of the central power, more and more bishops and princes are beating money.
He has increased the powers of the Central Committee he chairs.
The introduction of common law contributes to this development, because the producer must generate enough profits to be able to pay the tax.
In fact, in some regions, the clods play a pioneering role in the agrarian conquest of the saltus.
In Thi√©rache, it is "to the clearing of lands returned to the forest that is linked the first castral movement".
In Cinglais, a region south of Caen, the primitive castles had settled on the edge of forest complexes.
In all cases, the castration on the outskirts of the village is very common.
These bridges, villages and markets are built under the protection of a lord who is materialized by a motte.
We see many "castra" located on major roads, sources of considerable financial support for the lord of the place.
In 1973, the thesis of Pierre Toubert revolutionized for a long time the research on the castle of the year millet.
It was in the perfect continuity of regional studies encouraged since the 1940s by Marc Bloch.
Thus followed Andr√© D√©l√©age (Burgundy, 1941), Georges Duby (M√¢connais, 1953) and Gabriel Fournier (Basse-Auvergne, 1962).
The castle was therefore considered in a more regional than theoretical approach.
The word francis√© in "ench√¢tement" refers to the action of fortifying a building or a village.
On the other hand, she noticed that the "village boring" was not common, far from it.
In the middle of the fortified villages, Dominique Baudreu pointed out the presence of villages devoid of any fortification.
It is the castral phenomenon of the years 950-1050 that precipitated the association of cells with the fortified center.
The best example is the village of Castelnou whose toponymy "castellum novum" highlights this territorial reorganization of the year one thousand.
The incastellamento is more largely the result of a demographic, agrarian and societal phenomenon in germ since the beginning of the Carolingian time.
It is the schema of a policy and a territorial reorganization which touched the shores of the Mediterranean for several reasons:
This one does not contrast enough with the village below so that the village boring is possible.
Fortresses in wood, therefore more vulnerable, low construction sites: nothing is close to the "incastellamento".
One of the causes, apart from the topography, is the later start of economic activity in northern Europe.
As in the South, the villages of the North undergo at this time a reshuffling of their finage.
According to him, the territorial reorganization of the countryside could be envisaged thanks to the intervention of the lordship.
Sedentarization in the North was not exclusively linked to the castrale settlement but even more so to the church and its cemetery.
The motte-church relationship is decisive, so much so that some churches were built or rebuilt on the old castle mound.
The parish church appeared before the castle with a motte, perhaps since the Merovingian period.
Of course they are less effective in the face of large armies having time to organize a siege.
The authorities are therefore taking steps to better control clearing, which further increases prices.
Few sites have been registered or classified as Historic Monuments.
Elsewhere, plowing progressively erodes the micro-reliefs of the earthen ramparts, the ditches are filled by important inputs of materials.
In woodlands, modern forest work can be destructive.
Only legal protection or public awareness can prevent these threats.
The Australian Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the only living species in the family of dromaiids today.
It is also, by its size, the second largest bird in the world today behind the two ostriches.
He can travel a great distance at a good pace and if necessary run at 55 km / h.
The subspecies of Empress who lived in Tasmania ("D. diemenensis") quickly died out after the arrival of the first Europeans in 1788.
They are raised for meat, oil and feathers.
The binomial scientific name of the emu comes from Latin and means "runner of New Holland".
On the other hand, the etymology of its common name "emu" is not known with certainty.
According to the International Ornithological Congress, this species consists of the following subspecies (phylogenetic order):
In its distribution area, the only bird of comparable size is the helmeted casoar.
The emu has a compact body, powerful legs adapted to the race and rudimentary wings.
The bird can cover great distances, at a constant speed of 7 km / h.
This makes it possible to absorb most of the ambient heat without being transmitted to the underlying layers.
On very hot days, the emu gasps to regulate his temperature.
Emus can be seen in most parts of Australia, where they live in a wide variety of environments.
Their typical habitats are the open forest and the semi-arid plains of the interior.
In certain circumstances, they can reach the deserts or the outskirts of the cities.
The emu spends most of his time feeding himself.
In this activity as in the other facets of his life, the species is diurnal.
The emu can travel great distances to find areas of abundant food.
Emus live alone or in pairs, sometimes in groups of four to nine birds.
They are gregarious only when traveling or in places where food and water are plentiful.
Within a group, the links between individuals are loose and there is no social interaction.
Situations of antagonism are frequently solved by a threat parade.
They are very curious animals that often approach men.
Located in front of the trachea, it is about 30 cm in diameter when inflated.
Moving a lot, the emu probably participates in the dispersal of seeds which must contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity.
In summer, they eat large quantities of insects (grasshoppers, ladybugs, caterpillars, ants ...) as well as small vertebrates.
However, emus has a significant capacity of resistance to lack of water.
During the formation of pairs, the female begins to emit her characteristic snoring call, in order to attract a male.
Couples will be formed in December-January and stay together for five to six months.
But the states thus formed have by and large never found cohesion as a nation.
Mating and laying occur from February to July, but mostly from April to June.
The first observation of true (genetically identical) twins in birds was made in the emu.
As with cassowaries and rheas, the male alone broods and cares for young people.
In a favorable year, a female can thus have three broods.
During the entire incubation period, the male does not eat, drink or defecate.
He gets up several times a day to turn the eggs over.
Once the spawning is complete, the male aggressively repels the female.
The eggs hatch after eight weeks of incubation and the male stops hatching just before hatching.
From birth, the young are active and, after a few days, the chicks abandon the nest.
The male cares for them until they are about 18 months old, protecting them and teaching them how to feed themselves.
Chicks grow up quickly and reach adult size around twelve to fourteen months of age.
The pups will stay together for another six months until they are of childbearing age.
Chicks reach sexual maturity at two or three years of age.
When circumstances permit, emus can be totally sedentary.
Otherwise, they are nomadic and can cover long distances in search of water and food.
Adults can travel 15 to 25 km per day and 540 km in 9 months.
They usually move in small groups including birds of all ages.
However, true hunting only began when birds came into conflict with economic interests.
In the face of failed destruction campaigns, the government finally settled on a reward system that had been in place since 1923.
Commercial upland farming started in Western Australia in 1987 and the first slaughterhouse was able to operate in 1990.
In Canada, the largest emu farm is the Charlevoix Emu Center, with more than 400 emus.
They are fed twice a day with cereals and grass as a supplement.
The animals are slaughtered between 50 and 70 weeks at an average weight of about 50 kg.
Emus are raised for their meat (15 to 23 kg per individual), their leather (0.8 m¬≤ per bird) and their fat.
The best pieces come from the big muscles of the pelvis and the upper thighs.
Emu leather takes on a particular appearance due to the elevations produced by follicles associated with feathers.
Leather is used, often in combination with others, for small items such as shoes or wallets.
Emu fat is used for cosmetics, diet products and medications.
Unhatched eggs blanch in a few months; they can be painted or decorated.
The feathers can be used for their decorative aspect or for the filling of cushions, quilts.
Claws can be pruned and marketed as imitation gemstones.
The emu appears on the coat of arms of Australia alongside the kangaroo.

Peru is a country located west of South America.
The country is divided into three major zones, themselves divided into 11 ecoregions:
Three watersheds: The Pacific Ocean, Lake Titicaca and the Amazon River.
Natural resources include copper, silver, gold, oil, iron ores, coal and phosphates.
Fishing is also an important natural resource because of the cold Humboldt current that is rich in fish.
Burma is rich in natural resources, but the population is miserable.
The Amazon rainforest is also beginning to be exploited, especially for its wood.
Floods and landslides ("huaycos") are due to the El Ni√±o current.
In fact, this innovative equation for its time made it possible to calculate the properties of a gas as well as those of a liquid.
Many models of activity coefficients have been developed for liquid phases, with pure liquids as the standard state.
Nevertheless, the two states are at the same temperature formula_22:
with formula_58 the molar fraction of the formula_2 body in the ideal mixture.
The ratio of real fugacity to ideal solution fugacity is called coefficient of activity, it is noted formula_62:
By definition, the coefficient of activity of a body in an ideal solution is therefore equal to 1:
For the calculation of a chemical equilibrium, some approximations are often made in the expression of chemical activity.
It is important to verify in any literature giving an equilibrium constant the unit in which the partial pressures are expressed.
If the recommended unit is the bar, and thus formula_85 = 1 bar, this convention is far from being used systematically.
is then reduced to the partial pressure of the body in the mixture:
Recall that the activity has no dimension, the fact of not noting formula_85 is only a simplification of writing.
is then reduced to the concentration of the body in the mixture:
is then reduced to the molality of the body in the mixture:
Recall that the activity has no dimension, the fact of not noting formula_92 or formula_96 is only a simplification of writing.
Activity models are mainly used in the calculation of phase equilibria.
In other words, if there are equilibrium phases formula_101, the chemical potentials of any body formula_2 present meet the equality:
This equality is equivalent to that of the fugacities of the body formula_2 in the different phases: formula_105.
Then, introducing the vapor phase-formuctivity coefficient, the expression of the vapor phase fugacity:
The √©galit√© des fugacit√©s √† l'√©quilibre des phases formula_114 induced the expression of the approche formula_115 (gamma-phi):
We also deduce from this expression the partition coefficient of the formula_2 body between the two phases, noted formula_117:
This different reference state approach for both phases is called the "formula_115" approach (gamma-phi).
The fugacity approach used for both phases is called the "formula formula" (phi-phi).
Both models of the formula_115 approach pose numerical convergence problems around the critical point.
The main point of convergence between the European and American approaches concerns the big banks.
The fugacity of all formula_2 bodies in this state is then established as follows.
This convention being applicable to all the constituents of the mixture, it is called "symmetrical convention".
with formula_146 the molar volume of the pure body in the liquid state.
By integrating the expression above between formula_129 and formula_44 the pressure of the mixture, we obtain:
Finally, considering the variation of the chemical potential of a perfect pure gas as a function of the constant temperature pressure:
The fugacity of the body formula_2 pure in the state of liquid to formula_44 and formula_22 is worth:
The equality of the chemical potentials in vapor phase and in liquid phase leads according to the symmetrical convention to:
We also deduce from this expression the partition coefficient of the formula_2 body between the two phases, noted formula_117:
For pressures of the order of magnitude of atmospheric pressure, the correction of Poynting is negligible: formula_209.
If we consider the vapor phase as a mixture of perfect gases, then formula_210 and formula_211.
Similarly, if we consider the liquid phase as an ideal solution, then formula_212.
Before developing the mathematical formalism of the asymmetrical agreement, it is necessary to define the Henry constant.
Let formula_222 be the fugacity of the formula_2 body with infinite dilution in a formula_224 solvent:
At infinite dilution of a formula_2 body in a formula_224 solvent, the formula_2 chemical potential of formula_2 is infinitely negative:
the infinite dilution fugacity can only be zero:
Henry's constant, like fugacity, has the dimension of a pressure.
Henry's constant "is not" the infinite dilution formula_2 body fugacity: formula_238.
Considering the solution of the gaseous formula-2 body dissolved in the formula_224 liquid solvent as an ideal solution, we write:
with formula_245 the chemical potential of the formula_2 body in ideal solution in the formula_224 solvent.
The chemical potentials of the preceding relation are defined to the same formula_44 and formula_22.
The Henry's constant is determined experimentally as a function of a formula_250 reference pressure and the formula_22 temperature.
The reference pressure can also be fixed (usually 1 atm).
Henry's constant can be calculated at another pressure formula_44, at the same temperature formula_22, according to the relation:
with formula_260 the partial molar volume of the formula_2 body infinitely diluted in the solvent formula_224.
This nonzero quantity is determined experimentally by extrapolation of the partial molar volume of the formula_2 body in the liquid mixture:
Hence the evolution of Henry's constant between two pressures:
Variation of Henry's constant with pressure: formula_267
In this convention, by definition of Henry's constant:
the passage to the limit of the infinite dilution of relation (2) gives:
For a formula_2 body in the symmetrical convention, the fugacity in the liquid phase is written:
In this convention, by definition of the fugacity of the body formula_2 pure in liquid phase:
the passage to the limit of the pure body of relation (5) gives:
The different limits (3) and (6) are due to the different reference states.
Nevertheless, they are also used to calculate the formula_281 activity coefficient as demonstrated below.
The equality of the expressions (2) and (5) of the fugacity in liquid phase gives:
For a dissolved gas, the fugacity in the state of pure liquid formula 11 is purely fictitious.
By passing equality (7) to the limit of infinite dilution:
because formula_112 defined to formula_288 and formula_236 defined to formula_290 do not depend on formula_189.
By introducing the infinite dilution formula_2 body activity coefficient defined by:
By introducing this relation (8) into equality (7), we finally obtain:
Moreover, with relations (1), (4) and (9), we have:
The infinite dilution coefficient of activity therefore represents the difference between the two ideal reference solutions.
The fictitious fugacity of the body formula_2 in the form of pure liquid with formula_44 and formula_22 is worth:
The equality of the chemical potentials in vapor phase and in liquid phase leads according to the asymmetrical convention to:
We also deduce from this expression the partition coefficient of the formula_2 body between the two phases, noted formula_117:
Since liquids are not very compressible, we suppose that the molar volume depends only on the temperature, so we obtain:
For pressures of the order of magnitude of the atmospheric pressure, the Poynting correction is negligible: formula_344.
If we consider the vapor phase as a mixture of perfect gases, then formula_210.
Similarly, if one considers the liquid phase as an ideal solution, then formula_346.
"Note: the same approach is theoretically applicable to all phases, gas, liquid or solid.
Nevertheless, it is mainly used for condensed liquid and solid phases.
For free formula_354 enthalpy, the identity of the chemical potentials and partial free molar enthalpies makes it possible to write:
The second term is therefore the partial free molar enthalpy of excess:
From the free excess enthalpy, all other excess magnitudes can be calculated:
Excess free enthalpy is therefore of particular importance in calculating the properties of condensed phases:
The extensive quantities of the real liquid mixture are thus calculated by applying the definition of the magnitudes of excess:

But he had received the news that Robert Peary had announced that he had already reached it (which was later disputed).
Amundsen expected that the conquest of the South Pole would assure him the glory as well as the financing of the following explorations.
Pretending to prepare for the North, he secretly organized his departure for the South.
But getting to the South Pole first did not go without saying.

In 1926, after flying over the North Pole in an airship, Amundsen became the first to reach both poles.
His mother is pressuring him to move away from the sea and wants him to become a doctor.

Amundsen believed (falsely) that the glacier remained on "terra firma" and therefore would be safe.
Amundsen names their camp at South Pole Polheim, "House at Pole".

The possession of the vehicle is often done automatically "without a counter":
Vehicles can be borrowed and returned at any time of the day or night.
It allows owners to make their car profitable, and renters have cars of all types, volumes and ages.
Here, the taking possession of the vehicle can be done by exchange of keys.
The return of the vehicle then depends on the agreement between the owner and the tenant.
A website and / or a smartphone application provide access to the vehicle and return it at the end of the journey.
(For example in Ulm, where the car-sharing concept developed by "Daimler", Car2go is not subject to any reservation).
Carsharing is an innovative solution, particularly effective in eco-districts planned to operate without cars, and the following situations:
Locally, combined subscriptions have been set up by a large number of cities with car-sharing services.
These subscriptions combine a public transport subscription and a car-sharing subscription, at a favorable rate.
A car-sharing system for electric vehicles was set up in 2013 by the Poitou-Charentes region under the name Regionlib.
The vehicles are Mia, Zoe (2 in Niort, 1 in Saintes) and a Kangoo Maxi (in Niort).
2010 and 2011 saw the appearance of Drivy, Carlili, Koolicar, OuiCar, Carfully, Livop, Deways, Buzzcar, Tripndrive, TravelerCar, Carnomise (airports) etc.
Each subscriber can access a driverless vehicle for the journey of his choice and for a limited time.
A decree in Council of State sets the conditions for obtaining the label.
There are also car-sharing solutions for companies and their employees.
France-Autopartage is a cooperative network of carsharing companies, which makes it possible to pool investments and promote the exchange of experiences.
Created in 2002, it brings together 11 traditional car-sharing operators and is present in 50 cities.
In 2013, the France-Autopartage network, which has 15,000 subscribers, changes its commercial brand to become CITIZ.
Finally, since the beginning of October 2013, the Orange group has chosen Mobility Tech Green for its carsharing service.
In Belgium, the historic car-sharing operator is a company created by the NPO Taxistop: Cambio.
The company Zen Car offers a network of electric carsharing in Brussels.
It was created in 1997, following the merger of two cooperatives created simultaneously in 1987.
there is also another company that offers this service is AUTOPLATEAU with several cars on the Plateau Mont-Royal.
It offers small vehicles and less fuel-hungry cars.
In early 2013, ZipCar was acquired by Avis, the US rental group.
Streetcar, created in 2004, was acquired by Zipcar in 2010
With the witkar, the Netherlands conducted one of the first car-sharing experiments between 1974 and 1986.
Gsteig, formerly known as "Ch√¢telet", is a municipality in the administrative district of Upper Simmental-Saanen in the canton of Bern.
To the south-east of the town is the Spitzhorn, which overlooks Lake Sanetsch.
We find traces of the village until 1312, it was then called "Chastelet", former French name.
At an unknown date, a hamlet was destroyed by a landslide at Ussers Gr√ºnd.
A castle, mentioned in 1458, monitored the access to the Pillon Pass and the S√©nin Pass.
The church of St. Theodule, consecrated in 1453 as a subsidiary of Saanen, was established as a parish after 1500.
More than half of the working population works outside the municipality, especially in Gstaad.
They account for half of the world's labor force and nearly 70 percent of consumer demand.
Occupied by the USSR in 1940, Lettonie devient une R√©publique sovi√©tique et ne recouvre sa souverainet√© in 1990.
The national currency is then called lats, and the hundredth part of the lats is called santƒ´ms.
The Latvian ruble remains in circulation with the lats, at the rate of 1 Lat = 50 Latvian rubles.
On November 2, 1922, the Bank of Latvia issued the first provisional banknotes: 500 rubles banknotes with surcharge.
From 1922 to 1940, the Bank of Latvia issues banknotes in lats.
All tickets are printed in the United Kingdom from 1924 to 1938 to meet minimum security criteria.
The Ministry of Finance issues treasury bills with denominations of 5, 10 and 20 lats.
These notes are printed within the State Securities Printing House.
Les auteurs des dessins sont Julijs Madernieks, Burke Dzenis, Wilhelm Krumins, Herman Grinberg et Rihards Zarins.
In 1934, the 50 lats banknotes represented the Latvian Prime Minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis, who established an authoritarian regime in 1936.
Most notable was the victory of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis on 2 October.
The Latvian Lat then adheres to the Sterling Block on the basis of a fixed exchange rate of 1 British Pound = 25.22 Lats.
It (re) founds the Bank of Latvia, as a central bank, able to issue a national currency.
Legitimacy, not technology, is the currency of central banks.
By using electronic money, central banks could continue to stabilize inflation just as they do now.
The Latvian laws "On Banks" and "On the Bank of Latvia" reinforce the status of the latter as the central bank.
The lat which designers GunƒÅrs L≈´sis and JƒÅnis Strupulis were reintroduced in 1993.
2004: The Bank of Latvia with the help of artists continues to work on the model of the euro coins of Latvia.
Public opinion has determined, in this free competition of ideas, what it wants to see on the reverse side of national plays.
These three motifs are Latvian patriotic symbols and represent the love and fight for national freedom and pride.
It plans to join the euro area in 2011 or 2013, after missing its entry in 2007.
Microsoft FrontPage (Microsoft Office FrontPage) is proprietary software that was included in the Microsoft Office suite between 1997 and 2003.
Since December 2006, it has been replaced by Microsoft Expression Web and Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer.
Vermeer Technologies Incorporated was purchased by Microsoft in 1996 for the sole purpose of including FrontPage in the Office suite.
Like any WYSIWYG editor, FrontPage hid the HTML code from the user.
This allowed novice users to easily create a website.
The first version of Microsoft-branded FrontPage was released in 1996 when Windows NT 4.0 Server was released.
FrontPage used a group of extensions known as IIS.
The second group includes what is known as "frequent variants with low penetrance".
These extensions were enhanced by a new set of extensions to allow FrontPage integration into the Microsoft Office suite as early as 1997.
Both groups of extensions had to be installed on the client machine to enable FrontPage.
As a result, the development of Microsoft Office FrontPage was stopped.
Some knowledge of the code is sometimes practical and even necessary in some cases.
Layers allow you to place items in a less static way on the page.
There is also a large selection of interactive buttons to create dynamic menus.
Some features that are part of the latest version of Microsoft FrontPage:
As with any WYSIWYG web page editor, experienced web developers blame it for the poor quality of the product code.
Despite all, FrontPage 2003 could generate valid XHTML code, if the user requested it.
Microsoft introduced two new products to replace FrontPage: Microsoft Expression Web and Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer.
Its lands are exploited for raising cattle in huge farms called "estancias" or coveted for their important natural resources.
It represents important ecological and geological interests that arouse envy.
The etymology of the word "Patagonia" has been the subject of much research and controversy.
This literature was in vogue at the time it was sans doute connue Magellan and Pigafetta.
In this vast contrast, it is possible to distinguish Patagonia in different geographical areas:
Despite their lower altitude, the ascent of these summits represents technical difficulties as important as those encountered in the Himalayas.
During maximum ice expansion, 30% of the Earth's surface is covered by ice.
Permafrost extends from the ice edge several hundred kilometers further south.
The southern Andes Cordillera is covered by the Patagonian Glacier.
Four major glaciations have been identified, separated by interglacial periods.
These major changes (glaciation and retraction) will profoundly alter the morphology of the landscapes of present-day Patagonia.
Thus formed the glacial valleys, the U-shaped valleys and glacial cirques.
There remains today a huge ice cap (or ice field) called Campo de Hielo Sur.
Located mainly in Patagonia of Chile, it is the third ice cap in the world after Antarctica and Greenland.
But, the observation of the satellite photos since 1990 shows that the glacier is in decline.
To the east of the Andean Cordillera, this region only concerns the Patagonia of Argentina.
These areas are suitable for breeding where 13 million beasts of Argentina's Patagonia are concentrated.
This accelerates the process of erosion and the depletion of soils already affected by the increasingly arid climate.
The most affected region is the province of Santa Cruz where there is talk of future desertification.
These biomes are characterized by a moderate climate with low rainfall in the low to moderate areas of relief.
The sea is often very formed and the winds are violent and sudden.
The region of Comodoro Rivadavia has the largest oil reserve in Patagonia.
These deposits are the largest oil reserves discovered in the ocean in recent years.
Offshore, in the Scotia Sea, is the Island of the States, which has been a nature reserve since 1991.
It is between this peninsula and this island that is located the famous strait the Mayor.
The South Pacific coast of Patagonia extends from latitude 41 ¬∞ S to the southern tip of Chile.
During the last glaciation, this place was covered by glaciers which strongly eroded the reliefs.
Then appears a multitude of islands in the western curvature of the Darwin mountain range without any human presence.
The part between Puerto Montt and Puerto Natales is very close between the Pacific Ocean and the Andean Cordillera.
The rainfall is very high and it is much colder than in the North.
During the Pinochet dictatorship, the authorities made attempts at settlement, which were failures.
Only the fishing village of Puerto Ed√©n remains assisted by the current government.
The coast ends at Cape Froward in Chile, on the Brunswick Peninsula.
This course is the most southern point of the American continent.
This mountainous terrain ends at State Island at the eastern end of Tierra del Fuego.
This region is distinguished by its mountainous and wooded terrain especially on its southern part and its coastline.
These forests consist mainly of trees of the family Nothofagus are called "fuegian" forests.
Rainfall is highest in late fall (May, June) and early spring (November, December).
The Anacleto geological formation is part of the R√≠o Colorado subgroup of the Neuqu√©n geological formations group.
Bones of an "Aeolosaurus" ("Aeolosaurus rionegrinus", Powell, 1987) were discovered in 2003.
This sauropod dinosaur lived at the end of the Cretaceous in Argentina.
The history of Patagonia is closely linked to the general history of Argentina and Chile.
It is here, to remember the major historical phases that have marked the current Patagonia.
BC, late Pleistocene and early Holocene (late late Paleolithic).
These are the oldest sites in southern Patagonia.
on the walls of the Cueva de las Manos (R√≠o Pinturas ("stylistic B", second level cultural).
Both sites are declared World Heritage by UNESCO.
He thus opens the "route of spices" by the west and the way to the circumnavigation.
The map of 1628 and that of 1635, designate the "Giants" of Patagonia.
They are much more symbolic than the more precise and topographical map of 1744.
In 1535, Spanish conquistadores attempted to conquer the territory of the Chile Valley by fighting the Incas.
Pedro de Valdivia continues his military campaign against the Mapuche Indians.
Pedro de Valdivia died in 1553 following a Mapuche insurrection.
On February 23, 1554, the troops of the famous Mapuches Lautaro fought the Spanish army during the battle of Marihue√±u.
The Spaniards are beaten, and the Mapuches push their advantage by destroying Concepcion, and most of the Spanish positions of Araucania.
What would make him first European in this southern zone just after Fernand de Magellan.
This line of demarcation imposed on Mapuches has considerably reduced their hunting grounds.
A. Roca, new Minister of War after the death of A.
Today the Conquest of the Desert is very controversial and provokes controversy.
Indeed, Argentine historians have shown that it was a genocide.
Salesian missions have been developed up to Tierra del Fuego and on Dawson Island, notably with Father Alberto Maria De Agostini.
Martin Gusinde, Jesuit lived from 1918 to 1924 in Tierra del Fuego and studied the Native Americans who still lived there.
For a long time, the Biob√≠o River marks the border between the colonial government and the Amerindian tribes.
Thus begins a period known as the Old Homeland, which will last until the disaster of Rancagua in 1814.
The following year, the independence of Chile is declared and the country is under the authority of Bernardo O'Higgins.
The country is getting organized and is starting to expand its influence on the continent both north and south.
In 1839, Chile tries to take control of the southern regions.
It extends its territory in Araucania and colonizes Llanquihue, Osorno and Valdivia by bringing German settlers.
Finally, the colonization of the southern territory ends with the "pacification" of Araucania in 1881.
Two years later, he is expelled and repatriated to France.
There, he continues his fight by launching a subscription that meets only the mockery of the press.
For example, it has succeeded in reducing poverty by half in the last fifteen years.
Agriculture and livestock are the main activities of the central and southern regions of the country.
Chile is also experiencing strong growth in the fisheries sector.
As a result, the country became the largest exporter of salmon, surpassing Norway's levels in 2006.
There are many salmon farms established in the river beds in southern Chile.
In Argentina, between 1880 and the 1920s, the massive influx of European immigrants and foreign capital generated a remarkable economic boom.
In 1913, at its peak, Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world.
The wool and meat of the pampas and Patagonia supply the world.
However, starting in 2003, economic growth resumed and in 2005 it reached 9.2%.
No developing country has achieved the economic growth needed to become a developed country without industrialization.
At the international level, under British arbitration, the border problems with Argentina in the southern Andean zone are being solved.
Both countries pledged to accept British arbitration in 1967.
However Jorge Rafael Videla declares the judgment null, and the possibility of a war with Argentina is imminent.
It is necessary to add the possibility of a cuadrillazo (war with Argentina, Peru and Bolivia).
Burst the conflict of the Beagle, in which Chile is opposed to Argentina.
In 1833, the United Kingdom established a colony there, but Argentina maintained since its territorial claim.
Patagonia was shared between Argentina and Chile in 1881.
Each province is then subdivided into departments and then "municipalities" (municipalities).
The politician is elected by the inhabitants and is called "gobernador (ra)".
The territory of Chilean Patagonia is taken here in the broad sense, that is to say including the whole region of Araucania.
Traditionally, the Patagonia of Chile integrated only the province of Palena and excluded the region of Auracania and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Rivers.
Each region is then subdivided into provinces and then municipalities (municipalities).
The XIV Rivers Region, with Valdivia as capital, as division of the current Los Lagos region.
On December 19, 2006, the Chilean Congress accepted this law.
The Region of 'Arica y Parinacota' was effective on October 9, 2007. </ small>
These two basins, characterized by a large number of small deposits, are mature.
The main hope for increasing oil and gas reserves lies in offshore exploration.
Future production is estimated at 5 Gbbl, a potentially generous figure (more than double the proven reserves reported).
In South America, and particularly in Patagonia, sheep farming is still an active industry.
Chile is also experiencing strong growth in the fisheries sector.
It comes in sixth place worldwide with 4 to 5 million tons per year.
As a result, the country became the largest exporter of salmon, surpassing Norway's levels in 2006.
There are many salmon farms established in the river beds in southern Chile.
But with the opening to global competition, production including cereals remains insignificant.
San Mart√≠n de los Andes in the province of Neuquen with San Carlos de Bariloche are winter sports destinations.
The road network is grid-shaped and connects all the urban areas of Patagonia.
It crosses the Andean cordillera, in several sectors (Puyehue, Lan√≠n, Los Alerces, Coyhaique ...) thus connecting Chile and Argentina.
Patagonia is crossed by the mythical Pan-American Highway and National Highway 40.
These join at Rio Gallegos the "national road 3" which is the only road to reach Ushuaia.
The road network consists mainly of dirt tracks and macadam on certain portions and around urban areas.
Gunther Pl√ºschow, German aviator was the first to fly over Patagonia from Argentina and Chile.
He killed himself during a second air expedition to Patagonia in 1931 near the Perito Moreno glacier.
Ses √©tapes seront, Bahia Blanca, San Antonio Oeste, Trelew, Comodoro Rivadavia, Puerto Deseado, San Julian, Rio Gallegos and Punta Arenas.
Today, the network between the main cities of Patagonia are operated by each of the two countries separately.
Political tensions have never allowed the development of extra-border air links apart between the two capitals.
The creation of infrastructure such as airports depends mainly on the economic benefits of tourism-related sites.
That's why a city as southern as Ushuaia has a modern airport with a track that can accommodate large carriers.
The two main airlines in Patagonia are LAN Airlines and Aerol√≠neas Argentinas.
There were two lines to Patagonia from Buenos Aires via Bah√≠a Blanca to Zapala and San Carlos de Bariloche.
The Aluar factory in Puerto Madryn began importing bauxite and then producing aluminum in 1974.
The latter is the southernmost vineyard in the world.
Neither the Incas nor the Conquistadors succeeded in submitting them.
This formidable resistance inspired the famous epic poem "La Araucana" (1569, 1578 and 1589) by Alonso de Ercilla.
In Chile, it was not until 1882, after a long series of military campaigns, that Cornelio Saavedra succeeded in submitting them.
Their way of life has particularly interested the painter Johann Moritz Rugendas.
In its history, Chile regularly undergoes earthquakes.
For example, in Valdivia in 1960, an earthquake ravaged the city and its surroundings.
In comparison, in 2000, French consumption of beef amounted to 26 kilos per inhabitant.
The guests participate in the mat√© ritual accompanied by "tortas fritas" (donuts) at the dulce de leche.
The cazuela prepared according to the local products is a typical and traditional dish of Chile.
The "King crab" or "Centolla" (Lithodes santolla) is a very popular dish in Ushuaia, Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales.
In rural areas, meat is also used as a stew or stew.
Trout and salmon, introduced species, are fished in the many streams and lakes.
The products of the land (fruits and vegetables) almost non-existent are imported from the richer regions of the north of the country.
As Chile and Argentina are not short of wines, they are preferred to foreign wines.
In 1998, Matt Blunt was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in Republican colors.
In 2000, he was elected Missouri Secretary of State, just as his father had been a few years earlier.
He was then the first Republican governor since 1921 to have a favorable majority in both chambers of the state.
Its priority is then to reduce the debt and the expenditure of the State, to balance the budget balance without raising the taxes.
They would still be able to raise taxes to settle their debt.
Budget cuts he made in particular in social programs were then particularly criticized by his opponents.
The social program and the technological program depend on each other.
In the region, the name of the municipality is often abbreviated simply as "Saint-L√©on".
Saint-L√©on-le-Grand shares its toponym with another municipality located in Mauricie in the Regional County Municipality of Maskinong√©.
The Gentiles are named Leonese and Leonaises while the Gentiles of Saint-L√©on-le-Grand in the Mauricie are named L√©ongrandais and L√©ongrandaises.
Saint-L√©on-le-Grand is located on Route 195 halfway between Lac-Humqui and Amqui.
Most of this territory is mountainous and covered with forests.
This territory is part of the townships of Humqui and Pinault.
The eponymous parish of Saint-L√©on-le-Grand is located in the Archdiocese of Rimouski and, more specifically, in the pastoral region of La Matap√©dia.
Saint-L√©on-le-Grand is part of the tourist region of Gasp√©sie in the tourist sub-region of the Matap√©dia Valley.
Saint-L√©on-le-Grand is located at the foot of the mountains that form the Appalachian Mountains in the section of the Chic-Chocs Mountains.
3.8% of the population is fluent in Canada's two official languages.
29.7% of the population aged 15 and over in Saint-L√©on-le-Grand do not have an education diploma.
54.9% of the population only have a high school or vocational diploma.
(On average, those with only a high school diploma or less have few prospects.)
The territory was initially a forest concession owned by Price.
The first settlers arrived in 1896 from Baie-des-Sables, Cap-Chat, Sainte-F√©licit√©, Chicoutimi and Lac-Saint-Jean.
In contrast to custom, the civil erection took place before the canonical erection of the parish.
For its part, the post office was created in 1903.
A major fire broke out in a business in 1941 and destroyed a dozen houses in Saint-L√©on-le-Grand.
Saint-L√©on-le-Grand's economy revolves around agriculture and forestry.
There are several hiking trails in the mountains in Saint-L√©on-le-Grand.
The municipal elections are held every four years and are carried out en bloc without territorial division.
Il r√©clame du social-lib√©ralisme became part of the Alliance the center droit au pouvoir coalition from 2006 to 2014.
Gusm√£o had organized a coalition with three other center-left parties.
The FP is currently the seventh party in the Riksdag in terms of numbers (eight parties represented).
In 2015, he changed his name again for Les Lib√©raux.
On September 5, Party Secretary Johan Jakobsson voluntarily chose to resign.
The party calls for "social responsibility without socialism".
Over time, this has evolved into a clearer position to the right of the political spectrum.
He also opposed the various communist dictatorships of the Third World.
In addition, party members maintain a number of small "networks" that focus on particular issues.
This caused a split in 1923, following an internal dispute over the prohibition of alcohol.
The PF actively campaigned on the themes of the fight against terrorism and crime.
The electoral base of the People's Party is mainly made up of middle-class voters.
He is the son of Louise Annette Talley Dixon and Darrell Bishop.
He studied piano at the age of 5 and did most of his schooling at San Diego College.
He also studies music at the United States International University.
In 1989, he joined a Comedy club and began the "stand-up".
He then takes the stage name of Jamie Foxx, in tribute to comedian Redd Foxx.
In 1992, Jamie Foxx began his film career in Barry Levinson's "Toys".
In 1996, he was the star of his own sitcom entitled "The Jamie Foxx Show" and inspired by his own life.
In 2002, however, he remains in the shadow of star Will Smith for Michael Mann's sports biopic, "Ali".
The same year, he lent his features to the legend of soul Ray Charles for the biopic "Ray".
He is the fourth African-American actor to receive this award, after Sidney Poitier in 1963 and Denzel Washington in 2002.
Still in the Oscars of the cinema, he is elected best actor of the year 2005.
He then returns to the historical musical fresco for "Dreamgirls", where he plays alongside Eddie Murphy and Beyonc√© Knowles.
After this remarkable journey, he participates in more modest projects, while diversifying.
The same year, he is the headliner of Peter Berg's military thriller, "The Kingdom".
For the 2008 US presidential elections, he supports candidate Barack Obama.
The US presidential election campaign is worsening and with it the debate over American power.
Some events that preceded the US presidential election clearly illustrate this fight.
But with the presidential elections imminent, no US government would cut spending or raise taxes.
In the case of the US presidential elections, the term "debate" is somewhat inappropriate.
He pays homage to Michael Jackson during the BET Awards 2009 by taking over the moonwalk and "Beat It".
At the same time, he contributes to the reissue of "We are the World": "We Are the World 25 for Haiti".
He also participates in the soundtrack by composing the title "100 Black Coffins", played by Rick Ross.
In 2014, he plays the antagonist Maxwell Dillon / Electro in the blockbuster "" Marc Webb.
He is also returning to the musical in "Annie" Will Gluck.
In 2015, he decided to return to a more dramatic register by turning an American adaptation of the French polar "Nuit blanche".
Historically, the hues used to achieve a camouflaging effect are different shades of green, khaki, brown or beige.
Sometimes gray or black are also used, but in any case the colors are dull.
But since the invention of satellite imagery, these notions have evolved.
The individual camouflage appears on the helmet of German soldiers when adopting the new helmet, the Stahlhelm, introduced in 1916.
The result is immediate: the Germans are struggling to locate it.
The outfit of the non-commissioned officer Louis Guingot, which served as a test, is exhibited at the museum of the Great War of P√©ronne (Somme).
They even manage, by breaking the real lines of gear, to conceal trains running!
It was during the Great War that foreign armies used the French word "camouflage" which did not exist in their languages.
Each belligerent country adopted types of camouflage to differentiate friendly troops from enemy troops.
Each season of the year required the use of camouflage adapted to the environment.
For winter for example, white spotted dresses have appeared.
It was estimated at the time that a camouflage improved by 15% the chances of survival of an infantryman.
The modern detection means (infrared vision, radar, acoustic detection) have made the camouflage less effective but its use remains advocated.
Heir to the camouflage of German helmets and French camouflage outfits, it is composed of two, three or four colors.
These are large spots or brush strokes that are applied to an already colored fabric.
Thus "Brandt and Schick's" developed in December 1937 a motif that breaks with the technique of breaking.
This pattern is called "tree pattern", it is composed of small spots and forms reminiscent of leaves.
Tested on the battlefield, it was a success, reducing enemy commitments by 15%.
It is in 1990 that the reconstituted German army uses the camouflage of the type "flecktarn", declined also in desert version "W√ºstentarn".
It is officially in service in 2001 and is available in arid versions "DCamC arid regions (RA)" and Arctic.
The US military is not left out and each body develops its own digital camouflage:
He competed with the camouflage UCP (Universal Camouflage Pattern) to replace US Army stocks.
Developed by the company Crye Precision, it has the distinction of being off road.
In February 2010, it is announced that it will be adopted by the totality of the US Army forces in this country.
Mirage camouflage by Bulldog Equipment is under study by the US Army.
It is a digital camouflage with a very large number of colors, between 6 to 7 colors.
FFOMECBLOT is the acronym for "Background, Shape, Shadow, Movement, Shine, Color, Noise, Light, Smell and Traces".
It is a mnemonic means for francophone soldiers to keep in mind the fundamentals of camouflage.
Improving Military Resources: Military assets are the cornerstones of our security.
In FETTA (Elemental Training All Weapons) of the 1980s, FOMBECTO stands for "Shape, Shadow, Movement, Noise, Shard, Color, Traces, Smell".
A variant is FORMATT, for "Shape, Shadow, Reflection, Movement, Background, Tone, Traces".
The declension of this word corresponds to "Shape, Shadow, Reflection, Movement, Background, Tone-tone, Smell, Sound, Electro-magnetism".
The light reflected by a body is not limited to the visible.
The camouflages are composed of patterns applied mainly to textiles, which hide the presence but do not hide it.
The thermo-optical camouflage will completely hide the body from the enemy's vision.
American army laboratories develop camouflage making the wearer invisible.
These allow the reflection of light from one side of the body to the other.
Thus, a man standing in front of a black wall will be seen with a black hue.
Sensors (placed on the back) bring out the same hue (on the belly).
It is also developed for armored vehicles and other heavy vehicles.
Optical camouflage is actually a kind of active camouflage.
If we project an image on a hidden object, it will give the illusion of being transparent.
To obtain this optical camouflage, the researchers use a process called "X'tal vision".
The Nazis found immediately a military application, for the night detection of enemy troops.
The natural green of the flora reflects this part of the spectrum while the human body, which absorbs it, appears darker.
Farben is developing a chemical agent with high reflectivity called "Hydron Olive GX".
It contains sulphide and is incorporated into the green parts of Nazi camouflage.
For their part, the Americans did not fully master infrared vision techniques.
It was only in 1965, during the Vietnam War, that the US Army added reflective dyes to military uniforms.
In 1981, camouflage "M81 Woodland" fully integrated reflective agents.
But during the early 1980s, the US military was given new missions in the Persian Gulf.
She realizes that the M81 Woodland becomes a handicap for the arid zones.
The hot object appears clearly, which detaches it from the darker background.
The use of a poncho allows the diffusion of heat and breaks the human form.
Another technique is to develop low emission textiles or paints, most often incorporating metallic particles.
In 1958 he is also with Jo√´l Le Theule, mayor of Sabl√©-sur-Sarthe, who will become deputy and Gaullist minister.
Then he continued his studies at SciencesPo and managed to avoid the national service in Algeria.
It carries out this one, under the cooperation, from 1962 to 1964 in Gabon.
He attends the military coup against President Leon Mba.
It will keep from this period a network of relations among the elites Gabonese.
He obtained his first major editorial success with "Affaires Africaines" where he denounced the networks set up by Jacques Foccart.
He explained it in "Last Wills, Last Fights, Last Sufferings".
His biographical essay on Jacques Foccart won him a trial, which he won.
Since the early 1990s, he has diversified his investigations.
Christine Mital wrote in "Le Nouvel Observateur" of March 15, 2001 about him: "He wants to be an investigator.
Let's say that in any case it belongs to a rare species: one that takes time before writing.
According to a survey published in January 2008 by "L'Arche", this quote is a fake.
In February 2009, the publication of a book of critical inquiry on Bernard Kouchner, "The World according to K.", triggers a national controversy.
The author claims to rely on a thorough investigation and access to unpublished documents to establish the following:
Pierre P√©an reviews these events in his book "Carnages" (2010) and highlights the role of American diplomacy in Rwanda.
According to him, the United States would block any attempt to investigate the perpetrators of the attack of 6 April 1994.
Even after an unsuccessful assassination attempt, the United States has once again quashed requests for help.
In November 2011, the Court of Cassation definitely dismissed these associations.
Consultancy contracts have thus existed with Gabon and the Republic of Congo.
The foreign press ("The Guardian", "The Independent", "The Washington Post") echoes the accusations against Bernard Kouchner.
On the political spectrum, the right sided with the Foreign Minister while the left hesitates.
The southern dynasties faced them: Song of the South (420-479), Qi of the South (479-502), Liang (502-557) and Chen (557-589).
Under their aegis, the South experienced a marked demographic and economic development.
In 220, when the last Han emperor is deposed, three kingdoms share China: Wei, Han and Wu.
This country then enters a long period of division that lasts until 589.
During the unrest that followed, the last home of the Jin in North China, Chang'an, fell in 316.
The new Jin dynasty relied on many Chinese emigrants from the North, fleeing regimes founded by non-Han.
This setback was an opportunity for many of their vassals to emancipate themselves and defeat them.
The period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties is therefore the heir of this long era of conflict and division.
It was one of the major data of the Northern and Southern Dynasty period.
Northern China was organized around the Yellow River Valley.
In general, the North was divided between several political entities founded and led by non-Chinese.
The South, on the other hand, was controlled by dynasties founded by Chinese people succeeding one after the other.
The military conflicts between North and South were constant because of the persistence of China's desire for unification.
As is often the case with this type of mental representation, it is difficult to know to what extent they reflect reality.
These are groups of people traditionally considered as "barbarians" ("Hu") by the Han.
Most of the kingdoms founded in North China from 317 on were by barbarian military leaders.
These peoples have greatly contributed to forging the medieval Chinese civilization.
They have obviously had an influence on the culture of southern Chinese states, but this has been little studied.
These regions undoubtedly served as a relay for the rise of Buddhism in India.
To the Far East, namely Korea and Japan, it is rather the Chinese influence that dominates.
The kingdoms of the South were also in touch with Korea and Japan by sea.
Sima Guang's "Zizhi Tongjian" (1019-1086) is also an important source.
In the South, the first decades of the century were marked by greater instability in the eastern Jin kingdom.
Huan Xuan was defeated, and what remained of the Jin court passed under Liu Yu's thumb.
It was then that he chose to return to Jiankang to proclaim himself emperor, founding in 420 the Southern Song Dynasty.
Henceforth the aristocracy of the South was deeply rooted in the southern countries, and no longer sought as much as before to reconquer the North.
His son and successor Xiao Baojuan was equally murderous, before being threatened by his brother Xiao Baorong.
The sinister reforms of Xiaowendi were followed by his successors, who tried more and more to erase their Xianbei heritage.
He gathered a northern general, Yuan Hao, and mounted an expedition to be enthroned by the Wei.
Despite the capture of several enemy cities, this campaign was eventually repulsed and the pretender was killed by Erzhu Rong.
With the most powerful army, Gao Huan sought to invade his western rival, but he was defeated in Shayuan (537).
He was defeated by the Oriental Wei, who then tried to convince Wudi to deliver them.
Hou Jing then rebelled, and managed to seize Jiankang, capturing and imprisoning Wudi who died soon after.
He ensured the continuity of the Liang dynasty (imperial name Yuandi).
In the two Wei kingdoms, the puppet emperors enthroned by the victorious generals were finally eliminated.
The power actually belonged to Yuwen Hu, the nephew of Yuwen Tai, who made and defeated several emperors.
With his success as the undisputed master of the South, he founded the Chen Dynasty in 557.
The Qi's attitude towards them made the Chen become allies of the Zhou.
The rivalries within the Xianbei aristocracy among the Qi led to several bloody episodes that destabilized their administrative and military apparatus.
In 573-575, the Chen managed to take several territories in the Huai area.
His death the following year marked a halt in the offensives of his kingdom, temporarily sparing the Chen.
The first years of his reign were marked by the founding of a new, very large capital near Chang'an in Daxingcheng.
In 587, he annexed the kingdom of the later Liang, which offered him a gateway to the South.
China was reunited again after almost four centuries of division.
Political and social developments in the Northern and Southern Dynasties are still poorly understood.
It is difficult enough to draw a clear picture of this period.
The succession was in principle from father to son, or at least within the same imperial family.
In these times marked by many conflicts, war remained an essential factor of social and dynastic change.
These warriors fought with the spear, the sword and more and more with the sword.
The fighters on foot had a variety of weapons: bows, crossbows, swords, daggers, spears, halberds.
Political and military power belonged first and foremost to members of the imperial entourage.
The Imperial Secretariat ("zhongshu sheng") and Chancery ("menxia sheng") were the centers of the main decisions.
They were recaptured and standardized under the northern Zhou then the Sui and the Tang.
The actual attributions of the titles of the higher administration are often misunderstood because the texts are not very explicit.
The institutions of this period are often characterized as "aristocratic", although this must undoubtedly be relativized in several cases.
The main role of their directors was to maintain the police and levy taxes.
At the local level, there were also city districts and villages ("ling" for both), with their own administrators.
The troubled political situation and the many changes of government had resulted in the disorder of public finances.
Armies requiring a lot of income, we often used expedients as needed.
The main problem for States, especially in the South, was therefore to identify their tax base by conducting censuses.
This had undoubtedly had the perverse effect of increasing the tax burden on those within the reach of the state.
Its owners having fully established themselves in the South, it had lost significance but still offered the exemption.
It was phased out by southern governments wishing to expand their tax base.
Marriages have also helped to make more coherent an aristocratic environment with very diverse origins.
These aristocrats, however, did not really dominate the political life of the time of division.
A network of clientele was formed around notable provincials, themselves important clients of the imperial court.
The situation of women was also marked by North / South opposition.
Women of the North were also more talented in the work of silk, also a pledge of prestige.
Secular devotees also financed religious donations, visible in art (erection of stelae).
Since the Cao-Wei, military agricultural colonies had been established (tuntian) to supply the armies.
In the South, states faced several challenges that prevented them from pursuing an ambitious agricultural policy.
Emigrants had long ago been estab- lishing domains without its consent, in defiance of its theoretical scope.
It was clearly intended primarily for areas of significant size and practicing well-organized intensive agriculture.
Concerning the methods of cultivation of the fields, these rested on the technical means of the time.
Various types of harrows are also attested, for the preparation of the soil.
Jia Sixie prescribes to select the seeds carefully before sowing them using a dibble.
Jia Sixie was the first in China to explicitly describe crop rotation.
Many vegetables grew: soy, cucumber, melon, watermelon, calabash, radish, onion, etc.
As for fruit, there was also a great variety of peaches, jujubes, pears, apples, apricots, pomegranates, etc.
Mulberry cultivation for silkworm rearing was very important.
Noodles took an important place in the Chinese diet from this period.
The cultivation and consumption of tea also flourished after the end of the Han.
Information about cities comes mainly from capitals, which have been the subject of various literary descriptions.
They were cities protected by walls, often on a space of roughly rectangular shape.
The southern part of the city was occupied by artisanal districts.
Cities did not really have a solid commercial base, and were mostly aristocratic dominated political centers.
The North Wei founded a 399 capital city in Pingcheng, near Datong in Shanxi.
Then they settled in Luoyang, the ancient capital of the later Han, rebuilt under the sinister reign of Xiaowendi in 494.
Protected by a mighty wall, it was dominated by its palatial sector serving as an administrative center, protected by its own enclosure.
The main avenue ran from the palace area in a southerly direction to the Qinhuai River that connected the city to the Yangtze River.
Unlike the northern capitals, Jiankang was a very active trading center.
The rolls of silk or cottons, however, remained important instruments of transaction.
The Wei of the North apparently only issued them from 495, in several forms (round pieces but also knives).
Buddhist monasteries, which could rely on large reserves of wealth, were also very active in trade and usury.
Artisanal activities were mainly concentrated in cities, but not only.
But northern workshops have also produced quality glaze ceramics.
With textiles (a largely feminized activity), metallurgy was the artisanal activity that most interested governments.
The steels were also of high quality, visible in the blades of the swords.
Bronze was also worked, used to produce a wide variety of objects.
Lacquerware was also in high demand, as was the case in previous periods.
Moreover, the interactions between these religions are very common, they lead to exchanges or oppositions.
It is from this time that dates the formation of a Taoist clergy ("daoshi").
Buddhism is native to India, where it appears around 500 BC.
The reflections of the first period were anchored in the properly Chinese debates, borrowing in particular from the Taoist thinkers.
Since the fall of the Han, his ideas are no longer in vogue.
They nevertheless remain present in literary circles, and through them in the imperial courts, especially in the North.
The ideals of filial piety ("xiao") and submission to the ruler ("zhang") remain very present in the intellectual universe of the time.
Other more popular beliefs and practices also existed in medieval China, again inherited from earlier periods.
The Taoist and Buddhist monks were ardent fighters of these practices.
Since the introduction of Buddhism, its links with Taoism were very pronounced.
The Taoist vocabulary was often used to translate concepts of Buddhism into Chinese.
Many currents of both religions also shared neighboring eschatological visions, foreshadowing the nearness of the end of the world.
Buddhism also had a significant impact on beliefs about the afterlife.
The ties of these two religions with the political authorities were repeatedly fluctuating.
Southern Buddhism in particular owed much to the benevolence of the imperial courts since the time of the Wu.
Xiaowu Song Dynasty was a devout devotee, who went so far as to erect a Buddhist monastery in the very precincts of his palace.
Buddhism introduced into China monasticism, previously unknown, introducing among believers a separation between monks and laity.
They became monks after a ceremony at which they had to be approved by their community.
The main one was on the Buddha's birthday, usually on the fourth day of the eighth month.
Ordinations of monks were often made on that date.
The largest, often founded at the initiative of the imperial family or aristocrats, occupy a major place in the urban space.
Their most outstanding monuments were the pagodas, Chinese variants of the Indian "stupa".
Later, the northern Qi elites patronized the development of Tianlongshan monasteries.
The temples of the South are not well known for want of descriptions.
According to a text, Jiankang included under Liang about 500 temples.
The monasteries were maintained by the agricultural estates and their dependents, which were conceded to them by the state and the aristocrats.
A myriad of monasteries had spread throughout China during the period of division.
According to some texts, there were up to 2 million monks under the northern Wei.
Northern powers attempted to control the number of ordinations and monastic foundations, especially during periods of persecution.
These moments were also the occasion to translate sacred texts, to realize poems or to carry out theological discussions.
The images, especially the statues, had a strong symbolic role.
Some texts prescribed the proportions to be followed for statues, which often required significant funding from the donees.
There were miraculous stories around some of these objects, such as statues crying or illuminating at night.
Chinese Buddhist images follow patterns invented by Indian schools.
They were especially prevalent in the North, and also Sichuan.
Some of the following styles opted for a simpler representation of drapes.
Carved stelae in bas-relief are also common, including in the South.
Laozi who has been deified is also an important figure in the Taoist pantheon.
He is accompanied by other major Taoist figures, such as Zhang Daoling, the legendary founder of the Heavenly Masters or the Jade Emperor.
The religious practices of the followers of Taoism aimed to prolong their existence and make them reach immortality.
Other fasts advocated abstinence in grains, or the limitation of the meat diet.
Traditional ancestor worship is not upset, and continues to play a major role in the religion of the Chinese.
Such a surge could play a major role in taking off economic growth.
The study of burials also highlights the strength of regional traditions.
Confucian-inspired rituals were performed there, with traditional Chinese scholars retaining a large role in this area.
At that time, one of the main popular Buddhist festivals was also intended for the dead.
Many Buddhist votive objects point to this fusion of beliefs, bearing inscriptions commemorating the lineage ancestors of the dedicants.
There were very many variants of which regional types could be highlighted.
In the Middle Yangzi region, they assume an ovoid shape in the late period.
The tombs of the emperors and their families were distinguished by their vast size.
The southern imperial tombs are located in the vicinity of the capital Jiankang.
Coffins, mostly of wood, have been little preserved.
They were generally trapezoidal in shape, with the widest side at the head of the deceased.
Some have preserved pieces of lacquer decorating religious themes.
The funeral offerings were arranged on kinds of brick altars.
Stelae or bricks inscribed can sometimes identify the deceased and the date of burial.
The mirrors often placed on the heads of the dead clearly had an apotropaic function.
The coins in the burials of the North may have had a similar role.
This explains why their presence in the stories of Chinese literature is very discreet.
Private libraries of literate bibliophiles developed, constituting an important fund for the preservation of books in these troubled times.
Literary criticism cast a new light on the realizations of the mind, and even spread to painting.
Under the southern Liang, several members of the imperial family were active in the development of poetry.
This book later became a classic in the study of Chinese poetry.
This story enjoyed great popularity during later periods, being adapted in different genres.
It thus joined the Confucian, Taoist and Buddhist themes as well.
In this meditative perspective, scholars favored individual instruments, in the first place the "qin", a kind of zither laid flat.
The narrative literature also underwent important changes during the division period.
This same period has also been characterized by rapid technological change.
Many historical works were written, many having disappeared and being known only by later catalogs.
The literate elites also appreciated the study of texts of a scientific or technical nature.
Some important works in this area were written during the Northern and Southern Dynasties.

She flattered the genius of the poet and passed all his whims to him.
These lyric dramas were set to music by the principal contemporary composers and produced on the principal stages of Italy.
The poet, the composer, the music copyist and the singers had to work together frantically.
The excluded from the circles of the aristocracy are humble origins, believing that he teaches Italian to the Archduchess Marie-Antoinette.
She was a widow and had for some time been the favorite of the emperor.
His affair with Metastasio was so intimate that it was thought that he married secretly.
The Romanina now regretted her retirement and asked her to obtain for her a contract at the theater of the imperial court.
He was ashamed of her and, tired of his requests, tried to dissuade her from coming to see him.
The tone of the letters he sent him inspired him with disappointment and even anger.
It seems that she prepared to leave Rome but died on these occasions.
Still, she made him the future heir of his personal fortune when her husband died.
And Metastasio, gnawed by pain and remorse, voluntarily gave up this inheritance.
This selfless act was detrimental to his family who had remained in Rome.
As the years went by, Metastasio's life in Vienna and the climate undermined his health and morale.
It became obvious that he was dying of mental and moral boredom.
In fact, he had survived all the members of his own family.
During his forty years after his original and creative career, his fame continued to grow.
In his library, he owned no less than 40 editions of his complete works.
They had been translated into many languages, French, English, German, Spanish and even modern Greek.
But his style suited a certain music - that of the "opera seria", virtuosos of the vocalise, dramatic sopranos.
The works of Metastasio fell into an oblivion that they did not deserve, as did the music that accompanied them.
The two men were really instinctively linked by their complementary talents.
His inspiration was full of emotion and lyricism.
The result is not pure literary expression, but an expression admirably adapted to musical language.
Let me tell you Italian poets, and I've had a special preaching for Le Tasse and for Giambattista Marino.

The Grand Hannezo is arrested and incarcerated in a prison of Saint-Di√© where he will spend four months.
He will be pardoned by the Duke following the supplication of his family.
Others are taken captive in Lorraine and are released only on payment of ransoms.

He hoped to get paid by invading the Val de Li√®pvre.
The Duke of Lorraine was not informed of this invasion until January 12, 1593.
He immediately took measures, and on the 16th of January a regiment led by L. de Bonnayde arrived at Li√®pvre.
Other troops joined them, under the orders of the bailiff of Nancy, Renaud de Gournay.
The Duchy of Lorraine is then occupied and administered by France.
In 1632, Alsace is traversed by bands of imperial and Lorraine soldiers who plunder the countryside and cities.
The Lorraine troops installed in Haguenau are decimated by typhoid and contaminate the population.
They behave inhumanly, looting, looting, torturing, raping and killing the inhabitants.
The profanations of churches are followed by the hanging of priests and monks.

By devastating the entire Liepvrette valley, the Swedes also bring the plague.
The situation is so tragic that the Superintendent of the Val gets permission to leave the valley.

From 1635 to 1641, the Li√®pvre valley is occupied by France.
Louis XIV passed twice at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines in the year 1673 on August 27th and September 3rd.
He took off in a daring raid the backbench of Anjou Benam√©nil, near Lun√©ville.
These are the meadows of the hospice of S√©lestat, designated at the time under the name of Abtissinhurst or Graveloch.
It is said that they were part of the colongere court that the Andlau Abbey owned at Kintzheim.
This forest was finally shared in 1436 between the three communes.
Logging and grazing used to be important points of friction between the different municipalities because of economic factors.
The city of Saint-Hippolyte has since held the forests of Kelblin and Hinterwald.
The treaty of Paris signed on July 18, 1718 put an end to the disputes.
If no peace treaty has ended, it is because it is not over.
The forest of Spiemont is declared to belong to the municipality of Li√®pvre and to be part of the sovereignty of Lorraine.

En devise: "¬´ Fulradi Villare in Valle Le Brahens ¬ª".
The Bavarian troops of General Deroy commanding 5000 men are the first to cross the crest of the Vosges.
Then from 1815 to 1818 Austrian occupation troops, commanded by Colonel Comte de Cassada, came to camp in the commune.
Before the appearance of the communal administration, the Lorraine villages were most often governed by a lord.
The Val de Li√®pvre was an exception, since since Charlemagne the population of the valley benefited from a special diet.
Since the Carolingian period they are the ones who actually had the real power.
But the monks of Li√®pvre will not be completely looted and will keep for a time all their property.
Thus, around 1232 the valley is protected by the lords of Eckerich.
This dynasty died when the last member of the family died around 1381.
So there was a certain anarchy in the kingdom and the valley was the subject of frequent passages.
To watch over the untimely coming and going of enemy troops, many lords built castles in the area.
The lords of Echery were powerful enough, so much so that they could mount troops for their own account.
They fought against their neighbors, and were feared and respected for their bravery.
On December 9, 1399 the treaty of Burgfried ratified the division of the valley.
This division of the valley will last for four centuries, that is until the Revolution of 1789.
The priory of Li√®pvre, which owned a good part of the valley, had very extensive judicial rights.
The same agent could cumulate very well judicial, administrative, financial or even military attributions.
In the beginning, those who exercised these multiple functions bore the title of "mayor" or mayor.
Li√®pvre and the German Rombach (now Rombach-le-Franc) made only one community.
These mayors were the representatives of the lords and not the inhabitants.
They were therefore chosen by the Lord of Hattstatt and the Duke of Lorraine.
Il pouvait occuper le ch√¢teau de Zuckmantel, who was built in Sainte-Croix-aux-Mines when he lived in the valley.
From then on it will be customary to give the title of Superintendent in all circumstances.
The Duke himself strongly and strongly reaffirms this sovereignty in various acts.
For Li√®pvre, it is the provost who is in charge of controlling the whole administration.
The mayor then declares the meeting open and notes the absences, then pronounces the fines unless there is a valid reason.
The meetings must be held in serenity and not disturbed by cries and hiccups.
Jurors who are mostly simple craftsmen receive an allowance.
The observations of the culprits are then taken into account by the mayor escque that is to say the fine.
The mayor himself is in turn accountable to the administration.
These annual pleas organized in a uniform way from 1598 by an order of Charles III lasted until the Revolution.
Subsequently, the mayor was discharged from the forest administration and then went to the grunts.
This task is entrusted to the elected and then to the next century to the sewers and collectors.
Following the French occupation during the Thirty Years War, the ducal power became more and more important in the communities.
An ordinance supplemented by that of 1753 definitively removed the right of the inhabitants to appoint their mayor and other municipal officers.
They were appointed by the provost and were to take an oath at the chief town of the jurisdiction.
From that time on, there is a mayor, his lieutenant, the sergeant, and the clerk appointed by the provost.
It was necessary to undergo the all-powerful will of the steward and his deputy bailiwick.
It was finally the edict of 8 January 1787 that created provincial assemblies, district assemblies and communal assemblies.
Only owners over 25, the parish priest, the clerk, the trustee could be elected.
All had to know at least to read and write and belong to the bourgeois class (first class of taxpayers).
From 1790, each municipality organizes the election of its own elected officials.
The rural economy is completely disorganized, the lands and forests are fallow.
It encourages the arrival of new inhabitants who will occupy abandoned houses or farms in the Val de Li√®pvre.
He also encouraged the arrival in the Val de Li√®pvre of Anabaptists to occupy abandoned farms.
They are particularly appreciated for their competence in agricultural matters by wealthy bourgeois or lords.
They are renovating and enlarging old farmhouses and abandoned farms.
After the invasions and looting of the Middle Ages, Li√®pvre struggled to recover.
A courthouse was built during the Renaissance period.
It was located at the bottom of the village, opposite the old monastery.
It was built by the Dukes of Lorraine and served as a meeting point for hunting.
At the corner facing the bridge was a spiral staircase leading from the cellar to the attic.
Its architecture left no doubt about the time when it was built: the time of the Renaissance.
The Val de Li√®pvre is attached to the death of King Stanislas Leczinski in 1766 to France.
The town of Li√®pvre counted in the Middle Ages a number of famous mines.
To the east, south of Li√®pvre are still the old mines of Creusepr√©.
The mines of Sainte-Anne, Herrschafft and Saint-Jean in Musloch were discovered in 1526.
In 1750, at the Saint-Anne mine, silver, rosette and lead were discovered.
Another mine called in the old documents "Schwymbach" (Schweinsbach) in Li√®pvre is also exploited at the same time.
Between 1533 and 1546, four new sites are open at Li√®pvre, but the research will be abandoned fairly quickly.
The Saint-Esprit mine will produce its first vein on November 4, 1583.
In 1606, the mines du Herrschafftt √† Musloch et de Saint-Esprit √† Creusepr√© are no longer abandoned.
During the Thirty Years War, work was abandoned.
During the first world war, a gold deposit was also reported in the Ch√¢tenois-Li√®pvre region.
The affirmations of Deutsche Goldschmied Zeitung raise a great curiosity and a vif interest in the Li√®pvre region.
From 1668 the Duke of Lorraine, Charles IV authorized the holding of markets and fairs at Li√®pvre.
This building will be occupied from 1816 to 1818 during the invasion by an Austrian fighter company which was then used as barracks.
In 1827 he demolished the old building and replaced it with a more modern building.
This house was built in 1739 by Mr. Brulon de Selestat who came to live in the beautiful season.
The Liepvrette gets out of bed and takes everything in its path.
In 1800 we witness a real drought: not a single drop of rain fell for 109 days.
In 1818 the rain fell for 99 days, which caused the rivers to overflow and cause new floods.
In 1829-1830 snow covered the valley for 60 days and there were frosts lasting 86 days.
On May 25, 1834 a gigantic fire reduced to ashes more than 24 houses in Li√®pvre.
On February 24, 1844 a new flood due to the large snow melt devastates the valley again.
There are many victims in Li√®pvre, including an entire family.
The railway line between Li√®pvre and La Vancelle is interrupted and the traffic will resume only eight days later.
Other floods are to be deplored, in particular those of December 23, 1919.
The church of Li√®pvre is invaded by the waters, which prevents the midnight Mass from unfolding there.
On July 7, 1933 a landslide occurred in Votembach due to the heavy storms followed by torrents of impressive waters.
Another landslide occurred in Musloch on January 15, 1936 due to flooding.
The national road 59 is cut and a ditch of four meters prevents any traffic between Li√®pvre and Sainte-Croix-aux-Mines.
Around 1349 a terrible scourge fell on all Europe: the black plague.
Several Alsatian villages near the valley are part of "confessions" that would have made (under torture) some Jews.
As a result of these rumors, many Jews were dragged by the crowd and burned on huge pyres.
Some escaped by abjuring their faith as did the children.
The property of the tortured was divided between the bourgeois and the bishop of Strasbourg.
The claims were destroyed and some pledges returned to their owners.
Faced with these massacres, the Emperor Charles IV threatened to retaliate the perpetrators of such acts.
But the destruction of the Jewish population in no way prevented the spread of the plague epidemic.
The ruminant runs to Rombach-le-Franc and Li√®pvre that Sainte Rosalie is there who puts her in the village of this terrible disease.
The plague is so severe that the superintendent of mines does not dare to come for his office.
In 1633, the "Swedes", in addition to looting, also bring the plague.
Rombach-le-Franc knows the plague and the looting but escapes fire.
The present church of Li√®pvre which is on the road of Rombach-le-Franc was probably rebuilt towards 1752.
It was destroyed during the Thirty Years War.
It contained the remains of the last lord of Eckerich who died in 1381.
They were leaning against the wall of the church, but since September 1998 these elements have been moved inside the church.
There was also in the sacristy of the parish church the shrine containing the relics of St. Alexander.
It was a small wooden box shaped like a long square, decorated externally with sculptures.
This relic was still visible in the last century, but has apparently disappeared since.
The stone that serves as a base is also decorated with symbolic subjects.
The large bell of the parish church of Li√®pvre also comes from the monastery of Saint-Alexandre, and bears the date of 1542.
This bell was melted by a Lorraine artist, Jean Lamperti from Deneuvre, near Baccarat.
The bell was unearthed a century later and mounted on the steeple of the church.
On October 5, 1760 was held the blessing of two bells ordered from brothers Joseph and Nicolas Antoine at Eurville.
The largest weighs 1800 pounds and the smallest 1200 pounds.
Then follow the signatures of the present priests, godparents and two founders.
After two centuries the bell of 1542 ceased its office again.
On April 7, 1917, the Mayor of Li√®vre asked the Conservative to intervene in favor of the historic bell.
The Spaniards claim that the body of Saint Cucufa is in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand that only his chief was brought to France.
This relic was venerated by the sacristy, which was enclosed in a little wooden frame, ornamented externally with carvings.
Another part of the relics was transported by Hilduin, abbot of Saint-Denis (835) in his abbey.
Four capitals of columns from the old monastery are currently used in the church Li√®pvre pedestals for banners.
which is seen to the right of the church was built with the remains of the old priory.
Saint Georges is the patron saint of the primatial church of Nancy, which is probably why the mention "Duchy of Lorraine" appears.
This stained glass window was made in 1911 by the Ott brothers from Strasbourg.
There is no longer any trace of the precious objects contained in the old chapel and mainly the stained glass windows.
In the Vosges and Lorraine, the term val was used, followed by the name of the principal locality.
Only a longitudinal route, whose layout varied, connected Alsace and Lorraine in the Middle Ages.
The geographical situation of Li√®pvre allowed through this road to connect the Duchy of Lorraine and the plain of Alsace.
This road was therefore a crossing point frequented for trade but also for foreign troops.
This road was improved by Fulrad in 757 with the agreement of Pepin the Short.
The latter sent him to Strasburg and asked for five hundred francs.
This precious object is now in the National Library in Paris.
Victorinus was a gang of generals from Roman armies, tyran des Gaules in 265 of the Christian era, assassinated in 268.
The other side is a monk with a book in his hand and above it the words "S.P.
Another medal was found in the early days of September 1845 near Li√®pvre.
It was in bronze of round shape and the size of a five franc coin.
On one side there is a monk praying and on the other side the same monk carried by two angels.
This building already in operation at the time of the revolution has undergone many transformations since 1789.
These pumps are placed on small four-wheeled muddy trolleys.
The commune is thus entrusted with attributions which hitherto belonged to the clergy.
The ground floor consists of a guardhouse, a storeroom, a dungeon, a kitchen and two bedrooms.
At the back, the fire pumps are stored with a stable and latrines.
On the floor, always the big room, the registry and the archives.
Later, in 1831, it will include a first company of 120 men, a second of 140 men and 106 reservists.
The National Guard had difficulty controlling this huge fire, as the relief supplies burned.
At the end of the year 1926, this covered market hall was dismantled to allow the extension work of the town hall.
The town was decorated, on February 12, 1949, with the Croix de Guerre 1939-1945.
The following tax rates are voted by the municipality of Li√®pvre.
They varied as follows compared to 2012:
Li√®pvre's investment resources are mainly divided into:
Every two years, official exchanges take place, thus making it possible to forge strong links between these two communes.
Since 1998 a street of Saint-Sylvestre-sur-Lot Li√®pvre and since 2004 a street Li√®pvre Saint-Sylvestre-sur-Lot.
Since 1999, Li√®pvre has gained 124 people, an additional 7.6%.
Between 1999 and 2005, the municipality gained 101 inhabitants and since 1975, 213 inhabitants.
Currently, people over 60 years of age still represent the largest percentage of the population of Li√®pvre.
In second place, the under 20 years represent 24.9% of the population against 25.3% in the department.
This fountain apparently fed water one of the oldest district Li√®pvre.
It was formerly known as the Charnier Chapel.
The ogives of its two gates come from the Benedictine cloisters.
In this ossuary, the skulls and shins of the dead were dug up religiously.
In this cemetery the dead of Li√®pvre, Rombach-le-Franc and La Vancelle were buried.
The excavations were therefore quite frequent hence the need to have an ossuary.
In 1922, the city council decided to restore the small chapel.
It was coated externally with plasterwork, giving the monument a lighter and more pleasant appearance.
Subsequently, generous donors helped renovate the interior walls and pavement into a commemorative chapel.
The memorial and restored chapel was blessed on October 17, 1922.
This chapel was classified as a historical monument on March 22, 1934 (ministerial decision: MH1934 / 03/22).
It comes from the old chapel of the Priory of Li√®pvre where was the tomb of the Lords of Echery.
The slab was then transferred in 1790 outside the parish church built in 1756.
Exposed to intemp√©ries, the inscriptions that are going to give you the funeral are small and small, and you can not afford them.
The basin that they support is of hexagonal form of more recent date and without decoration.
This cross found during the work was given to the parish of Li√®pvre by the company's managers.
This cross is two sided and was first placed outside the church.
To avoid the outrages of time, she was placed inside the church behind the porch.
This chapel is placed under the invocation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and placed in front of the old school.
It even has a cellar and was built on the site of an old house destroyed by a fire in 1903.
The chapel is inaugurated on Whit Monday in 1905 by the priest Legay.
This stone-terminal that had been reported by Victor Kuentzmann in 1911 seems to no longer exist.
We distinguish under the plaster part of a lion and it seems also a bull.
These paintings are under the vault of the old chapel at the entrance of the porch of the present church.
So we only find part of these old frescoes.
The fountain Saint-Alexandre was discovered quite by chance in 1987 south of the village at a place called Raincorne.
These are children of Li√®pvre having fun building a small dam that made this unexpected discovery.
They uncovered an old well that dates from the early Middle Ages, perhaps even from the time of Abbot Fulrad.
This fountain fed a tank that was located in the very precinct.
After the Revolution, the ruins of the priory have long served as a career for the inhabitants of Li√®pvre and Rombach-le-Franc.
Some of its stones are still visible or drowned in the walls of residential houses.
The census of all these old stones has not been done yet.
We can see some old stones in the following places:
Most of these inscriptions are engraved above the lintels of the doors, often awkwardly incised.
In the Val de Li√®pvre one often finds the inscriptions above the lintels of doors, either engraved or carved.
Rue du Hoimbach during the remediation work a stone from a former beating to tread was found.
She was evacuated by the company in charge of the sanitation, then recovered and brought back to the school of Li√®pvre where she can be admired.
This chapel was undoubtedly damaged during the Revolution then fell to the abandonment.
It was replaced after the First World War, in 1923 by a shelter built by the Vosges Club.
No less than sixteen associations that organize at least once a year meetings or events in the village.
The communities of the valley and the parishes did not lack resources, the population wanted to access knowledge.
The schools were then exclusively communal establishments which gave place to very few writings and functioned in a very summary way.
We can not say exactly when the primary education date dates, because of the lack of documents.
Le sous-ma√Ætre was able to teach German, well, Li√®pvre made it another part of the duchy of Lorraine.
The class must have lasted from Saint-Martin (November 11th) to Saint-Georges (April 23rd).
However, students wishing to continue their studies could do so without raising the price.
In 1864 a larger school is established in the village as well as Musloch which hosts about forty students.
The Musloch School was closed in 1950 due to the decline of students in the hamlet.
Other students take classes at private schools in Ribeauvill√©.
Meyenheim is a commune in the Haut-Rhin department in eastern France.
This town is in the historical and cultural region of Alsace.
The western boundary with the municipality of Merxheim is based on the route of the brook Wohlbach.
Even further to the west, the small brook of Wohlbach forms the inter-municipal boundary between Meyenheim and Merxheim.
The communal area is dominated by the cultivation of corn, wheat and rye.
The smallest, the Bayl wood, extends in a narrow band along the Ill, towards Oberentzen.
On an east-west axis, RD 3bis leads to Merxheim on one side and Hirtzfelden on the other.
Meyenheim is also crossed by the old line of railway of Colmar-South to Bollwiller via Ensisheim on its western part.
This neutralized line is the subject of studies for its reopening to passenger traffic).
Currently the nearest station is in Merxheim on the Strasbourg-Mulhouse line.
In addition, the departmental bus connections Mulhouse-Colmar and Oberhergheim-Guebwiller effectively complement the public transport service.
Meyenheim has a meteorological measurement station located inside the Chad Regiment.
The village enjoys a semi-continental shelter, like the rest of the central plain of Alsace.
This sector has one of the most "continentalized" climates in France.
The seasons are marked, with cold winters and hot summers.
The summer heat does not compensate for the low winter temperatures.
The most severe cold weather occurs when the north-east wind brings cold from Russia.
This cold airflow from Russia was brought by the bise for over a week.
The temperature in the plain is usually higher than in the mountains in the Vosges.
Thus, in the early morning of winter, the temperature recorded in the plain can be much lower than in the mountains.
Temperatures do not rise, unlike mountain areas, above the cloud layer.
The minimum temperatures in July are in the average of those found in France at the same latitude.
The maximum temperatures can become scorching and difficult to withstand because of a relatively high humidity.
It is not uncommon that in summer, the highest temperatures in France are found in the plain of Alsace.
The highest temperatures occur during a south / southwest flow.
This level is only exceeded in the south-west, in the Rhone valley and around the Mediterranean.
It should be noted that this frequency of heat days drops to 43 for Strasbourg and Saint-Louis.
The rainiest months (not in quantity) are May and January.
The shelter climate is due to the Vosges which form a barrier against the clouds coming from the west.
An impressive amount of rain falls on the Lorraine slopes of the Vosges.
The foehn, a soft, dry wind, blows quite frequently when a disturbance from the west occurs.
Very rarely, the foehn can reach a force equivalent to a storm.
Arriving from the south or west, we can see a foehn hole forming above the village.
Nevertheless, this phenomenon occurs more often north of Meyenheim, above the Colmar sector.
If we observe the radars of the precipitation, we often notice that the rains coming from the west are blurred while passing the Vosges.
Meyenheim is indeed a little less protected than Colmar by the disturbances coming from the south-southwest.
The crests of the Vosges, located about thirty kilometers to the west of Meyenheim, receive an impressive amount of rain.
January and February are the snowiest months, half of the precipitation occurs as snow.
The storms take preferential routes, the Alsatian topography creates a storm corridor.
50% of the hours are sunny in July and only 18% in December.
First mention of the village in 1187 under the name Meieneim.
Various discoveries attest to the presence of a Gallo-Roman habitat in the town.
- A Roman pipe of three to one cord was discovered during earthworks.

Destroyed by a fire in 1981, it has since been rebuilt.
- The presbytery, located at 11 rue de l'√âglise, rebuilt in 1723, with its carriage door dating from 1723.
At present, there are still operating and residential buildings and the dovecote.
The former 132 Colmar-Meyenheim Air Base built in the mid-1950s is located to the east of the town.
Meyenheim, outside the air base, has essentially a residential vocation.
11% of the workers are cross-border workers (both to Switzerland and to Germany).
The private sector is made up of small craft enterprises with a workforce of no more than 20 employees.
Finally, the state competes with the private sector through businesses and utilities.
The number of agricultural enterprises has been stable for 20 years contrary to the trend observed at the departmental level.
The FCM also won the title of Champion of Haut-Rhin and some day after the honorary title of Champion of Alsace.
In response to the fiscal austerity policy provoked by the Greek crisis, the university has been on strike since the start of the 2013 academic year.

Anarchism is radically opposed to any form of authority or hierarchy in all social organizations.
Anarchists advocate a society without a state based on the free association of individuals and their voluntary cooperation through federative self-management.
Modern anarchism comes from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment.
It is a plural movement embracing all sectors of society.
Since new sensibilities have emerged, such as anarcha-feminism or social ecology.
For Vivien Garcia in "Anarchism Today" (2007), anarchism "can not be conceived as a complete theoretical monument.
For many theorists of anarchism, the libertarian spirit goes back to the origins of humanity.
The earliest expressions of a libertarian philosophy can be found in Taoism and Buddhism.
Some libertarian elements of Christianity have influenced the development of anarchism, especially Christian anarchism.
From the Middle Ages, some heresies and peasant revolts await the advent on earth of a new age of freedom.
Religious movements such as the Hussites or Anabaptists were often inspired by libertarian principles.
They got out of bed whenever they wanted, drank, ate, worked, slept when the desire came to them.
No one awakened them, no one forced them to drink, eat, or do anything.
And all their rule was in this clause: Do what you want.
Go back so far in history is not without risk of anachronism or ideology.
It gives an extremely vague definition of anarchism without taking into account the historical and social conditions of the time of the facts.
Several libertarian ideas and tendencies emerge in the French and English utopias of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
Equality is only a ghost, when the rich man, by the monopoly, exercises the right of life and death of his fellow man.
What social monstrosity, what a masterpiece of Machiavellianism, what a revolutionary government!
During the summer of 1841 appeared "L'Humanitaire", a communist and materialist newspaper that claims Sylvain Mar√©chal.
For him, property thwarts the free development of individuals, it must be replaced by a fair distribution of goods.
The law must be based on "the absolute reign of Reason".
Although not using the term, William Godwin is a gradualist rather than a revolutionary.
For Stirner, the man is unique, that is, rebels against any political and social integration.
Stirner wants to restore man's freedom and restore the sovereignty and autonomy of the One.
This association is not, for the Unique, a submission, but a multiplication of its power.
But humanity is not a real entity; only the individuals that compose it are real entities.
So when I say: I want the happiness of humanity, I say implicitly: I want the happiness of individuals.
Throughout its history, the libertarian movement is punctuated by individualists, especially in France during the Belle Epoque.
For Proudhon, there can be no property without an improved state system.
For him, it is the use of a good that creates the right of possession and not his property.
Especially since social differences naturally increase over generations, especially through the process of inheritance.
For him, "property is the only force that can serve as a counterweight to the state."
Thus, Proudhon could maintain the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãownership as theft and at the same time offer a new definition as freedom.
There is a perpetual possibility of abuse, exploitation that produces theft.
But simultaneously property is a spontaneous creation of society and a defense against the insatiable power of the state.
For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is work.
What each produces is his property and that of no one else.
Considered a libertarian socialist, Proudhon refuses the capitalist possession of the means of production.
The right to the product is exclusive, "jus in re"; the right to the instrument is common, "jus ad rem".
For Proudhon, only cooperative ownership, managed by self-managed producers, allows the development of individualities.
Proudhon conceives the new society as a set of federative associations of free groups: "The workshop will replace the government".
This is how I am collectivist and not communist at all.
The central idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBakunin is liberty, the supreme good that the revolutionary must seek at all costs.
True freedom is not possible without de facto equality (economic, political and social).
The hostility of Bakunin (and of course all anarchists) to the state is final.
The formation of a "red bureaucracy" seems inevitable.
I challenge anyone to get out of this circle, and now, let's choose.
According to him, man is part of a universe governed by natural laws.
Societies and human ideas, including the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgod, depend on the material conditions of human existence.
The first true form of organization of workers 'internationalism, the International Workers' Association was founded in 1864 in London.
In September 1866, the first congress of the AIT is organized in Geneva.
Sixty delegates represent 25 sections and 11 member companies from France, Switzerland, Germany and England.
The AIT supports workers' strikes, struggles for the reduction of working time, against child labor.
From the second Congress, in Lausanne in September 1867, divergences appeared between "mutuellists" and "collectivists".
They advocate self-organization of workers in the form of cooperatives or production associations.
The debate is decided in favor of collectivist anti-state principles that advocate the socialization of the means of production.
The International Workers' Association declares that it "is neither a girl nor a sect, nor a theory.
On December 22, 1868, Bakunin wrote to Marx: "I am your disciple, and I am proud of it".
The first two sensitivities are found on a proposal relating to the socialization of the soil.
Finally, and unanimously, the congress decides to organize workers in resistance societies, trade unions.
The War of 1870 and the Commune only delayed the outcome of this opposition.
In France, the activists of the International actively participate in the Commune, and many of them are executed or sentenced to exile.
This federation is the true representation of the work, which must take place absolutely outside the political governments ".
The "Bakuninists", now called "Jura", will meet active sympathies in France, Spain and Belgium.
Attempts at conciliation within the French-speaking sections and then at the London Conference in 1871 will fail.
The London General Council then enjoined the Jura to merge into the approved federation of Geneva.
In the name of the statutory principle of autonomy, the Jura people refuse to have a single Swiss section of the International.
Due to the maintenance of their autonomous international structure, the Social Democratic Alliance, Bakunin and Guillaume are excluded.
Activists and federations stand in solidarity with the excluded and then leave the AIT.
At the Commune of Paris are joined the Commons of Saint-Etienne, Limoges, Narbonne, Marseille, Toulouse.
Quickly crushed by repression, these free Communes only briefly sketch the theory of the withering away of the state.
[...] for the anarchists, the failure of the Commune contains rich and valuable lessons.
Arrested after Bloody Week, she attended the executions and saw her comrades die, among whom was her friend Th√©ophile Ferr√©.

Power annihilated them, leaving them no more implacable will than for sacrifice.
It's because power is cursed, and that's why I'm anarchist. "
In France, it is from 1881 that the direct action is put forward and favored within the anarchist movement.
If we renounce solidarity through greed, then we fall into social hierarchy and despotism.
For this purpose, science must follow ethical foundations, not supernatural or economic principles.
Economic principles provide a solid foundation for making rational choices.

The Makhnovists are in favor of the model of "Soviets of Free Work" and opposed to the Bolshevik Soviets, controlled by the central power.
The popular song "Makhnovchtchina", written by √âtienne Roda-Gil and notably by the B√©rurier noir, pays tribute to this revolutionary movement.
Ernst Toller, a 25-year-old poet and playwright, takes the lead.
Although it relies largely on Marxist forces, it is easy to understand that it is more anarchist than Marxist.
He relies in particular on the anarchist theorist Gustav Landauer, whom he appoints Commissioner for Education and Culture.
Ernst Toller is put in prison, where he writes most of his books.
Revolutionary gradualism is a middle way between reformism and social revolution.
Its purpose is to end the "triple slavery of women: ignorance, capital and men".

In addition, they are sorry to see many of their fellow men frequent the brothels.
Note that the influence of libertarian ideas has always far exceeded the reality of the organized movement.
It is a theory of radical political ecology that opposes the current capitalist system of production and consumption.
It aims to establish a moral society, decentralized, united, guided by reason.
These proposals provoke extremely contrasting reactions within the libertarian movement.
On the economic level, he insists on the distinction between liberalism and capitalism.
The writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon on the property could serve as a basis for this construction.
It is also the result of radical atheism and the search for a post-Christian morality.
The motto of these men, organized into a republic, was "Generosity, Gratitude, Justice, Fidelity."
Theoretical roots are to be found in the writings of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier.
Some communities want to be true laboratories of utopia, others are shelters in times of repression or social crisis.
The essence of his method is the practice, the "real life", not the "dead letter".
This short experience, suppressed by the tsarist police inspires many pedagogues like C√©lestin Freinet or Alexander Sutherland Neill.

At the international level, the Communist Party is affiliated to the International Conferences of Communist and Workers' Parties.

That being so, it must be recognized that the treatment of mental disorders is far from foolproof.
Some hospitals are dedicated to short-term consultations or lower-risk patient therapies.
Patients can be admitted by force when they represent a danger for themselves or for those around them.
Patients were treated voluntarily with baths, medicine, music and other therapeutic activities.
Modern psychiatric hospitals have evolved since then, and eventually replaced psychiatric asylums in Europe.
The development of the modern psychiatric hospital also implies the evolution of institutional psychiatry.
It also implies a structural evolution of these economies, and so it is synonymous with time.
Until now, French psychiatric hospitals prohibited sexual relations between hospitalized patients.
Because sex is private, patients have the right to respect for their private lives.
The care is based on electroshock and diagnoses made by a fetishist doctor and murderer.
Lisa Mandel, described in a comic strip, "HP": "The insane asylum", the difficult daily life of a psychiatric hospital in the 1970s.
Melanie Hamilton-Wilkes is a fictional character appearing in Margaret Mitchell's novel "Gone With The Wind".
Melanie will marry Ashley Wilkes while Scarlett O'Hara, who covets the same man, will marry Melanie's brother Charles Hamilton.
This family has always valued the education of its members to provide the best possible.
As a result, they have acquired a good number of intellectuals and several well-known lawyers.
For many generations, they married members of the Wilkes family, with a spirit similar to theirs.
Unfortunately, these consanguineous unions have gradually resulted in the birth of stunted children.
Melanie and Charles's parents died when they were still children.
Neither were married and therefore considered their nephews as their own children.
Henry is a lawyer and resident of Atlanta, the family fortune is under his management.
The one who really raises the little ones is Uncle Peter, an African-American slave.
Peter is very loyal to Hamilton and has served Melanie and Charles's father during the Mexican-American War.
He is described as a brave and intelligent man who advises them often and occasionally makes decisions for them.
Keeping the family tradition, Melly announces her engagement with her cousin, Ashley Wilkes, in April 1861.
Nevertheless, she is present at the party, along with her family and many other plantation owners.
According to her description, Melanie is a delicate and petite young person with the size and weight of a child.
Its most notable feature can only be big black eyes in a heart-shaped face.
For Scarlett, she seems pretty shy and kind but not particularly pretty.
However, his movements are qualified as graceful and posed for his young age.
She seems more interested in discussing books than in flirting.
Ashley admits to being attracted to her but is determined to marry Melly.
In the confusion, she decides to grieve him by accepting the marriage proposal of Charles Hamilton, brother of Melanie.
Scarlett also thinks she is taking revenge on Melanie by marrying her brother.
Melly seems to have a penchant for Scarlett and welcomes him into his family.
Meanwhile, the Civil War is raging and Georgia is now part of the Confederate States of America.
Charles leaves two weeks after his marriage to enlist in Wade Hampton's army, known as the "Hampton Legion".
During her absence, Melanie accepts Aunt Pittypat's invitation to stay with her in Atlanta.
The fortune of the two women is still under the management of Uncle Henry.
His brother, less than two months after his engagement, having suffered, then cured of measles, dies of pneumonia.
His share of the family fortune is inherited by Scarlett, his widow.
This bad news is followed by the announcement of Scarlett's pregnancy.
Melanie's nephew is born at the end of the year and is called Wade Hampton Hamilton.
Melanie expresses the desire to know her "sister" better and to see her nephew.
Her mother is appalled and finally convinces her to accept the invitations.
She is welcomed by Uncle Peter, old but still determined to carry out his new task.
He leads her to the home of her aunt and sister-in-law.
Scarlett begins to think that her sister-in-law is braver than she looks.
Scarlett is always very interested in listening to her activities.
Melanie seems happy that Scarlett is showing much better company than their old aunt.
However, men capable of waging war remain inside the city, in the local militia.
Melly roughly criticizes their presence while several other warriors are asked on the field of honor.
Born into a respectable family in Charleston, Rhett was disinherited by his father after refusing to marry.
He left on his own and created his own fortune during the California Gold Rush of 1848-1849.
He has acquired wealth and success as a trader but has a terrible reputation.
Distinguished by his cynicism, we note that he gained wealth and fortune by this practice.
He seems to have an interest in befriending the two young women and then flirting with Scarlett.
In early 1863, Rhett established herself as a friend of the two women and often came to visit them.
For Melly, he seems to be a cold man needing a woman to comfort him.
On the other hand, Scarlett shares her cynical view of people and their ideals.
Melanie and she find that Rhett's aspirations are disturbing but intriguing.
Rhett's convictions often bring him enemies, but Melanie and Scarlett are not among them.
In the Middle East, the enemy of your enemy is still very often your enemy.
Belle has become well known in the city and respected by her "employees", but publicly, she is often isolated.
With the intention of contributing to the local hospital with some of his money, his offer is rejected.
The source of this sum is considered an insult to the heroic soldiers.
Meanwhile, Ashley serves in the Army of Northern Virginia and is promoted to the rank of Commander.
But the fate that has come to the soldiers remains uncertain.
Melanie and Scarlett have a personal interest in Ashley's fate, which they both love.
The first list of victims reaches Atlanta, Ashley is not there.
This is the first time Scarlett and Melanie have seen it in two years.
The soldier is greeted with joy and affection by the two women.
Ashley goes to meet Scarlett specifically to ask him to watch over Melly during his absence.
Melly had longed for a child and acted as a second mother for her nephew, Wade.
She is happy to have the chance to wait for her own child and announces the news to Scarlett.
But instead, Scarlett is surprised, confused and even angry to find Melanie pregnant with Ashley's child.
Melly is unable to understand Scarlett's reaction but is terrified of having, in one way or another, grieved her friend.
These reveal that the Melanie Basin is too narrow to allow the birth of the baby without any danger.
Melly sends a telegram to Ashley to announce the news.
Ashley's superior responds by explaining that her husband has been declared missing in the past three days.
Counting on the comfort of one for the other, Melanie and Scarlett are reconciled.
They spent the night crying in each other's arms in Scarlett's bed.
Anxious about the uncertain destiny of her husband, Melanie remains restless for a long time.
Scarlett could even hear, late at night, Melanie pacing in her room, obviously insomnia.
This custom degrades her health to the point that she sends people home, an unusual incident for her.
In exchange, Rhett asks Melly to swear to her that she will take some rest.
A month later, Rhett announces to Melanie and Scarlett what happened to Ashley.
He was wounded during the fight, captured and is in a prison camp in Rock Island, Illinois.
Their beloved is alive but is it still for a long time?
The rest died of smallpox, pneumonia and typhus among other deaths.
Melanie's pregnancy continues although her health is fragile.
She remained bedridden for most of her third trimester of maternity.
The troop of General William Tecumseh Sherman begins to approach Atlanta.
Meanwhile, Sherman begins his battle with the local guard.
Scarlett sends her servant, Prissy, to find help, but she is unable to get any for various reasons.
Scarlett and Prissy are forced to give birth to Melanie's baby without any experience.
After the birth of little Beauregard, Scarlett sends Prissy to get Rhett, needing his help to be able to save himself from Atlanta.
Scarlett, in fear and anger, convinces him to lead them to Tara.
Scarlett supports Tara where everyone asks for her help.
He makes it clear to Scarlett, but the latter burst into tears and accuses him of being mean.
A few weeks later, Melanie became a social model of Atlanta, known for her charity and immense kindness.
In short, it has become world famous and a model for other Arab media.
People love her, and she is president of the city's associations.
Amused by the general enthusiasm, they decide to isolate themselves and talk quietly about their moments together.
However, Archie and India surprise them, and immediately start the rumor of adultery.
Terrorized by Rhett and Melanie, Scarlett decides to hide at home and not go to the party.
It was without counting her husband, who forced her to go there.
However and against all odds, Melanie welcomes Scarlett with love, and does not believe a word of the rumor.
Melanie and Rhett continue to have a very good relationship, even when Rhett and Scarlett's marriage is out of control.
It is Melanie who, from all over the world, will convince Rhett - plunged into a sweet madness - to bury her child.
Some time later, Melanie gets pregnant a second time, despite Dr. Meade having vigorously warned her against it.
In fact, the birth of Beau- son's first son - having deeply tired him, he had told him that a second pregnancy would be fatal.
She loses a lot of strength, and on her deathbed, asks Scarlett who is traveling.
The latter, warned by Rhett, arrives on the spot and is desperate to see that Melanie is really going to die.
Melly tenderly tells her how much she loves Scarlett, who has always represented everything for her.
Scarlett is terribly helpless and realizes that she really loves Melanie, who has always supported her in all her choices.
For Scarlett, Melanie was better than a mother, and more than a sister.
Finally, Melly dies, and leaves him all the burden to take on his shoulders.
When she comforts Ashley, Scarlett has an illumination, and realizes she has not loved him for a long time.
He will be wounded there, while the helicopter in which he is hit by a Syrian missile.
Amos Gita√Ø now lives in Haifa and Paris, but works around the world.
Regulators around the world have worked hard to make the financial system safer.
In 2015, he produced nearly 90 works, of various natures and formats.
His first film "House" (1980) is a documentary dedicated to the reconstruction of a house.
The film is immediately banned in Israel, which marks the conflicting relationship of the filmmaker with the authorities of his country.
The evocation of this intimate and common experience served by an impressive plastic sense is exemplary of the art of Amos Gita√Ø.
The film also marks the beginning of the filmmaker's uninterrupted collaboration with screenwriter Marie-Jos√© Sanselme.
It happens that ten years separate two parts of a trilogy.
With "Tsili" (2014), adapted from a novel by Aharon Appelfeld, he returns to the Second World War and the Shoah:
In 2015, the work of the filmmaker Amos Gita√Ø has nearly 90 titles, made about 40 years.
We must add video installations, stage productions and books.
But the diversity of his works meets an extreme coherence.
Many integral retrospectives of his work have been shown around the world.
The county is divided into five districts: Oxford, Cherwell, Vale of White Horse, West Oxfordshire and South Oxfordshire.
The county has an important tourism economy and is known for Oxford University.
Les autres grandes villes sont Abingdon, Banbury, Bicester, Chinnor, Chipping Norton, Didcot, Faringdon, Henley-on-Thames, Kidlington, Thame, Wallingford, Wantage et Witney.
It is hoped that the extension in the future will be concentrated towards Banbury, Bicester, Didcot and Witney.
Oxfordshire is one of the richest regions of the European Union.
The European Union is today one of the richest economic regions on the planet.
Alfred the Great, the Anglo-Saxon king, was born in Wantage in 849.
The region has traditionally been an important country because of its fertile farmland and the prestigious city of Oxford.
The first railroad serving the county was the Great Western Railway, which reached the city of Didcot in 1839.
Saint-Julien-Vocance is a French commune, located in the department of Ardeche in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region.
Coming from Le Puy, St-Julien is a gateway to the community of Annonay.
The names of the parish are as follows: in 1152, Saint Julien de Lent.
Saint-Julien-Vocance is bordering 6 municipalities, 4 in the department of Ard√®che and 2 in the department of Haute-Loire.
For a long time, St-Julien remained a well populated town with 1200 inhabitants.
But the farmers who lived on agriculture and logging gradually gave up their activity.
This is reflected in the landscape by the disappearance of grasslands in favor of the forest.
There remains only one active farm in the town, the Col des Baraques, which preserves the open landscape.
Two sawmills maintain the forest activity, which can take advantage of 1900 hectares of fir forests.
Its fir stands and mid-mountain beech forests are considered as features to be protected as a "sensitive natural area".
The most imaginative make it the domain of the Afars, goblin pranks of Northern Ard√®che.
The permanent habitat has remained confined to the valley and now seems to stabilize around 250 inhabitants.
The village lost five of the six cafes it owned before.
But he now has a restaurant inn, made with the help of the municipality.
He also kept a post office, located at the town hall.
The forest surrounding the town is predominantly coniferous, fir and Douglas-fir being the majority, in northern exposure in particular.
The wood enjoys a renewed interest, but its price does not increase.
The number of companies has decreased, but the improvement of the equipment allowed to continue to work an identical volume.
The forest is gaining ground on abandoned land, and not all sectors are exploitable.
Its facades in good condition and its square bell tower dominate the village.
His style is generally novel, but the whole building does not seem excessively old.
For the choir, we know at least that it was added around 1888.
Facing the front door, the war memorial recalls the name of the 42 dead in the 14-18 war.
In any war, the focus is on the dead, the wounded and the displaced.
At the upstream exit of the village is a replica of the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes.
It hosts an outdoor mass every year on the evening of August 15th.
The longest reaches the farthest spring under the Baraques Pass.
On the way, thematic panels present the natural environment and in particular aquatic life and the place of water.
To avoid this ambiguity, the name "combustion turbine" should be preferred.
The theoretical yield increases with the compression ratio and the combustion temperature.
The combustion turbine is most often open cycle and internal combustion.
In this case, the cooling phase is external to the machine and is done by mixing in the atmosphere.
The combustion turbine can also be closed cycle and external combustion.
Heating and cooling are then provided by heat exchangers.
This more complex arrangement allows the use of particular gases or work with a low pressure different from the ambient.
The basic cycle described above can be improved by different complementary bodies:
This theoretical superiority over the Otto and Diesel cycles is, however, counterbalanced by the practical impossibility of carrying out the isothermal transformations.
In all cases, these devices are reserved for stationary installations because of the size and weight of the gas / gas exchangers.
The adjustment of the power is possible by acting on the flow of air input and on the injection of fuel.
This is for example the operating principle of the Rolls-Royce WR21 turbine.
Gas turbines with unit power ranging from a few kilowatts to several hundred megawatts are manufactured.
These discharges can also be reduced by injection of water or injection of steam into the combustion system.
The lack of pure water also reduces the chances of safe rehydration for people with diarrhea or fever.
The combustion turbine contributes to a large extent to current engines.
The compression phase is performed by an axial or centrifugal air compressor.
Compression work can be reduced by water spray on admission.
The steam is produced by a recovery boiler heated by the exhaust.
The injection of steam also makes it possible to limit the content of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust.
The turbine generally of axial type comprises one or more stages of relaxation.
Unlike steam turbines, they are still jet turbines.
Two main types of gas turbines are to be distinguished:
Single-shaft turbines are suitable for electrical production at steady state and higher load.
It requires the use of high-alloy steels (Cr-Ni-Va) and an energetic cooling by the charge air taken from the compressor.
The use of ceramic materials and single crystals have increased the temperature since the 2010s.
The advantages inherent to this type of machine are the following:
The applications of gas turbines derive directly from their specific advantages.
Naval propulsion also uses gas turbines, particularly for high-speed vessels (fast ferries, frigates, aircraft carriers).
On the other hand, the combustion turbine is poorly adapted to road vehicles.
The other major area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse for gas turbines is the production of electricity.
In single cycle, the yield is of the order of 30 to 35% or more for large machines.
The term turbocharger (commonly called "turbo" in the automotive field) has two meanings:
This device represents a significant improvement of the conventional engine in particular on the following points:
So this induces an additional supply of intake (air) gas without using any energy to the engine itself.
no-valid-translation
Even if these are reinjected into the turbine to improve the process and therefore the overall yield.
Turbojets and turboprops are gas turbines used in aeronautics to propel modern and fast aircraft.
The high-power combustion turbine (> 1 MW) is mainly used to drive an alternator and produce electricity.
The Lord Chancellor or Lord Chancellor is one of the most important posts of the British Government.
Some members held important positions in the Gaddafi government; others are social activists.
He is appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.
It is customary for him to be always a Lord, although there is no legal obstacle to the appointment of another person.
Before the union of Great Britain there were separate Lords-Chancellors for England and Scotland.
The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Cabinet, and is responsible for the proper functioning and independence of the courts.
The origin of the Office of the Lord Chancellor dates back to the Carolingian monarchy, in which a chancellor acted as guardian of the royal seal.
In England, the function dates at least from the Norman conquest of England in 1066.
Thus, the position has become one of the most important of the government.
It was only advanced in the government by the Lord Justiciar ("Lord Justiciar"), now obsolete.
As minister of the king, the Lord Chancellor attended the "Curia Regis" (King's Court).
The judicial duties of the Lord Chancellor have also evolved since the "Curia Regis".
Under the reign of Edward III, the chancery function was established in a separate tribunal for the Lord Chancellor.
The Lord Chancellor has also become known as the "keeper of the King's Conscience".
The guards were also appointed when the office of the Lord Chancellor was vacant, and removed from office when a replacement was found.
It was customary to appoint a commoner to the post of Lord Guardian, and a peer to that of the Lord Grand Chancellor.
A lord-guardian who acquired the title of peer was later named Lord Chancellor.
The last lord-keeper was, who was ennobled as baron in 1760 and named Lord-grand-Chancellor in 1761.
In the past there were separate offices of Lord Chancellor in England, Scotland and Ireland.
However, the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland continued to exist until the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922.
Thus, the Lord Chancellor remains the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, and the Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom.
The Lord Chancellor occupies many positions in the United Kingdom's legislative, executive, judicial and religious systems.
The Lord Chancellor was the presiding officer of the House of Lords by "time immemorial".
In this role, the Lord Chancellor wears a scarlet parliamentary woolen dress adorned with ermine fur.
He is wearing a tricorn hat, while the other lord-commissioner is wearing cocked hat.
In his place, the Lord-Speaker was appointed Lord Commissioner and took part in the ceremonies.
The lead role of the Lord Commissioner during this period has been taken over by the Leader of the House of Lords.
Nowadays, the ministry is headed by the Lord Chancellor, who is responsible for the administration of the courts.
The custody of the Great Seal of the Realm is entrusted to the Lord Chancellor.
In modern times these functions were exercised in moderation.
In many cases, however, the Lord Chancellor held the office of the Lord High Grandintendent temporarily.
Peer trials were abolished in 1948, and "impeachment" is now obsolete.
It is followed by a reception called the Lord Chancellor's Breakfast at Westminster.
According to the law, the Lord Chancellor must be consulted before the appointments that may be made in certain ecclesiastical tribunals.
He is, "ex officio", one of the 33 Church Commissioners who manage the assets of the Church of England.
The Lord Chancellor is also Keeper of the King's / Queen's Consciousness.
The power to appoint members of certain high schools, such as Harrow, Rugby and Charterhouse, is held by the Lord Chancellor.
Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid (GR) receptors of the cytoplasm of the cell.
This type of receptor is activated by a ligand type fixation.
They act by inhibition of genes encoding the following cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-Œ≥.
Decreased cytokine production results in reduced T-cell proliferation.
This decreases their activity and the clonal expansion of CD4 cells (T-helper lymphocytes).
Like T cells, B cells also express smaller amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors.
The clonal expansion of B lymphocytes is reduced and consequently the synthesis of immunoglobulins is decreased.
Glucocorticoids influence all types of inflammatory reactions, whatever their cause.
Phospholipase A2 is involved in the first stage of the production of several eicosanoids.
Expression of the genes encoding cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) is also diminished.
This enzyme catalyzes the following metabolic reactions in the production of prostaglandin and thromboxane inflammatory mediators.
By this mechanism, glucocorticoids successfully appease any sign of inflammation, however they can not prevent an infection.
There are many glucocorticoids currently used: cortisol, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisone, prednisolone among others.
More than 90% of them bind to different plasma proteins, however with different binding specificities.
The side effects of glucocorticoids appear only after prolonged anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy, and in high doses.
Cytostatics are drugs that inhibit cell division by damaging or destroying cells.
They are mainly used in the treatment of cancers, especially through chemotherapy.
However, they do not act only on cancer cells but also on all fast-dividing cells.
However, it is interesting to use them because cancer cells usually divide faster than normal cells.
B and T lymphocytes are also rapidly dividing cells.
This is why we can use cytostatic drugs when there is an inappropriate immune response.
These treatments are used at a lower dose when used for immunosuppressive purposes than in the treatment of cancers.
Their antiproliferative effects act on T and B lymphocytes together.
Because of their high efficiency, purine analogues are used most frequently.
The main representatives of this class are mustards (cyclophosphamide), nitrosureas, platinum salts (among others).
Their cytostatic effect is by direct interaction with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).
<br> Cyclophosphamide is certainly one of the most powerful immunosuppressive substances.
It inhibits the replication of DNA by making covalent bonds between the molecules.
In high doses there is a risk of pancytopenia and haemorrhagic cystitis.
(it works by binding to an enzyme- [dihydrofolate reductase] - and prevents the synthesis of a derivative of folic acid-tetrahydrofolate.
It is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and organ transplants.
It is widely used during organ transplants to control rejection reactions.
It works by inhibiting DNA synthesis by antagonizing purine bases.
Antibodies are used in the prevention of acute rejection because they provide rapid and profound immunosuppression.
Anti-lymphocyte Ab and anti-thymocyte Ab are used.
They are used in addition to other immunosuppressive therapies, to reduce their dosage and toxicity.
The most interesting are the antibodies directed against the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and CD3.
They are used in the prevention of rejection of transplanted organs, but also to destroy certain sub-lymphocyte populations.
New molecules of this type are expected in the future.
Ciclosporin and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibitors.
Cyclosporin has been used since 1984 and is one of the most used immunosuppressive therapies.
Calcineurin activates various transcription factors, which are used to transcribe IL-2 (interleukin 2).
IL-2 has a role of activation of helper T cells and leads to the production of other cytokines.
There is therefore activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes.
To act upstream of the production of IL-2 would have a role on the importance of the immune response.
Whatever the importance or the limitations of Mexico's role, this role was important.
It reaches the peak serum concentration three to four hours later.
The tissue concentration is four times higher than the plasma concentration.
In cells it interacts with a cytoplasmic protein of the immunophillin family, cyclophillin.
Cyclosporine is metabolised by the liver and excreted in the bile, its half-life is about 24 hours.
Mycophenolic acid is an active product formed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sodium mycophenolate, a new substance.
FTY120 is a new synthetic immunosuppressant, a chemical modification of the ISP-1 metabolite of the mushroom "Iscaria sincaliri".
It is a structural analogue of sphingosine that is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase in the cell.
As a result, it differs from all other known immunosuppressants.
Born in Dijon around 1320 at the hotel Aubriot, which belonged to his father, Guillaume Aubriot, lender and changer in Dijon.
On the death of his father he inherited a large fortune that he knew how to make fruit.
At the end of the year he is appointed bailiff of Dijon.
This hotel, called "Hotel Marmousets" because of its decoration, had belonged to Jean de Pacy, died in 1364.
He became the hotel of the provost at the place of Grand Ch√¢telet when Robert d'Estouteville bought it in 1454.
To ensure his power he said that his justice would not depend on the fortune of the litigant.
The justice of the distribution is supposed to be ensured by the justice of the exchanges.
Steward of finances and Provost of Paris under Charles V, he decorated Paris with several monuments.
He will put the provost of the merchants in dependence of the royal provost and is only consulted on secondary affairs.
As such, it implements important works in the city.
He built the Saint-Michel bridge and the Change bridge.
He also built, to meet the concern of the king to protect his capital, the small Ch√¢telet and the Bastille.
From 1370, he built, rue Montmartre, a vaulted and masonized sewer that joins the stream of M√©nilmontant.
Despite this victory, the conflict will not stop between the students and the provost.
It is the schism due to the election of two popes in 1378 that will give the opportunity to revive the conflict.
The death of King Charles V on September 16, 1380 made him lose his support and his protection.
The latter seeing his death arrive had wanted to reduce the taxes that supported the people and decided to abolish the fouages.
The people thought that the late King had suppressed all taxes.
He is replaced on May 17, 1381, provisionally by Guillaume de Saint-Germain as Provost of Paris.
The latter had previously been General Prosecutor in the Paris Parliament.
The "jerseys" seize the city and commit many excesses.
It is they who liberate Aubriot and who wished to put him at their head; but he refused this dangerous honor.
The pope invites him to retire to Sommi√®res where he died, a few months later, in 1382.
Hugues Aubriot's hotel, at 40 rue des Forges in Dijon, became the seat of the presidential election in 1739.
Completely restored in 1908 by architect Louis Perreau and sculptor Xavier Schanosky.
His statue adorning the facade of the Paris City Hall.
The term "race" has an uncertain etymology which complicates its meaning and makes its present use difficult.
Although there are no "human races", there is a "human plurality" without linked hierarchy.
In France, it tends to disappear from other sciences, anthropology, ethnology in favor of the predominantly cultural concept of ethnicity.
We will talk about geographical populations in biology, and differences between cultures for anthropology and ethnology.
The term "race" is sometimes used in everyday language to refer to "ethnic" or geographical or cultural groups.
The "Grand dictionnaire terminologique" of the Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise also offers several definitions.
These sensitive variations, once recognized, are interpreted by the system of values ‚Äã‚Äãspecific to each culture.
In "Racism explained to my daughter," Tahar Ben Jelloun wrote:
Medieval interpretations of the Old Testament divided men into sons of Ham, sons of Shem and sons of Japheth.
This point of view is then used to justify the black slave trade.
This article represents the first theoretical attempt to divide humanity into "races".
Moreover, he opposes two races in the French nation, the Gallo-Romans and the Franks.
The term "race" was used metaphorically to refer to specific populations.
Thus at Corneille writing future generations in the "Stances at Marquise":
So how do we prepare our children and future generations for such an evolution?
Gradually, other criteria appeared, with the emergence of physical anthropology, anthropometry, etc.
Natural science begins by establishing classifications for the purpose of listing and then comparing living things.
With Carl von Linn√©, appears for the first time, a classification with a "scientific" aim.
A 1887 history textbook, used in schools, begins:
Anthropology, by its observations and its mode of operation, proves incapable of determining the race.
Proponents of the classification of the human species as races sought a measuring instrument capable of giving criteria of differentiation.
They thus identified visible phenotypic characters, the first way to categorize the human species into different races.
This definition implies in a certain way the existence of a "racial purity", illustrated by "type" individuals.
The discipline fascinated those who were interested in the classification of "races" and who were convinced of their existence.
In the United States, the main classifications for scientific purposes were established by William Ripley and Carleton Coon.
Very significant variations are observed in the instructions given to the agents responsible for these "cuttings".
The great variability of physical traits prevents them from being attributed solely to a race.
This miscegenation, if it is sufficient to create intermediate forms, does not really invalidate the existence of human races as such.
For some authors, the existence of a gradual variation on the contrary validates the relevance of non-mixed forms.
Claude L√©vi-Strauss analyzes the mechanisms of the constitution of the racist ideology, in terms of differentiations of races:
Racism is precisely the opposite, making a cultural phenomenon an allegedly physical, natural and biological phenomenon.
He resumed his analyzes in a later and more detailed work, "Le Regard distant".
In particular, O. K. Obasogie emphasizes that "the distribution of genetic variations does not overlap with racial categories.
The future of our concepts of race and equality is at stake.
and consisted of an exchange of views between two American anthropologists, each defending his own.
The human species is therefore characterized by a very strong cultural dimension.
This is why the concept of ethnicity is nowadays preferred to that of race, in ethnology.
It has, from this point of view, the same function as biodiversity for other species.
Human diversity is therefore genetic, with its phenotypic but also cultural consequences.
And it is important to distinguish between the two domains, so as not to recreate, even involuntarily, racist and non-scientific discourses.
However, according to Jacques Ruffi√©, from the Coll√®ge de France, human groups have been converging for about six thousand years.
Modern man ("Homo sapiens") has experienced short periods of isolation of ethnic groups, but also many mixtures.
In humans, the impact of culture does not seem large enough to explain racial differentiation.
The cradle of "Homo sapiens" seems for the moment to have been Africa.
However, racialist theses can also coexist with monogenism, for example at Blumenbach.
The evolution of the genus "Homo" gave rise to the differentiation of several species.
It is therefore possible that during transition periods, different races, all members of the "Homo sapiens" group, coexisted.
Today, groups of people, geographically distant, present a fairly large variety of morphological, anatomical and physiological characters.
The study then leaves the field of simple biometrics to study the mechanisms governing the evolution of the human species.
Their conclusion is that racial self-identification is accurate enough to continue to be used in the medical setting.
In 2008, the journal "Science" published the most complete genomic study ever conducted.
The differences between men and monkeys are due to only a few dozen genes.
The apparent anatomical and physiological differences within the human species are due to an even smaller number of genes.
It is difficult, therefore, to isolate "standard" genes, differentiating various populations.
This finding led many biologists to consider that the notion of race is not biologically relevant.
Thus, the biological relevance of this notion is in particular questioned.
Since 2004, the human genome sequencing project has been completed.
It was this observation that led to the loss of interest in the racial classification of human beings.
For Feldman and his colleagues, there are three separate issues:
This will certainly tend to disappear with the significant mobility of human populations on the surface of the globe.
Thus, scientists have been able to demonstrate that it is possible to scientifically define groups within the human species.
This raises the problem of the relevance of such a racial classification.
Some have thus raised the idea that a racial classification could be advantageously integrated into medical practices.
However, the notion of "race" used here differs significantly from that of simple physical traits.
French legislation nevertheless continues to use the term "race", first by prohibiting racial discrimination.
The decree of 2 February 1990 authorized the registration of the racial origins of persons.
In 1983, the law on the rights and obligations of civil servants refers to ethnicity, not to race.
The Bible thus presents a form of symbolic monogenism, attributing the unique paternity of humanity to Adam and then to Noah.
The theme of a race distinct from humanity is often used in fiction.
In science fiction, it may be a new race that has emerged through the mechanisms of evolution.
He became Duke of Cracow, Silesia and Greater Poland in 1238.
From 1222, he began to assist his father and help him to unify Poland.
During the winter of 1233/1234, he participated in a crusade against the Prussians after which his father offered him Greater Poland.
After the death of his father in 1238, he became Duke of Krakow, Silesia and Greater Poland.
He inherited vast territories (Silesia, Little Poland, southern Greater Poland) on which he tries to consolidate his power.
At the level of domestic politics, he relies on the aristocracy to govern.
Domestic politics still has a great influence on a country's foreign policy.
The same year, he supports the Pope in the conflict between him and Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire.
In Greater Poland, he won some success against his rival Ladislas Odonic.
Extending the borders of its territory by seizing LƒÖd, Gniezno and ≈örem.
He takes steps with the pope to obtain the royal crown.
Henri II is here at the Battle of Legnica, which commands the Polish cabinet and the Templars against the Mongols.
His death is followed by the bursting of the territories that he and his father had tried to reunite.
The ducasse of Ath is a popular tradition of the city of Ath, in Hainaut, Belgium.
The primary purpose of these stories is undoubtedly religious education.
However, the organizers wanted to get their message across by entertaining the audience: the performance is also colorful and colorful.
These processional games were resumed and imitated from one city to another thanks to commercial exchanges.
Thus, the horse Bayard Ath takes over that of Oudenaarde most of its elements.
He built a square dungeon, the Burbant Tower, to protect the north of his county.
A second rampart enclosure is built and in 1393, begins the construction of the Saint-Julien church.
All enrich with their presence the procession which mixes religiously and profane.
Religious characters, like the mysteries, serve to catechize a largely illiterate population.
The secular representations bring the pleasure of the procession and attract the inhabitants of the surroundings.
It is in 1399 that the first mention of a procession is located.
The horse is copied to that of Oudenaarde where envoys went to learn about its construction and its handling.
Carried by a team of ten to twelve men, depending on the year, the Athois horse is huge.
Thirteen of the fifteen oldest giants of the former Netherlands, created at that time, are Goliath.
Indeed, the procession was then financed by the commune, the parish and the brotherhoods.
It is moreover probable that the chariot of the "triumphant Church", inspired by the Counter-Reformation, dates from this period.
Samson was introduced into the procession of the ducasse of Ath in 1679 as a giant of the brotherhood of gunners.
In the accounts of the massarderie of this year we read:
To them to make the Samson in posture to be paid 38 l.
The account also mentions the remuneration of the bearers of the giant and the "drum machine that was accompanied to the procession".
Did the procession disappear a few years ago during the War of Spanish Succession?
For the first time in fifteen years, it is again question of the procession of the dedication.
Express prohibition to allow any secular object; ceremonies and demonstrations in use the day before the fair are abolished.
He abandons the "way of the prudence" of the Popular Society, the mode of their annihilation.
The postures will be delivered to him so that it disposes of it to his will.
But we find different trades accompanied by their protector or their emblem.
On the other hand, Tirant is accompanied by archers and Samson gunners.
The first modification comes from the Dutch circulars of 1819:
Only the tourist and commercial interest justifies the maintenance of communal expenses for the ducasse.
But from this time, the organizers look for the unusual or the spectacular.
In 1820, Jacob's chariot was taken by forty children in Egyptian costume.
Scenes inspired by Cherubini's comic opera "Lodoiska" are depicted.
The "Char des Belles" is surrounded by hedges of barbarians.
It is followed by the effects of the 1848 crisis and cholera of 1849.
The resources of the city diminish as spending increases.
The transformations are considerable, they tend to make the procession a spectacle that will attract the public.
Indians, Scots, the Emperor of China with his mandarins and the Mamluks bring an exotic note.
A broad appeal is launched to the fancy societies and fanfares of the region.
The local chauvinism is expressed by the creation of the chariot of the city which carries the celebrities of the city.
We restore some religious groups: Saint John the Baptist, the Flight to Egypt or the chariot of the triumphant Church.
The giants are refurbished and obviously remain in place but Tirant changes its name.
Ambiorix expresses the concerns of a nationalist bourgeoisie who wants to give historical foundations to his country.
It is on this occasion that the Eagle will exhibit for the first time his two heads.
She participated only in one ducasse before being destroyed in 1794 with the other giants.
The head is the work of Ernest Ouverleaux, after a drawing by Henri Hanneton, director of the Academy of drawing of Ath.
In 1884, Monsieur and Madame Goliath had been dressed in blue for the ducasse procession.
The shoulder pads and the warrior's belt will be the colors "dear to most of his fellow citizens."
It is the same for the ribbon of the bodice, the edge of the jacket and sleeves of his wife.
The two giants wear a blue scarf and cockades in the same colors.
The head of the giant is surrounded by a wreath of blueberries and she holds a bouquet of the same flowers.
In the communal elections of 1932, the Socialists conquered the absolute majority.
The procession ends at the House of the People where David fights Goliath.
On this occasion, the wardrobe of the couple was renewed in the favorite color of the socialists.
They were then mobilized to serve the dominant political parties in the city.
They also changed the colors of their clothes to reflect the dominant political ideology.
At the end of the conflict, the procession of the Ducasse 1919 is reworked to celebrate the victory and will be released twice.
Ambiorix sees its historical vocation strengthened by a company of Eburons warriors, followed by the whole tribe.
A cart dragged by oxen transports old men and children.
He is followed by arquebusiers as well as gunners with their piece.
The Eagle is accompanied by crafts and corporations that recall the history of the city.
Only Goliath and his wife are not at the service of historical and patriotic innovations
During the second war, to compensate for the disappearance of public ceremonies, a small parade marched to the Royal Athenaeum in 1941.
Since then, each year, the "big bell" rings to commemorate the event.
In 1946, the procession was postponed for a week because of a storm.
As in the Middle Ages, it is a subscription that finances his resurrection by Ren√© Sansen.
At this time, the procession no longer seems to attract the attention of the Athois and is very neglected.
That is why, in 1971, under the initiative of the Circle of History and Archeology of Ath, a committee of renovation of the procession is created.
This one will take care of the good organization of the festivities by taking care exclusively of the figuration and its accessories.
The craze is so general that there are too many extras.
Saint Christophe returns to the procession in 1976 and the Diricq horses in 1981.
Goliath's first "burn of the mongrels" takes place on the Friday of the 1987 ducasse.
In 1993, the afternoon procession was interrupted by torrential rain.
It was necessary at all costs to preserve the costumes and the decoration of the tanks which nevertheless suffered heavy damage.
The 2004 Ducasse is marked by the Ghislenghien disaster, which occurred a few weeks earlier.
Only the "Vespers Gouyasse" and the Sunday processions are maintained.
In 2010, the group of "Bleus" regained its status as civic guard Athoise and not French guard.
We have also replaced the flag which will be more French but well athois.
The most recent of the giants of Ath is particularly honored.
This Mass of "dedication" gave the name of "ducasse" used to designate the current festivities.
In 2016, an ax of the Agricultural Tank broke, causing a delay during the morning procession.
Outside the fourth Sunday of August, the giants do not come out of their hangar.
Tirant a sans doute accompagn√© les archers athois √† Bruxelles in 1834.
The giants went out for princely or royal holidays in 1853 and 1854 in Ath.
Goliath and his wife participate in Brussels in the "Procession of giants and popular legends" of Easter Monday 1890.
They go out to Ath, but outside the ducasse, on the occasion of electoral victories in 1895, 1907 and 1933.
The communal authorities, the Athois of Brussels and the others were photographed with their "postures".
According to officials of the society that animates him, Bayard was to be considered as the "ambassador" of the city of Ath.
The bakers accompanied a swan, whose whiteness was reminiscent of flour.
In 1807, the twenty-three bakers of the city emit the wish to revive their beautiful bird.
A Scots tank represents a cave with a king and a queen.
Forty Athenians with blackened heads, with a ring in the nose are provided with bow and arrows.
It is actually a mix of Africans, Native Americans and India.
The origin of the ducasse of Ath is a procession of dedication, that is to say the commemoration of the patron saint of the parish.
The official calendar is set by the municipal administration in accordance with tradition.
About fifteen days before the procession, communal workers dusted and cleaned the tanks.
Dressings and alterations of the costumes of the extras take place at the Academy of Music.
The last week, groups of Blues, Halberbardiers and Men-at-Arms repeat their evolutions.
The city is washed down and fairgrounders settle on the Grand-Place and the quai Saint-Jacques.
The giant then roams the streets of downtown and dances to the sound of a small band formed for the occasion.
In each family we prepare the traditional "we will eat the next day in the late afternoon.
They will then take place in front of the church where the "Vespers Gouyasse" take place.
This one is solemnized by the athone choir "Rencontre" or a choir friend.
Then, the procession returns to the Grand Place to the sound of frenzied tunes with hugging embraces of the newlyweds.
The game-party is broken down into two elements: a dialogue and a fight.
From generation to generation, it has been transmitted by word of mouth carrier.
It is published for the first time by Emmanuel Fourdin in 1869.
The concert ends with an anthology of tunes and ducasse songs.
At the end of the procession, a fervent crowd accompanies the giants to the communal shed.
A tribute is paid to the firefighters victims of the Ghislenghien Catastrophe.
Every five years since 1981, a rondeau brings together all the giants on Place Ernest Cambier.
In the afternoon, various activities are scheduled on the Esplanade, including an archery competition.
The fanfare of Moulbaix parade on the plain before a balloon festival.
On Friday, a night market brings together local and outdoor traders in the city center.
On the Saturday and Sunday following the ducasse, at the theater "le Palace", the troupe of
"Matelots de la Dendre" (active in Ath since 1853) presents their traditional operetta gala.
In 2013, they play "Waltzes of Vienna", an operetta with great show on a music of Johann Strauss, father and son.
But the highlight is the traditional mussel dinner (see below: ducasse traditions).
If in the Crown of Fourdin, you should confess to hear the march, accompanied by his lords, from his torches and from his lords.
As for the "stories" and characters, they are interposed between the various trades.
Finally, the City's chariot, built in 1715, is adorned with feathers, strainers and other golden attributes.
The Emperor occupies him, clad in an ermine-clad garment and high-pitched children.
As for the groups, the Escape in Egypt is the medieval figuration.
No one knows, except their presence, attested by a single document.
We do not know everything about their accessories, their weight, their size.
Allies: equestrian group in uniform of the nations of the Entente and carrying banners.
The present procession follows an immutable order, fixed by tradition.
Volunteers firefighters (present in the procession since 1885) parade in mind.
Follows the Eagle with two heads, accompanied by the fanfare of Meslin-l'Eveque.
The Saint-Christophe de Flobecq, mounted on stilts, is attested since 1462.
Indeed, this one, accompanied by the Royal Union of the Fanfares Sainte C√©cile de Moulbaix, was created only in 1679.
Then comes the group of the Canon of Mount Sarah, which evokes the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
This decorative float was created in 1850 under the name of "Young Women's Tank".
Devoted to Venus in 1851, he later became the chariot of Flore (1860) and Horticulture (1876).
In 1850, he metamorphoses into Ambiorix to evoke local and national history while keeping his bow and arrows.
The Hallebardiers are watching this part of the courtesy of their manuscripts.
He reminds the Athois of the reign of Archdukes Albert and Isabella.
It is to them that we owe the construction of the Town Hall from 1614.
Sixteen bearers make him dance to the sound of the Huissignies fanfare.
From 1876 until at least 1885, a tank from Belgium circulated in the procession.
The Nine Provinces float was designed by the Brussels decorator Govaert in 1880.
A goddess, representing Belgium, is surrounded by nine young ladies wearing the coat of arms of each province of the country.
The goddess of the city sits in a monopoly temple above the personalities who have illustrated the history of the city.
The Goliath Guard (Magnon, Leafmen and Diricq Horses) is a kind of burlesque order service.
They are the ones who make them dance to the sounds of the fanfares that accompany them.
The first bearers of giants were probably workers in the Estaques mill, who were used to collecting heavy sacks of wheat.
Formerly, the status of giant carrier was reserved for traditional families, still very present today.
From three porters per giant before 1934, there were six in the late 1960s.
Since then, the movement has accelerated to form groups of about ten men.
The horse Bayard (six hundred kilos), meanwhile, has two teams of 16 carriers who animate it.
Originally, they were members of a local gymnastics society.
Gradually, outsiders joined the different groups.
The little shepherd David is related to the giant Goliath's carrier family.
In Ath, the devils appear in processions of the Ancien R√©gime.
Wild men (leafmen) walked in a few processions and held a role in springtime games.
Always appearing in the procession and the game of St Evermare to Russon, they remain, in Mons, the allies of the dragon.
However, the program of 1809, to which he refers, does not take them back.
The character is nicknamed "Magnon" since 1858, sobriquet of the contemporary.
Magnon is armed with a pork bladder which he uses to push the crowd back when the giants pass.
This transvestite is prepared by the wild man or his wife.
It is a delicate work, each sheet being sewn by hand, which requires about fifteen hours.
If they stop, the club high, it is very rare that they let it fall on the head of a recalcitrant.
This is the opposite of Magnon, whose sound bites are not counted.
Diricq being an old Athois surname, they are probably named after their first builder or rider.
They often shine with their picturesque character and ensure their role for decades.
This is the case of the "Wild" on the Barque des P√™cheurs Neapolitan.
Present since 1873 at least, it would have been embarked on the legendary island of Gavatao.
He is one of the spectacular elements of the procession by his jokes and cries.
Young people from the Patro de Flobecq, Enghien and then Ath invested themselves in figuration on the tanks.
From that moment, the craze for the party grew steadily.
This group is now well integrated into the Sunday procession and also scrolls with torches on Saturday evening.
The association "Renovation of the Procession" was born in this context.
She played a vital role in the revalorization and revitalization of the festivities.
Since then, the Global Fund has played a vital role in stopping the spread of these epidemics.
A thought that has played a vital role in the development of the European institutions.
Each giant dances to the sounds of a fanfare of his own.
Foals are integrated into the procession to accustom them to the noise and the crowd.
Archival footage shows us tanks sometimes abandoned by their extras or surrounded by a scattered public.
The same year, for lack of horses, the tank of navigation remains in the hangar.
A living dog sits on one of the chariot horses of the city.
The assembly and dressing begin a few days before the party.
Four people, two editors, a dresser and a hairdresser, are responsible for this mission formerly surrounded by "secrets".
We first place the bust on the basket before balancing the whole thing.
The horse Bayard remains, with the tanks, with the communal shed, zoning of the Primrose until Sunday morning.
It is unpacked, cleaned and brings some small restorations of fabrics or paint.
This is a fairly recent tradition, which appeared in the 1980s.
The florists have made it a product of ducasse, adopted by the population.
The "8 of September", we eat mussels in cafes, restaurants and association seats.
In a state of intoxication, he began to distribute the mussels on the Grand-Place.
This custom can be compared to the traditional dish of Lille's stock market, which takes place on the first weekend of September.
During the festive season, we taste the "" or "Gouyasse pie".
The origin of this pie is lost in the mists of history.
Archery, a traditional sport, has always been part of ceremonies.
The brotherhoods of archers (San Sebastian, St. Nicholas and St. Christine) participated under the Ancien Regime in defense of the city.
The bourgmestre's shooting is still taking place on Friday as part of the ducasse.
Prices are placed on a harrow that is hoisted up a mast.
The ball game is with archery, the most practiced sport during the ducasse.
At that time, teams were not formed, but grouped players by neighborhood or village.
Renowned teams compete against it before an informed and passionate public.
A luminous balloon was dropped after the ball of the "Philharmonic Society of Ath" (created in 1783).
Around 1850, when the festival became communal, the authorities took charge of it.
The official poster of the Communal Feasts of 1905 informs for the first time a "great aerostatic party".
In 1989, the party turns into a balloon festival, more spectacular and better appreciated by the public.
From 1835, the municipal administration organizes, as part of the ducasse, games to celebrate the Days of September.
These festivals are intended to recall "the deliverance of the city from the Dutch yoke".
In 2004, it is canceled in tribute to firefighters disappeared in the Ghislenghien disaster.
This nomination was related to the giants and processional dragons of Western Europe.
With the Ducasse de Mons, she joins the Carnival of Binche among the walloon events listed.
During the year, a museum about giants (called "House of Giants") is open to the public.
The local football club is called the "Royal Giant Athois" and evolves in the "Stadium Giants".
"Chronology based on data from articles on each civilization (October 2012)"
Over the millennia, arrivals have spread to North America and South America.
The exact date on which the first population group emigrated to America is the subject of much debate.
Migration time models are currently divided into two general approaches.
"See detailed articles: North-Amerindians, Native Americans in the United States and Mississippian civilization"
These groups moved from one place to another when usual resources were exhausted or when they sought new sources of supply.
Paleoindian groups were efficient hunters and used a wide variety of tools.
These include more or less specialized high-performance instruments for cutting meat and treating skins.
The climate of North America finally stabilized around the year 8000 BC.
BC, climatic conditions becoming very similar to those of today.
For thousands of years, Native American peoples have domesticated and cultivated a wide range of plant species.
These species now make up 50-60% of all cultures worldwide.
Many then formed new tribes or confederations in response to European colonization.
This list, not exhaustive, recapitulates the main cultures or civilizations and their geographical location in Central or North America.
"Mesoamerican" is the adjective generally used to refer to this group of pre-Columbian cultures.
Between 1800 and 300 BCE, complex cultures began to emerge in Mesoamerica.
However, in the absence of draft animals, the wheel was used only as a toy.
They also used copper and native gold in metallurgy.
The arithmetic system has been one of the most complex in the world, with a base 20 numbering system.
The largest Mesoamerican cities such as Teotihuacan, Mexico-Tenochtitlan and Cholula were among the largest in the world.
They consolidated their power and spread their influence in trade, art, politics, technology and theology.
Many have made war with them, but almost all peoples have found themselves in these five spheres of influence.
This civilization established the cultural pattern that would inspire all successive indigenous civilizations in Mexico.
The Olmec civilization began with an abundance of pottery production, around 2300 BC.
Olmec influence has spread throughout Mexico, Central America, and the Gulf of Mexico.
The decline of the Olmecs led to a power vacuum in Mexico.
Emerging from this void emerged Teotihuacan, whose origin dates back to 300 BCE.
Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order that had never existed in Mexico.
We must imagine a new world economic order that better reflects the changing realities of our time.
In the city of Teotihuacan lived a diverse and cosmopolitan population.
Most of Mexico's regional ethnicities have been represented in the city, such as the Zapotec people in the Oaxaca region.
They lived in community houses where they practiced their trades and contributed to the economic and cultural growth of the city.
Around 500 AD, Teotihuacan had become the largest city in the world.
The economic development of Teotihuacan touched areas of northern Mexico.
The period between 250 and 650 AD was a time of intense flourishing of the achievements of the Mayan civilization.
With the decline of the Toltec civilization appeared a political fragmentation in the valley of Mexico.
In this new political game the pretenders to the Toltec throne found rivals outside: the Mexicas.
The modern name of "Mexico" comes from the name of their people.
Their capital, Mexico-Tenochtitlan, is the site of Mexico's modern capital, Mexico City.
The market created was the largest ever seen by the Conquistadors when they arrived.
This non-exhaustive list summarizes the main cultures or civilizations and their geographical location in South America.
Among these groups were the Chibchas (or "Muiscas" or "Muyscas"), the Valdivias and the Taironas.
Direct archaeological evidence of such pre-Columbian contacts and such transport is however lacking.
This place is considered one of the six places where civilization was born independently in the world.
Norte Chico is the oldest known civilization in America and lasted until about 1800 BC.
The Valdivia culture was concentrated on the coast of Ecuador.
Its existence has been discovered recently as a result of archaeological discoveries.
Their culture is the oldest of the Americas, extending over a period stretching from 3500 to 1800 BCE.
The people of Valdivia lived in community houses built in a circle or oval around a central square.
The arrival of the populations of the seventies is the livelihood of agriculture and of the p√™che, well that would have come to the point of chasser le cerf.
Ca√±aris were natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces known as Ca√±ar and Azuay.
They constituted a complex civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs.
The Incas destroyed and burned most of their remains.
The city has also been considered as the site of Eldorado, the golden city of Colombian mythology.
The majority of them did not mix with the settlers or crossbred.
The civilization of Chav√≠n lasted from 900 to 300 BC.
The areas they occupied in Colombia corresponded to the current departments of Santander (north and south), Boyac√° and Cundinamarca.
It was here that the first farms and the first industries developed.
The Chibchas developed the most populated area between the Inca Empire and the Maya area.
In the Eastern Andes, the Chibchas were composed of several tribes who spoke the same language (Chibchan).
They were the following: Muisca, Guane, Lache, A'i Cof√°n, and Chitarero.
The heritage of the Moche culture is manifested by elaborate burials.
Some have recently been brought to light by Christopher Donnan of UCLA in association with the National Geographic Society.
They had contacts with distant peoples, like the Mayas.
The Larco Museum in Lima, Peru has an extensive collection of such ceramics.
The cities were built with precision, of unequal-sized stone, assembled on several levels of mountainous terrain.
There is evidence of the existence of efficient metallurgy and even effective neurosurgery in the Inca civilization.
More than two-thirds of all types of food crops in the world are from the Americas.
The natives started using fire in a generalized way.
This technique could be at the origin of the savannas of North America pre-Columbian.
As long as I have heard that in other regions of the world (Asia, Africa, Europe), the Amerindians are also an issue.
The guinea pig was also bred for meat in the Andes.
The iguana was also a source of meat in Mexico, as well as in central and northern South America.
Potatoes were used by the Incas, and chocolate by the Aztecs.
The haplogroup most commonly associated with Native Americans is haplogroup Q (Y-DNA).
As a consequence, the historical evolution of mutations can be easily studied.
If the place is inhabited since Prehistory, the first city, named Lugdunum, dates from ancient Rome.
Under the Roman Empire, Lyon became a powerful city, capital of Roman Gaul.
Then the division of the Carolingian Empire places it in position of border city.
In the Renaissance, Lyon developed considerably and became a major European trading city.
But this second golden age is mowed down by the wars of religion, which make some of the foreign merchant bankers flee definitively.
During the absolute monarchy, Lyon remains a middle city in France, whose main wealth is the work of silk.
The Revolution devastates the city, which opposes in 1793 to the Convention.
Taken militarily, it is severely repressed and comes out of the very weakened revolutionary turmoil.
This is the starting point for an economic and industrial boom which, despite some fluctuations, lasted until the First World War.
Jean Moulin, in particular, unifies them within the United Movements of the Resistance.
Endowed with powerful industries and a booming tertiary sector, the city holds its rank of great French and European metropolis.
Many objects dating, for the oldest, of the Mesolithic, were found on the site of Vaise.
Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of large Gallic gatherings and the existence of an emporium.
It serves as a place of exchange between the Romans and the S√©gusiaves and √âduens peoples.
Created by the will of Rome, Lugdunum devient, thanks to its strategic position, the capital of Gauls.
Important political, religious and commercial center, the city develops considerably, becoming a cosmopolitan city.
In the case of Lugdunum, it would be a question of monitoring the Allobroges.
Before the foundation, the confluence between the Rhone and Saone has a physiognomy very different from the present one.
There is no certainty about the origin of the settlers and their social position.
Specialists suggest that it comes partly from the colony of Vienna, and partly from the legions of Munatius Plancus.
The colony is not solidly fortified, just she has lifting of land and palisades of wood.
The inhabitants are Roman citizens, those of free birth are ranked in the Galeria tribe, the freedmen in the Palatina tribe.
The term Dunum means in Celtic language a height, a hill or a citadel.
However, archaeologists have not found traces of worship on the spot, but in Condate or Vaise.
It would then be possible to bring lug closer to the root "lux", meaning "light".
Located on a strategic point, the colony quickly became the capital of Gaul by the will of Augustus.
Lugdunum is ideally located and a network of roads is quickly drawn from the city.
Thanks to its location and influence, the city is growing and growing rapidly.
At the same time, the altar of the federal sanctuary of the three Gauls is renovated.
Beyond the prestigious monuments, it is all the urban cores of the agglomeration that develops.
It administers itself, but no text on the municipal laws remains.
On the other hand, the many Latin inscriptions (over three thousand) provide information on its inhabitants and their functions.
The Lyons institutions have two groups: the magistrates and the senate.
Magistrates are organized in three degrees: questure, edility and duovirat.
The Questeurs are responsible for raising municipal funds, under the supervision of duumvirs.
The city halls are devolved to the maintenance of roads, baths, markets, public buildings, food.
They also take care of the electoral operations or the convocation of the council of decurions.
As the capital of the Three Gauls, Lugdunum has several important political and spiritual attributes.
It is the only Roman city with Carthage to have an urban cohort.
The priesthood of the federal cult is the highest administrative burden to which Gallic Roman citizens can claim in Gaul.
It is held in Lyon, in a temple of which there are no archaeological traces.
People are named among them to form the council of the Three Gauls.
Endowed with substantial financial resources, his role is poorly known, but was to serve as a relay between the Gallic elite and the emperors.
The following year, they themselves are victims of a disaster and Nero sends them the same amount to rebuild the city.
This fire, known only by a text of Seneca and Tacitus, has never been corroborated by archaeological evidence.
During this conflict, the Viennese besiege Lyon, but must leave the field of the fight after the defeat of Vindex.
However, Galba, the new and brief emperor, punishes the Lyonnais for their support for Nero.
We have the trace thanks to the taurobolic altar found in 1704.
After the death of Emperor Commodus, the civil war sees several contenders at the head of the Roman Empire.
Septimius Severus, however, knew Lugdunum well, having been legate there, and his two sons Caracalla and Geta were born there.
It is during this episode also that the imperial monetary workshop is closed.
The crisis of the third century, however, does not seem to have affected the city itself, which has not been invaded.
In particular, there are no traces of Lyonnais action during the Gallic Empire.
The hill of Fourvi√®re is abandoned, the inhabitants regrouping on the right bank of the Saone.
Trade flows follow other paths and the city is no longer linked to major events.
There is, moreover, no more trace of activity of the council of the Three Gauls.
A revolt of Lyonnais against Aurelian in 274 has unknown causes, but does not prevent the emperor to restore the imperial monetary workshop.
Shortly afterwards, in 281, Proculus, rich owner Lyonnais, proclaims himself emperor against Probus.
In 383, the young emperor Gratien was assassinated in Lyon on the orders of Maxime.
Unlike others, the imperial cult here seems to have a distinctly superior importance to other forms of worship.
Now, these foreigners bring with them their worship, such as those of Mithra, Isis or Cybele.
The first Christians are therefore of Eastern origin, including Phrygia, as a part of the population of the city.
Many characters appear, including the first bishop of Lyon, Pothin.
Christians flee persecution by taking refuge on Barbe Island.
The true master of the city, from this time, becomes the archbishop.
Few, they are quickly assimilated by the Gallo-Roman nobility of Lyon, through many marriages.
Arians, they build a cathedral dedicated to their worship, but maintain good relations with other Christians.
Lyon is most frequently in possession of the King of Neustria.
The later period, during the Frankish domination, is very poorly known.
In these troubled times, the ecclesiastical institutions palliate the disappearance of the imperial administration.
Many bishops are from the Gallo-Roman nobility, which for a long time preserves an ancient culture.
The influence of the Bishop of Lyon is very strong in the region, and he maintains a positive aura in Christendom.
He is called "patriarch" at the council of M√¢con of 585.
He has authority over the dioceses of Autun, M√¢con, Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne and Langres.
Other examples of this influence are perceptible with the sending of an embassy in Spain headed by Arigius (602-614?
), or the consecration of a bishop of Canterbury to Lyon by Goduinus (688-701?).
The few Lyonnais who have transmitted to us a remarkable work are Sidoine Apollinaire, Eucher or Viventiole.
Eucher writes many books on the Christian faith, and letters.
Finally, from Viventiole we have a "Life of the Fathers of the Jura", which describes the beginnings of monasticism in the region.
After the treaty of Verdun and the succession of Charlemagne, the city is officially divided.
The right bank of the Saone returns to Charles the Bald, the peninsula to Lothaire.
After the short Carolingian period, a veil of shade, caused by the scarcity of available sources, obscures again the history of Lyon.
During this period, Lyon hardly evolves topographically compared to previous centuries.
There are also islands of inhabitants around Saint-Just and Saint-Ir√©n√©e, on the hill of Fourvi√®re, as well as on the peninsula.
Without documentation, it is impossible to quantify the population at this time.
If the limits of the city do not move, it is transformed.
Thus, Leidrade creates two schools to raise the intellectual and moral level of the clerics of the city.
These two schools are a success and establish the intellectual bases of the city for the following centuries.
The creation of chapters of canons had to change the balance of the population.
Some even allow themselves to be part of the great conflicts of their time.
Faithful to the ideals of Charlemagne, he participated in the revolt of the sons of Emperor Louis the Pious against their father.
Aur√©lien figures in the forefront of those who conferred the monarchy on Duke Boson during the assembly of Mantaille in 879.
These political events take place in a climate of insecurity linked to numerous invasions.
Ultimately, this period sees the archbishops remain largely independent of a royal power far or weakened.
Even if the documentary sources do not make it possible to establish clearly the modalities of this domination, it seems without dispute.
This changes in the next century, with the advent of powerful dynasties of local counts.
Lyon, in the heart of the Middle Ages, is a largely independent city dominated by local ecclesiastical forces.
Developing slowly, it is marked by intellectual and institutional immobilism.
During these two centuries, Lyon hardly grows up, but remodels and modifies itself.
For its defense and as part of its urban growth, Lyon acquires several equipment during this period.
After the assaults of the Counts of Forez in 1162, Guichard Pontigny establishes a rampart around the canonical district of Saint-Jean.
This religious group is then called the "Great Cloister".
It is completed under Archbishop Humbert in 1070 and allows the development of the peninsula.
Many religious constructions also appear in the Rhone capital at that time.
But in the field of ecclesiastical architecture, the majority of open sites are renovations or transformations.
Many buildings threaten ruin, are no longer suitable or are the object of a desire for embellishment.
In these places, the population that settles is large enough to impose the creation of two new parishes.
The powers of police and justice are entirely in the hands of the archbishop.
He, and the various Lyonnais chapters, possess the whole of the soil of the city, which belongs to the direct.
Thus, the archbishop has land in the Monts d'Or and between the valleys of Br√©venne and Gier.
The canons of Ainay are well supplied in the lower valley of Azergues, and in the immediate south-east of Lyon.
Finally, the chapter of Barbe Island develops its strongholds in the southern Dombes, Forez and Dr√¥me.
However, this distinction remains very theoretical, it does not grant legal or institutional powers.
Thus, during a century, no Lyons archbishop decided to include it in his titulature.
The counts take advantage of moments of weakening of the institution or prelates, such as the old age of Burchard II in the 1020s.
In 1076, an agreement was signed during the plaid of Tassin between the archbishop Humbert and the count Artaud II.
Excited, in 1162, the Count de Forez took Lyon, pushing Heraclius to flight.
The bulk of market trading is limited to local products, bought and sold by Lyonnais.
On the contrary, the main chapters reinforce their organization and their uses, continuing their enrichment.
Two other establishments, more recent and less influential, resume their common life and ideal of poverty.
Symptomatically, they come from the will of the two reforming prelates that Lyon knew about this period.
The first, Notre-Dame de la Plati√®re, is imposed by G√©buin, on the peninsula.
This immobility Lyons in the religious field is also reflected in the stagnation of intellectual centers in the city.
The libraries of churches or cathedrals are meager, only one bishop bequeaths manuscripts to the cathedral during the two centuries.
About 1170-1173, Vaud√®s gets rid of his fortune by endowing his wife and daughters, and gives the rest to the poor.
Then he begins to preach in the streets begging his bread.
Disciples are joining him little by little and clergy are complaining about him.
When they return, they resume their sermons, attracting the enmity of many canons, and particularly those of the cathedral chapter.
The date of 1320 is clearly a tipping over for the history of the city.
This is seen in several indirect indices, the written sources do not allow to quantify the phenomenon.
In the first place, the extension of the urban structure goes far beyond the necessities of a simple natural increase of the inhabitants of the city.
Urban income per capita is more than three times the average of rural areas.
In addition, the number of hospitals increases sharply from five to twelve during the century.
Many agricultural lands are built, providing them with much higher incomes.
The left bank of the Rhone, meanwhile, does not yet enjoy any urban development, except for a few isolated points.
The largest construction site in the city is the construction of Saint John's Cathedral.
This economy is highly dependent on the waterways, used as much as possible.
The action of churchmen on economic development is also seen in the modification of agricultural systems.
Then, the left bank of the Rhone specializes in breeding, including the country of Velin.
The big business makes episodic attempts to establish itself in Lyon.
The circulation of long-distance traders who spend most of their time in the east is only slightly modified.
It is at the price of the independence of the city, which passes under the bosom of the king of France.
The zone of political influence of the lords of Lyons, that is to say, the archbishop and the canons-counts of Saint-Jean, who govern jointly, is restricted.
They have few strongholds far from the county of Lyonnais itself.
This century is a period of prosperity for the ecclesiastical lords of Lyon.
They use their fortune and the difficulties of the nobles to round off their possessions.
They methodically improve the administration of their property, from a fiscal, military and judicial point of view.
To preserve their domination, the canons are gradually closing access to the main institutions, the chapters of Saint-Jean and Saint-Just.
Only composed of bourgeois, it is dominated by a dozen families, present until the end of the Middle Ages.
These bourgeois are merchants, mainly clothiers and furriers, and men of law.
They practice money trading on different scales, lending mainly to clergy and religious institutions.
They live in solid houses, but can not own them, the soil being wholly owned by traditional chapters.
They are concentrated mainly in two districts: Saint-Paul and Saint-Nizier.
The history of obtaining their consulate extends throughout the century, and can be separated into several stages.
An agreement between the bourgeois and the archbishop is signed in 1193.
But two years later, the inhabitants and the bourgeois revolt, protesting against new abuses.
Renaud reacts brutally, but fails to bring calm.
He must appeal to the Duke of Burgundy Eudes III, who manages to subdue the bourgeois.
He referees by imposing on Renaud the respect of the charters previously granted.
The Lyons power is also coveted by the noble families of the cathedral chapter.
The crisis between the three parties breaks out between 1267 and 1274.
Following the arrest by their men of a bourgeois in 1269, the Lyonnais react violently.
This violence is as much the fault of the people as of the bourgeois, united in societies of fraternal solidarity.
A truce is concluded in June 1269, but the situation is still explosive.
He must, on the other hand, recognize himself as vassal of the King of France.
This is the first serious crack at Lyon's independence.
The first took the city under his care in the 1280s, blocking some episcopal decisions.
From the 1290s, it is the king who takes the hand.
The archbishops, little in agreement with their cathedral chapter, can not rely on him for their parish ministry.
On the other hand, most of the prelates of this period have a short reign, preventing any spiritual continuity.
The canons are above all lords managers of their obedience.
The oath of entry to the cathedral chapter mentions no spiritual obligation, but the preservation of the property of the community.
Their only concrete action is the traditional assistance to the poor and the liturgical service of the cathedral.
They are well received by the archbishops and often benefit from their testament liberality.
The Cordeliers settled in the merchant center of Lyon, near the banks of the Rhone in 1220.
They are followed in 1304 by the Poor Clares and in 1319 by the Augustinians.
Even if their actions are poorly known, it is possible to assume that they strongly influence the development of Lyon's confraternal movement.
These moments, however, do not allow the city to take a particular religious rise.
The first council of Lyon is convened in 1245 by Pope Innocent IV.
The Second Council of Lyon was convened in 1274 by Pope Gregory X.
In 1316, it is still a royal decision that imposes the site of Lyon for the election and the coronation of John XXII.
South of the plateau is the cloister of Saint-Just; in the center, that of Saint-Thomas-de-Fourvi√®re.
The city on the right bank of the Saone is dense and grouped near the river.
The slopes of the hill and its feet are mostly covered with vineyards and orchards.
The houses are built very close to the water, so there is no place for a towpath.
This district is, to the south, dominated by the cloister of the Saint-Jean cathedral.
Its size cuts the city in two, partially isolating the southern and northern neighborhoods.
Beyond, the city stops at the gate of Bourgneuf, the loop of the river.
Then there is the district of Pierre-Scize, dominated by the castle of the archbishop.
On the peninsula, urbanization is heterogeneous, with areas of fields, orchards, vineyards, interspersed with poles lotis.
The enclosure protects from Ainay south to the foot of the slopes of the San Sebastian coast, the current Croix-Rousse.
The population density is impossible to estimate, as the burrows of the archbishop's palace have disappeared.
In many places, the religious or civil buildings are rebuilt, the rise of the Lyon mendicant orders being for many.
Thus, the north bell tower, completed in 1460, becomes the belfry of the city.
The center of this village is located around the Saint-Nizier church, where the primitive urban nucleus developed.
Similar to the Saint-Paul district, it includes food trades, a hall and noble crafts (draperies, etc.).
North of this area, the slope of San Sebasti√°n is empty of inhabitants, only traversed by vineyards and ruins.
At its feet, five gates symbolically mark the limits of the city, the defensive wall being built back.
The work is then entrusted to the Cistercians of Hautecombe, then to those of the abbey of Chassagne in Dombes.
The year 1320 is also an important milestone for the city of Lyon in demographic terms.
Indeed, it is at this date that was established the first document allowing to have an order of magnitude of the population.
This places Lyon in the rank of secondary metropolis, such as Arles or Avignon.
The first wave of plague, the "black death", strikes Lyon in May 1348.
Between one third and half of the population disappears during this summer.
In 1800, it accounted for half of the world's population and half of its economy.
Lyon was never looted or even besieged at that time.
The militia of the city almost never had to fight the looters who circulated at this troubled time.
The Lyonnais have however to suffer the devastation in the vicinity, devastating the fields and properties of many notables.
The two most troubled periods are between 1358 and 1368, as well as between 1417 and 1444.
At the time of the census of 1388, nearly half of these possess property outside the city.
During this period, Lyon does not shine by a particularly developed craft.
There is no notable export industry, with the Lyon productions only destined for the near region.
The professions of money changers or innkeepers (often very closely linked) are the only ones to benefit from Lyon's strategic position.
The fairs, granted by the Dauphin on February 9, 1420, do not know a great activity for decades.
The Saturday market is the main animation moment of the week.
The poorest sections of society live on a small piece of land.
These two social groups being largely in the majority, a bad season and it is the whole city which weakens.
Thus, the years 1347-1362 are a very difficult period for Lyon.
The study of tax documents makes it possible to highlight a very strong disparity between social categories.
The beginning of prosperity of the city thus slightly erased the inequalities.
She has money, a solid urban heritage and seigneuries.
This group discusses the equal with the nobility, even if there are not many unions between the two.
Under this small elite are the merchants, still few at this time.
Mobile, with varying and changing fortunes, they try to accumulate capital to progress in the social hierarchy to the elite.
Finally, the mass of Lyon are "affaneurs", people who live by punctual work, gleaned here and there.
Lyon concentrates a large number of jurisdictions, archiepiscopal, capitular, seigniorial, royal.
This drains significant financial flows, sufficient to support more than a hundred diverse people (graduates, prosecutors, clerks, sergeants ...).
The number of notaries is plethoric for a city of this size (70 in 1377 and 87 in 1446).
The archbishop heads the officiality, which has expertise in very broad areas: guardianship, curatorship, matrimonial and testamentary affairs.
Four other courts-a sword, a cloister, a common court, a court of excesses-with vague outlines, are added to ecclesiastical influence.
But the few successes obtained do not stop the evolution towards the royal domination on all the important judicial cases.
This charter institutionalizes a consulate that manages the affairs of the city.
However, the mode of election confirms the constitution of an oligarchic group that will often be out of step with shifting social realities.
If many elected officials are regularly absent, two permanent members are present: the receiver-secretary and the receiver.
They send out a lot of little things, roads, alms, and so on.
They take care of the adjudication of the farms, the holding of the tax, at its return.
They allow the city to establish its finances, and, past periods of conflict, to make multiple civilian expenses.
As for other cities, it is during periods of crisis that the consulate forges a common history and welds.
From the 1360s, the region began to suffer the repercussions of the Franco-British wars.
The marauding gangs of soldiers (the "late-comers", in particular) circulate and plunder the Lyonnais.
They triumphed in 1362 in Brignais an army rushed in all haste.
Passages of military convoys are less ferocious than in other places, but they are regular until the 1390s.
The second period of persistent insecurity is between 1417 and 1445.
The last major business of the consulate is to meet the food needs of the city.
This fidelity is not entirely shared by the population; however, no pro-Burgundy uprisings take place.
But nothing supports the rumors that run periodically, saying that some are preparing an uprising.
This position in favor of the King of France is explained by three elements.
In the first place, the king is the one who imposed the charter of the city on local ecclesiastical forces.
Then, the merchants Lyonnais do not frequent much more the fairs of Champagne, in full decline, but rather go to Geneva.
Finally, at this time, the grain supply of the population can do without Burgundy land.
On two occasions, in 1376-1390 and in 1418-1436, periods of unlawful opposition forced the consuls to provide care to the citizens.
For a long time, the archbishop opposed the royal forces on the exercise of justice on the Lyons lands.
He simply showed the consuls that the people were still following the archbishop when the tax pressure was too high.
The judgment of the parliament is broken the following year, and the officers come back in force in town.
The following year, the parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies dispersed.
Immediately, the people growls and a general assembly meets to protest the tax.
The consulate, opposite, explains that it can not shirk the royal will and must pay well.
The tension, probably strong, does not lead to any confrontation between rich and modest.
A compromise is found between the consuls and the masters of the trades, to make pay relatively equitably everyone.
The movement ends with a late submission of the Lyon population.
This ends with the submission to the king, who comes at the end of the year with his army.
It is a landmark for the city which, some time later, enters the Renaissance.
Lyon, at the end of the Middle Ages, no longer has the prestige of previous centuries allowing it to attract popes and councils.
The archbishops of Lyon, since the pivotal year of 1320, have lost much of their judicial and political power.
Despite their efforts to recover and preserve what remains, their influence is slowly nibbling.
The first is in charge of all that pertains to the concrete and spiritual administration.
Similarly, donations for charitable works are less directly intended to help the needy than to make the institutions work.
It thus prepares the arrival of the Renaissance, in Lyon as elsewhere.
The Lyon of the Renaissance is a city that fills up, but whose general morphology evolves little.
The slopes of the current Croix-Rousse, sparsely populated, become denser at this time, as the left bank of the Rhone.
On the peninsula, several cemeteries of convents or churches are transformed into place (Jacobins, Celestins).
The area that will later be Place Bellecour is a military site that will be several times converted.
From the demographic trough of the years 1430-1440, the population of Lyon progresses regularly.
This increase is mainly due to immigration, from Savoy, Dauphin√© and Burgundy.
Quickly, the usual production basins are no longer sufficient, demanding ever larger imports from Burgundy.
This is one of the causes of the "Great Rebeyne" in 1529.
This industry, which is a major element in the history of the Rhone economy, made its appearance in Lyon during the Renaissance.
After negotiation Louis XI renounced and brought the workers to Tours, at the expense of the Lyons bourgeois.
The last thirty years of the century are very difficult for Lyon silk, which is experiencing a first severe crisis.
During the last twenty years of the twentieth century, however, an intellectual revolution took place.
Driven by the fairs, the printing industry is growing rapidly in Lyon, to dominate with Paris the French market.
These printers feed an international trade, destined for France, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and Italy.
Fran√ßois Rabelais thus publishes in Lyon several works including the first collection of stories of Gargantua.
One of the most famous printers is S√©bastien Gryphe, from Swabia.
Very sharp in his achievements, he produces more than a thousand editions.
√âtienne Dolet is trained in publishing in his studio, before setting up his own.
With the Catholic victory of the end of the century, the printers converted to the Reformation, like the Tournes, emigrated to Geneva.
This domination of European finance collapses in the 1560s.
There are 75 Italian banks in 1568, 21 in 1597.
Lyon's finance is not recovering from these problems and is once again becoming a second-rate financial center.
The Lyon renaissance has fewer fears related to wars than in previous decades.
There are some warnings, but the region does not suffer from European wars.
They grant him and constantly confirm the holding of their fairs.
The court of Charles VIII settles there when the king goes to the peninsula.
This is the moment when the Lyons School of Poetry is born.
After the defeats of Protestant forces, the city became a stronghold of the Holy League, until the mid-1590s.
The first strands of the reform arrived in the 1520s, worn by printers from Germany and Geneva.
In response, Fran√ßois de Rohan organized a provincial council in 1528, which took various measures to counter deviations.
The first solid stone for the implementation of the reform in Lyon was, in 1546, the foundation of the first reformed Lyon temple.
Determined minority, she holds the city by force, supported by the Baron des Adrets.
This situation lasts until June 15, 1563, when a compromise returns the keys of the city to the official forces.
This opposition to the king is above all religious, and becomes political only with the arrival of Henry IV, Protestant.
The Lyonnais league movement is therefore important until the 1590s.
When Henry IV converted to Catholicism in July 1593, the city gradually turned into the other camp.
With the end of the century end the troubles that shook the city of Lyon for over fifty years.
Orders for pious books fall, while at the same time the competition of secular works, of humanist spirit or already reformers.
The development of the movement throughout Lyon's society took place only in the 1550s.
All layers of society are affected by conversions, in proportions that are impossible to evaluate.
Only the Lyonnais of Italian origin stay away from this movement.
The Catholic restoration is finally completed by Archbishop Pierre D'√âpinac (1574-1599).
The city of Lyon, under the last two centuries of the Ancien R√©gime, undergoes several important transformations.
no-valid-translation
With the population of Lyon increasing, many neighborhoods have their homes raised, most often by destruction and reconstruction.
For the same reason, the few areas still fallow are built.
Led by Jacques-Germain Soufflot and his pupils Musset and Milanois, he is devolved to the bourgeoisie.
Finally, a last is launched by Jean-Antoine Morand in the last decades of the century to create a neighborhood Brotteaux.
Moreover, during these two centuries, a large number of monuments are built in Lyon, both religious and lay.
The latter also traces the plans of the H√¥tel-Dieu, a theater in the Saint-Clair district or the first opera of the city.
This shows the still vital importance for the city of the right bank of the Saone.
Construction, food and clothing dominate and make the majority of the population work.
Lyon is a city in perpetual transformation, and the building trades rarely know the crisis.
Food trades are present throughout the city, except butchers, who are concentrated in defined neighborhoods.
In 1655, a Silky Lyonnais, Octavio Mey, invents the silk luster, which increases the gloss of the fabric.
Silk is gradually becoming the engine of the Lyon economy, requiring a large workforce and, in part, highly qualified.
In a non-oil economy, labor is the main driver of wealth.
Lyon remains during the two centuries a great city of publishing and printing.
And it remains to demonstrate that the great powers of this century will live up to this role.
The big business and the bank are in Lyon a powerful and dynamic elite.
The Lyon authorities are committed to maintaining, and even developing when possible, the tax privileges for this profession.
The domination of Lyon by different social groups evolves over time.
She sees them giving way, to the consulate and key posts, to the silky masters.
The political life of Lyon is profoundly transformed by the Chauny edict of 1595, imposed by Henry IV.
They have profoundly transformed the German political landscape and it is clear who are the winners and the losers.
This reform results in a consulate of only four aldermen, presided over by a provost of the merchants.
The governor has the function of representing the king, and directs the local military forces.
He has the power to break an election, if he thinks that it would bring to the municipal power an indocile person.
However, it is indeed the consulate that manages the daily Rhone.
This chandelier is staged many times, especially during the royal entrances.
Present at the best places during religious processions, during national festivities, its members preside over all local festivals.
The construction of the sumptuous town hall, Place des Terreaux, is part of this desire for glorification.
The entrance to the consulate automatically confers the nobility, many tax exemptions and important emoluments.
But his most important decisions are still targeted by royal agents, and likely to be refused.
This shift of the elite is accompanied by a pronounced social segregation, neighborhoods becoming exclusively bourgeois, around Terreaux and Bellecour, mainly.
The two centuries of absolutism see social unrest continuing.
Some emotions are classic frumentary movements, such as the movements of the year 1653.
Virtually every novelty in this area leads to scuffles or looting.
In the face of these revolts, the consulate is in an uncomfortable position.
He must both protest his loyalty to the king, and try to maintain legitimacy against the Lyonnais.
He succeeds less and less, and imposes himself more and more by force.
Indeed, the world of the Grande Fabrique is growing and changing.
A new type of conflict is developing, within a large enough group to create a full-fledged society.
Solidarity is established, with common threats (crisis of demand, lower tariffs) and a common job.
This policy finds its acme with the appointment of Richelieu's own brother, Alphonse-Louis du Plessis de Richelieu, in 1628.
They pursue a policy of support for royal power and religious reconquest of the entire population.
Ultimately, the efforts made to build in the city and its surroundings a strong and framed faith.
Recruitment, in all areas of religious life, is slowly drying up.
The number of vocations of priests and religious, both male and female, is considerably reduced.
In the same way, secular associations are disappearing from the public landscape of Lyons, no longer organizing, for example, large popular demonstrations of piety.
Another symbol of the relaxation of religious consciousness, a Jewish community resettled in the city in the 1780s.
During this period, Jansenist currents, badly fought, reappear without their being imposed.
An academy was founded in 1700 and its members animate the intellectual life of the city.
The notables lyonnais are enlightened amateurs of paintings, medals, and books.
As for the classical arts, taught and practiced, they are not represented in Lyon by major personalities.
The two outstanding artists of the modern era are Thomas Blanchet, painter, and Jacques-Germain Soufflot, architect.
With the Enlightenment, Lyon knows, like all major European cities, a Masonic profusion.
The sources are missing to date precisely the first Masonic lodges Lyon, which can be estimated to appear around the 1730s.
This lodge participates greatly (Willermoz, in particular) in the reconstruction of the Grand Orient of France.
At his side, other non-regular lodges open, of trend and of varied origin.
In Lyon, the revolt of the canuts of 1786 prepared in an original way the revolutionary jolts.
Brutally repressed, it allowed the silk workers to structure themselves, and especially to do so in secret.
Popular elements regroup, publish leaflets to mobilize the population, circulate petitions.
In parallel, Lyon's elites are awakened to politics, in an intellectual climate conducive to reforms.
From that time, coteries were formed, prefiguring the political parties of the Revolution.
On March 14, 1789, the first meeting of the three orders took place at the Cordeliers church.
At the moment, they dominate people who want to avoid upsetting the established order.
But on July 14, Pierre Scize's castle is taken.
During the Great Fear, looting takes place against noble houses or bourgeois owners.
To restore order, a draft National Guard was established in Lyon.
These groups are led by Marie Joseph Chalier who maintains and develops an atmosphere of protest, and always more revolutionary.
The plan slowly climbed during the year 1790, but it was stale and failed.
The years 1789, 1790 and 1791 are bad for crops and the economy.
The news of the king's flight triggers many unrest, mostly rural.
This one is suspended in December 1791 following a conflict with Chalier; Lyon sinks into revolutionary troubles.
The apogee of this radicalization intervenes during the elections of November 1792, when Chalier and several mountaineers are elected to the town hall.
Still in the minority, they spread violent propaganda in an attempt to rally the people to their views, to no avail.
On February 18, 1793, a new election brings Antoine Nivi√®re-Chol to the post of mayor, always with a majority of moderates.
Finally free to act at will, they multiply the extreme decisions and are very quickly very unpopular.
They are overthrown as early as May 29, 1793 by a coup de force of the Girondins.
The Lyon authorities, despite threats of a clash with Paris, remain faithful to their line of conduct.
Trials condemn Chalier and several of his friends, himself being executed on July 16, 1793.
Given the failure of his first attempts, Kellermann decides to bomb the city to undermine the morale of the inhabitants.
The shelling began on the night of 22 to 23 August to stop only with the surrender of Lyon.
For many months, the Terror falls on Lyon and the revolutionary festivals do not mobilize or convince traumatized populations.
So the government appointed at the head of Lyon a tried Republican, Paul Cayre.
For two years, until 1797, a latent conflict between Republicans and Counterrevolutionaries was held throughout the city.
Deeply divided, it does not unify around parties and official projects.
The population frequents clubs and theaters, where rivalries express themselves openly and sharpen.
The monarchist forces managed, in 1797, to bring to the Council of Five Hundred Jacques Imbert-Colom√®s and Camille Jordan.
They also try to counter the monarchist libels, without succeeding.
In conclusion, the Lyonnais are in their majority not fervent monarchists.
They no longer trust the Parisian authorities, and especially want to find peace and prosperity.
This division is accentuated by the definitive refusal of the archbishop of the civil constitution of the clergy and oaths.
In the years 1791-93, a large number of priests remained in the fold of the constitutional church.
During this period, however, the two clergy coexisted properly, the exile measures against the refractory being applied very loosely.
Everything changes with Lyon's opposition to the Convention and the siege of the city in 1793.
Fallen at the hands of the most ardent Lyonnais revolutionaries, anti-religious measures multiply.
Throughout the Revolution, a hidden cult survives and develops, massively supported by the population, especially in the countryside.
Between them, they secretly reorganize the refractory clergy, maintaining a close and regular correspondence with the archbishop who remained in Italy.
At the end of the revolutionary period, religious indifference or hostility towards the Church seems to have progressed markedly.
Very divided, the two clergy do not get close easily, Marbeuf and Linsolas refusing any conciliation with the constitutional ones.
Between the takeover of Bonaparte and the collapse of the Second Empire, Lyon experienced a considerable evolution.
It was under the Second Empire that most of the urban renovations took place.
From 1800 to 1870, political life was tightly controlled, and expressed only in limited contexts.
The press, like all clubs and societies of notables, is monitored.
Opinions are crystallized by the elections, which, even if censoring, punctuate Lyon's life.
The people, totally excluded from the political space, are widely crossed by republican or Bonapartist ideals.
Lyon enters the Monarchy of July shaken by two strong revolts of the canuts, in 1831 and 1834.
These two revolts are repressed in the blood and Lyon, strictly supervised, remains politically calm until 1848.
Legitimists, very much in the minority, take refuge in the defense of religion and the rights of the Church.
The workers' troubles are few, contrary to what the authorities and bourgeois elites fear.
The Republican masses can not rise to the announcement of the coup d'√©tat of 1851, the city being squared by the army.
In March 1853, Claude-Marius Vaisse, who remains eleven years and transforms the center of the city, is placed in this post.
Thus, during those of 1857, Jacques-Louis H√©non is reelected as Republican candidate.
The slow liberalization of the Empire allows many newspapers to flourish in Lyon, representing all political trends.
At the beginning of 1870, a national congress was organized at the Brotteaux, and a project of Lyon workers' federation was mounted.
The declaration of war against Prussia does not provoke patriotic flights, and the first defeats quickly provoke republican movements.
During the years 1800-1870, Lyon found an important place in the national economy.
Most of this is achieved with its traditional silk business.
Nevertheless, other industries are gradually taking its place alongside it, as well as a very active banking sector.
Leaving the Revolution, Lyon is a devastated and ruined city.
The workbook, poorly adapted to the world of the Fabrique, is diverted to summarize the relationship between weaver and merchant.
A purely Lyon creation also immediately finds its utility: the tribunal des prud'hommes.
The masters of the Fabrique completely control the outlets of the production.
Before 1815, most bristles were sold on the continent, in all the courts of Europe.
Second, the sharp rise in tariff barriers is shifting sales channels to the United Kingdom and the United States.
The world of silk entrepreneurs is expanding steadily with the expansion of business, doubling in the first half of the century.
Subsequently, the number stagnates, which means that on average, the wealth of each one increases.
At the same time, a certain concentration takes place, putting in the hands of an elite the essential means of production.
In 1855, the thirteen leading companies supply 43% of the woven silk in Lyon.
These most powerful houses have the funds to invest in mechanical machines, standardizing the products made.
The growth of the transport network is the most salient index of industrial transformation in Lyon.
Throughout the period, many transport companies, often very profitable, operate waterways and railways.
The establishment of the Jacquard loom marks the beginning of a culture of complex mechanical systems.
It became the first public limited company in Lyon in 1821, and the first French steel company in the middle of the century.
Technical education was born in Lyon very early, with the foundation in 1826 of the school of Martini√®re.
This school trains qualified staff in factories where the staff is already well educated.
But the need for technicians increasing, in 1857 is created a Central School Lyonnaise and in 1872 a business school.
Throughout the period, it is difficult to separate bankers from investors, traders or industry leaders.
It was not until the 1860s that the freely open bank, with counters and numerous branches, arrived in Lyon.
It was at this time, in 1863, that Cr√©dit Lyonnais was born, founded by Arl√®s-Dufour and Henri Germain.
Lyon, at the end of the Revolution, does not know too much religious detachment, unlike many surrounding countryside.
As early as 1805, the new religious authorities under the direction of Joseph Fesch solved most of the material problems of priests.
With a focus on training, he creates six small seminars and renovates higher ecclesiastical schools.
Thus, in 1851, circles close to carbonari and voracious set up burials without a priest, civil baptisms.
At the same time, a strong Jewish community is taking shape.
Until the 1840s, the works of assistance multiply well, but remain too traditional to take root strongly in the popular mass.
Above all, distrust of new ideas, socialist for example, diminishes their effectiveness.
A last institution, still more innovative, tries to bring the word of God to the working world: the Prado.
Founded by Abbe Antoine Chevrier, she opened a school of catechism at La Guilloti√®re, which later became a minor seminary.
Propagated in the Masonic lodges, these ideas are spread widely in the elites of the city.
This school is characterized by a search for unity between the experimental sciences, the sciences of the human spirit and authentic Catholicism.
The best-known propagators of this thought are Andre-Marie Ampere and Pierre-Simon Ballanche.
This school flourishes in Lyon in most cultural institutions including the Museum of Fine Arts.
The Lyons school stands out in the 1830s with a movement inspired by the mystical and illuminist currents of Lyon.
We thus find themes close to Freemasonry, especially in works by Louis Janmot.
This group also represented by Victor Orsel or Hippolyte Flandrin is close to the British Pre-Raphaelites.
It is inspired mainly by philosophical, moral and religious themes, drawing in the Nazarene movement and influenced by Ingres.
This trend ends with Puvis de Chavannes and pre-impressionists such as Joseph Guichard, Fran√ßois-Auguste Ravier and Fran√ßois Vernay.
Marked by her successive mayors, she sees her population increase and her industry prosper.
Under the new republican regime, the municipality of Lyon undertakes many works to develop the city.
Major projects are born under the mandate of Antoine Gailleton, and are pursued by his successors.
Thus, he begins the renovation of the Grol√©e district, the construction of several bridges, and especially the Faculties.
Finally, on the left bank of the Rhone, it is under his direction that the palace of the prefecture is built.
It is at the same time that the basilica of Fourvi√®re is built.
Mayor Edouard Herriot (1905-1957) did a lot of urban planning work.
Other projects were born under the influence of the architect Tony Garnier, in strong collusion with the mayor.
Note that all these sites are completed in the interwar period.
The Gerland stadium is completed, but does not host the 1924 Olympic Games that eventually fell in Paris.
From the first moments after the fall of the Empire, Lyon expresses its radical political culture, that is to say fiercely republican and socially moderate.
She keeps this trait until the end of the Third Republic.
They form a committee of public safety which proclaims the Republic in Lyon.
It is composed of radical republicans, socialists, anarchists, some militants of the International.
An insurrectional movement then tries to seize power to prepare the defense of the city.
The city is experiencing troubles again, following the Paris Commune.
Louis Andrieux, Attorney General of the city, brings calm to the price of a severe repression.
The Lyon municipal authorities are fighting to repeal the 1873 law, and are gradually winning their case.
In 1881, the central town hall was restored, but the mayor was still appointed by the government.
During the first decades of the Third Republic, Lyon firmly rooted its attachment to radicalism.
The real strength of moderate or radical Republicans is the electoral committees.
Present in every neighborhood, they are the driving force behind Lyon's political life before the emergence of structured political parties.
He undertakes to improve public hygiene, he creates many municipal schools, and is at the origin of the first tram lines.
He also founded the Faculty of Medicine and renovated some neighborhoods like Grol√©e, Saint-Paul and Mulati√®re.
On June 25, 1894, President Sadi Carnot was assassinated by Sante Geronimo Caserio.
In 1900, Antoine Gailleton was beaten by the socialist Victor Augagneur.
Very authoritarian, he intends to lead all the institutions of Lyon, at the risk of rushing the people who manage them.
It thus conflicts with the hospices civils or the job exchange.
This mayor quickly imposes himself as a charismatic mayor, perfectly and long in line with the people of Lyon.
During the First World War, Lyon participated in the war effort by hosting a large number of wounded.
Civil society is mobilizing to provide injured care and supplies.
The period 1890-1930 is very homogeneous for Lyon in economic terms, despite some inflections.
The 1870s and especially 1880s are marked in Lyon by major economic difficulties.
Lyon emerged from these difficulties from the end of the 1880s by focusing on new sectors of activity.
Four sectors of activity are the main actors of this effervescence: electricity, mechanics, chemistry and textiles.
These industrial changes have a strong impact on the traditional world of the Lyon silk factory.
The global crisis of the 1930s strongly hits the city of Rhone, and especially the textile.
But all old industries are seriously affected by the restriction of markets, especially the steel sectors.
The Third Republic is a moment of intense conflict in Lyon between Catholic militants and anticlericals.

The following titles can be awarded by Yang di-Pertuan Agong, only to Malaysian citizens.
The limit on the number of possessors excludes honorary awards granted to foreigners, who may use these titles locally.
It limits the number of energy sources that can usefully be connected to global power grids.
The number of "Tun" is limited to 25 live supporters at the same time.
"Tan Sri" is the second title in the order and is limited to 75 living followers.
The titles of "Datuk" have been conferred by the federal government since 1965 and are limited to about 200 people.
Its Dutch-language equivalent is EHSAL at the Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel (HUB), currently Odisee.
Located in Brussels, ICHEC has two locations (Montgomery and Manoir d'Anjou).
ICHEC is associated with the Leuven School of Management group of the Louvain University Academy.
In 2006 they launched an "International MBA" and a doctoral school in management.
ICHEC has also signed about fifty bilateral agreements with universities and schools around the world.
Since 2008, China has signed 23 bilateral swap agreements, including one with South Korea.
ICHEC is also a member of the international conference of Francophone HECs and the European Business Council (EBC).
Tychy is an important industrial center of automobile production (the Fiat 500 in particular).
Industrial production is forty times larger than it was at the beginning of the twentieth century.
It is also the place of production of Tyskie beer.
The city is the capital of Tychy Powiat and Tychy County Powiat.
The city borders Katowice in the north, Miko≈Ç√≥w in the west, Bieru≈Ñ Stary in the east and Kobi√≥r in the south.
A second specimen, also of undefined sex, was discovered before 1913 in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta by Carriker.
It is assumed that the Carriker specimen is from a gift or purchase.
This specimen was recorded in 1913 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Subsequently, despite several organized searches, no other rodent of this species is observed.
The coat, which is very soft or almost woolly, is supplied and long.
Mystic and genital vibrisses, up to five centimeters long, are thin and relatively short.
The upper surface of the front and back legs is covered with a light gray tawny coat.
The feet do not have small tubercles between the foot pads and the pollux is covered by a fingernail.
The supraorbital edges of the skull are considerably developed and the interorbital region is very broad with almost parallel edges.
This rodent has large eyes, which is consistent with its nocturnal behavior.
It also has two pairs of lateral udders on the abdominal border of the lateral coat, at the ventral pelage.
This rodent is able to climb easily to a vertical wooden surface.
When he was rediscovered in 2011, he showed no vocal activity during the two observations.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers in 1996 that it is a "vulnerable species" (VU).
Following a reassessment in 2011, it is finally categorized as "Critically Endangered" (CR).
Thus, Paul Salaman indicates that a large part of the forest that constitutes the potential area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe species has been cleared or degraded.
Finally, the impacts of climate change could be a long-term threat.
It is also to be feared that climate change will be an additional threat to the lives of the poor.
Physical size ‚Üí Sensor ‚Üí Conditioning and signal processing ‚Üí Operation.
The sensor will transform a physical quantity into a signal (most often electrical) exploitable.
There are two main families of sensors: passive and active.
However, we must also compensate the effect of influential quantities (example: take into account the Earth's magnetic field for a magnetometer).
Parliament will now have to take into account the opposition's proposals.
The direction of this change will have to take into account the approaches favored by the different parties.
Finally, it will be necessary to upgrade and filter the signal to be able to exploit it (example: anti-aliasing filter before an analog-digital converter).
The implementation of the conditioner makes extensive use of analog electronics.
If the sensor is resistive (the physical quantity changes a resistance value), we can use a resistor bridge.
It will usually amplify the signal with a simple amplifier or an instrumentation amplifier depending on the case.
Finally, we must design the system that will make the signal useful.
We can then create a virtual instrument (with LabVIEW for example) that can display the size and save it on the disk.
It can also be an LED or needle (analog) display.
These are prohibited for sale in France and Belgium.
It aims, for example, to capture the largest, or the largest number of possible catches in a limited time.
It usually requires more or less sophisticated equipment, experience, good physical condition and patience.
Sport fishing is sometimes supervised by federations that organize competitions.
Freshwater fishing consists of four main types of fishing.
The groundfish, or dead line, or bottom line is to present a fish bait on the bottom.
The catch fishery is a technique that involves attracting fish to a specific place called shot.
It can only be practiced on rivers of the second and third category (slow river, river), canals, ponds.
The target fish species are white fish: bleaks, roach, bream, carp, tench, rudd, barbel.
This fishing is sporty and many competitions are held in many countries both nationally and internationally.
It takes many years of perseverance to start getting results.
The baits used vary according to the season, the altitude and the state of the water.
There is a specific material but can be chosen in relation to the size of the river that one wishes to prospect.
An English cane is sometimes the case for this mode of fishing.
This fishing owes its name to the tape made most of the time by the trout catching the bait!
Bleaks jump over the water and flee in all directions.
Patience is de rigueur and is often successful.
For this reason some fishermen bring in a bucket a few roaches that will serve as bait.
To throw, there are mainly two techniques: the whipped pitch and the crossbow throwing (several names).
The principle of throwing a crossbow is to shoot the body of the fly until folding the cane.
The power of the cane will do the rest when you release the fly.
(Crossbows are used mainly with ball nymphs.)
Fly fishing comes in different categories:
Fly fishing allows you to catch all types of fish in a variety of environments (freshwater, salt water).
The first description of p√™che √† la mouche description is found in the "Natura Animalium", where Claude √âlien (200 ap.
The species sought are mainly carnivorous including pikes, perch, perch, but also black bass and catfish.
(It is possible to search for salmonids such as trout and "casting" salmon.)
We can distinguish three types of casting, differing in particular by the weight of the lures used:
These are often cheap lures, so you can buy different ones.
Various types of large spoons are often used for big pike.
By their sizes, shapes or colors, they are adapted to the species, to the luminosity, to the type of stream.
Black is used when you see the bottom of the stream.
The rotation of the spoon produces vibrations in the water similar to the flapping wings of a fly escaping from the water.
Thus the "game" of the reel is crucial because it conditions the effectiveness of the lure.
This technique involves lugging a lure or a live fish behind a boat.
It is often done using an echo-sounder to follow the structures and determine the most suitable places.
Once a catch is made, we will fish for the shot at the place where it was made.
Fishing at sea, is composed of different techniques depending on where you fish.
Literally throw in the wave, this fishing is practiced on all the littoraux.
The keys are visible on the pole on a spike or a tripod.
The assembly (hooks, lead grapple, pearls, etc.) will depend on the fishing site, the desired fish, climatic conditions (winds, currents ...)
This discipline, very technical, sees fishermen from all over the world compete on the shores of all the seas of the globe.
National or international competitions are organized by the federations or the big clubs.
To launch, there are two main techniques: The whipped pitch and the bow throwing (several names).
The principle of the bow thrown is to shoot the body of the fly until folding the cane.
The power of the cane will do the rest when you release the fly.
(Arched throwing is used mainly with ball nymphs.)
This technique is to let the line down on the bottom and wait for the key.
It is an active fishery, as opposed to fishing, where the fisherman keeps the cane in his hand.
The assembly consists of a heavy lead and one or more brackets with a suitable bait.
This type of fishing is used to target the voracious species that are usually caught with two small gallows.
The touch of the line results in a feeling of heaviness on the line.
It is necessary to bring it back quickly, then, past the cap of the 5-6 meters, continue a fight more in finesse.
For the game to continue indefinitely, you have to maintain the trust of other players.
Fishing with lures is a technique increasingly practiced in both freshwater and sea.
The lure can mimic injured prey to stimulate the appetite of the predator.
The lure may also have an incentive aspect to annoy the predator and play his hunting instinct.
Many predators respond to lures in freshwater as well as in the sea.
The fishing equipment (rod, reel, wire and lure) varies enormously according to the technique practiced and the desired fish.
This type of fishing does not require a highly developed experience or expensive equipment:
Used for all fish living in schools: mackerel, garfish, cod ...
If you are looking for mackerel, vary the depths of research.
Shark and some species of tuna fishing is prohibited or strictly regulated.
In general, this type of fishing is often undesirable from an environmental point of view.
Sport fishing is a passion above all else that can be categorized into sport in some cases.
This fishery has evolved from its origin, both in gear and catch and techniques.
The press offers many titles for fishing enthusiasts, some journals have been present for several decades.
Digital fishing magazines have appeared since 2012.
A spinning reel reel (4/0; 6/0 or 9/0) (depending on the desired fish)
A harness, this is an object used to hold the cane without getting too tired fighting with the fish.
Nylon thread or braid size between 60/100 and 100/100.
There is a recommended material for this fishing technique:
Ferrassi√®res is a french municipality, located in the department of Dr√¥me, in the region Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes.
The town is a crossroads where converge the departmental roads coming from Montbrun, Sault, Saint-Trinit, Revest-du-Bion and S√©deron.
The nearest municipalities are Saint-Trinit, Aurel, Montbrun-les-Bains and Barret-de-Lioure.
The town is separated from Barret-de-Lioure by the Col de l'Homme Mort.
Seismicity on the territory of the municipality is negligible but not zero.
The town is located on a bed of limestone layers with urgonian facies (Cretaceous).
This limestone is presented in a karst model with lapiaz, avens and sinkholes.
Linked to one or a few species of tree, the mushrooms abound, in season, on the plateau.
It is worth mentioning the presence of bats, predatory and nocturnal species (great rhinolophe, little rhinolophe, Leisler's noctule).
Inside a dry stone enclosure, numerous pieces of pottery and fragments of tiles were removed.
This site has been identified as an oppidum that was occupied from the lower Gallo-Roman era to the early Middle Ages.
This had been given to the Benedictines by Ripert de M√©vouillon in 1087.
In 1287, the seigniory of Ferrasi√®res was one of the fiefs of Raymond de M√©vouillon.
The village castle, ruined since 1330, was never rebuilt.
Il was located on the site of the cemetery, where he met encore au jour quelques d√©bris et vestiges.
In 1591, he married Lucretia de La-Tour-du-Pin-Gouvernet, daughter of Rene and Isabeau de Montauban.
Their second son, Jean, was Count of Ferrassieres, and their granddaughter, Espence, who bore the name of Dupuy-Montbrun-Ferrassieres, Countess.
The church is under the patronage of Saint Julien de Brioude.
Of Romanesque inspiration, it was built in 1678 and its door dates from 1771.
On the small square adjoining the right side of the nave of the parish church, there is a fountain-oratory.
Surmounted by a colorful statue of Joan of Arc, it was inaugurated in front of a large crowd in 1896.
It is found today in many mountains in Western Provence, including valleys or alpine plateaus.
For those which have been restored with taste, one always reaches the stage of dwelling by a staircase attached to the facade.
The terrace was used primarily to dry fruits and vegetables hanging from a wire.
She was called "trihard" when she welcomed a trellis that covered a rustic pergola.
When she formed a loggia, columns supporting an awning covered with tiles, she was called "galari√©" or "souleri√®".
It is the traditional home of the countries of "rich culture" or who has been (lavender).
This type of house is divided into two very distinct parts.
The ground floor is occupied by a common room in which the kitchen is integrated.
Very often there is at the back a storeroom containing the wine reserve and a room.
A narrow corridor, which allows access to the floor, separates this set of the second part reserved for animals.
This is, in most cases, a shed that can serve as a stable and a barn.
The floor is reserved for the rooms and the hayloft which corresponds by a whirlwind with the barn and the stable.
The construction of such an ensemble being spread over time, there was no pre-established architectural design.
Each owner acted according to his needs and in the order of his priorities.
What makes it possible to see today the heterogeneity of each set where the roofs of each buildings generally overlap in gradient.
The first was the need for a trellis still installed to protect the entrance.
The water supply was very often supplemented by a cistern that collected rainwater from the roof.
He was either directly attached to the house but also independent of her.
Still of considerable size, since it was supposed to ennoble the habitat, it rose on two floors, the last one being reserved only for pigeons.
It is also called pointed shed in the Proven√ßal Alps (Forcalquier region).
This type of construction realized only in dry stones, allowed herds to be active in the pastures.
It involves the use of an on-site habitat of "basic type" for the shepherd.
Depending on the place, it looks like a dry stone jas.
This shelter served him both as shelter and dairy.
In Provence, it is common in the mountainous regions, dry plateaus (plateau of Albion), hillsides worked in terraces.
The castle, now restored, has been converted to accommodate guests.
Only one hamlet on the town, the Hautes-Ferrassi√®res, which is in limit of culture.
Surrounded by "clapas", it is composed of some houses and a cemetery.
The nearest medical and para-medical services are in Montbrun-les-Bains.
There is no school in the town, children are educated in Sault.
People who could not send their children to a good school now have the means.
The nearest places of worship are in Sault, Monieux and Banon.
The "collection and treatment of household waste and similar waste" is done at Sault's waste disposal center.
The Institute is funded by voluntary contributions from governments, intergovernmental organizations, foundations and the private sector.
Certainly the government, like the private sector, must seek maximum efficiency.
Then, thanks to Roland Barthes, he is appointed to the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes.
He was also a visiting professor at Yale University in 1969.
G√©rard Genette has played and continues to play a fundamental role in advancing formal studies of literature.
Once again, Chancellor Merkel has a fundamental role to play.
In fact, animal studies have played a fundamental role in almost every important medical advance.
He is married to Raymonde Debray Genette, also a teacher and literary researcher.
Transtextuality is a concept that Genette developed, more particularly, in her book "Palimpsestes".
Through his work, G√©rard Genette defines key terms of narratological analysis.
Of course, there are also words from Franz Karl Stanzel's or Tzvetan Todorov's analyzes.
This notion is obviously central, since the whole act of narration is linked to diegesis.
Two elements are necessary for a metalepse to be established; to be more precise, two diegeses must be required.
This is a narrative instance telling its own story with its characters.
Several ways are possible to move from one spatio-temporal universe to another (different).
Thus, a narrator can lead us to move from one diegesis to another via, for example, a postal letter.
To continue to define the terms introduced in "Figures III", two criteria make it possible to precisely define the status of the narrator.
This last distinction highlights the terms "extradiegetic" and "intradiegetic".
In "The Work of Art", Volume 1, Genette develops an ontology of structured art around the concepts of immanence and transcendence.
Immanence refers to the multiple ways in which a work can exist, consisting of an object.
In 2014, G√©rard Genette commented on Wikipedia saying "I can not do without it, of course.
He is RPF deputy from 1951 to 1955 then UDT from 1962 to 1967 and finally UDR from 1968 to 1973.
Polytechnique (X1921), Louis Vallon adheres to the Jeunesses socialistes and in 1923, to the SFIO, where he supports Pierre Renaudel.
In 1933, Louis Vallon left the SFIO and joined the Socialist Party of France-Union Jean Jaur√®s Marcel Deat.
During the Second World War, he fought in the Resistance and then in the Free French Forces.
At the beginning of the conflict, he is recalled with the rank of captain in a unit of the Maginot line's engineers.
Taken prisoner after the campaign of France, he was released in 1941 and joined the Resistance within the movement Lib√©ration-Nord.
He joined General de Gaulle in London and became deputy director of his cabinet.
After the dissolution of the RPF, Louis Vallon does not join the group of the URAS and sits among the non-registered.
In 1955, he founded the Democratic Union of Labor, with Ren√© Capitant, Yvon Morandat and Jean de Lipkowski.
In November 1955, he proposed the creation of a "Popular Front" including the Communists, marking his re-engagement on the left.
He is appointed in the same period as a member of the Economic and Social Council.
But bad economic times are rarely times when governments introduce bold international economic proposals.
A recognized specialist in public accounts, he was then general rapporteur of the Finance Committee from 1962 to 1967.
The 1967 Order of Participation and the 1969 Referendum were the first achievements of this project.
A lively personal and political animosity opposed him to Georges Pompidou, whom he had been friends with.
Constantly hostile to Georges Pompidou, Louis Vallon was then excluded from the Political Bureau of the UDR Group.
He married Suzanne Braun, a Jewish ophthalmologist, with whom he will not have children.
The Women's Volleyball World Cup is an international volleyball sport competition.
International sports competitions are, of course, an indirect exercise of chauvinism.
Oxycodone, dihydrohydroxycod√©inone, or dihydro-oxycod√©inone, is a very potent narcotic analgesic derived from thebaine.
Developed in 1916 in Germany, it is prescribed to relieve moderate and severe pain.
Oxycodone is in the form of an odorless white crystalline powder derived from a polysynthetic alkaloid of opium: thebaine.
The chemical structure of oxycodone is methylether of oxymorphone: 3-methyl-oxymorphone.
It is similar to codeine, but more potent and with a higher potential for dependence.
In France, the prescription of OxyContin and Oxynorm is limited to 28 days, in letters on secure prescription.
Oxycodone is a pure opioid agonist whose main therapeutic action is analgesia.
Since September 2012, oxycodone is authorized for certain severe non-cancerous pains.
Indeed, the prescription framework for Level III analgesics (WHO) is much broader in Canada and the United States.
Thus, it is used to treat moderate postoperative pain, for example, or lumbar or dorsal pain, etc.
The dependence of oxycodone is similar to that of heroin, which is extremely strong.
The abuse of OxyContin has become a major public health problem in the United States and Canada.
The United States would have faced these problems anyway, even without a simultaneous financial crisis.
The FDA will now require new labeling for all opioid drugs, to inform users of the risks involved.

Qiu Xiaolong, born in Shanghai in 1953, is a Chinese author of detective novel, poet and tai chi lover.
His father, a teacher, was a victim of the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution around 1966 and he himself was banned from studying for several years.
The father died as a result of mistreatment during the Cultural Revolution.
Nevertheless he succeeds in learning English and continuing his studies.
In 1988, he joined Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri to continue his studies.
Qiu Xiaolong now lives in the United States and teaches at the University of St. Louis.
His hero, Chief Inspector Chen Cao, is also a poet (Qiu Xiaolong has defended a thesis on the American poet T.
Among the recurring characters in Qiu Xiaolong's novels are:
In 2001, Qiu received the Anthony Award for the first novel for his book "Death of a Red Heroine".
"Jasminum polyanthum" received its first botanical description by Adrien Franchet in 1891 (Rev.
270), a botanist from the Museum who worked on the herbaria brought back from China by Father Delavay (1834-1895).
This term now refers to "Jasminum sambac", a single-leaf shrub.
"Jasminum polyanthum" is a climbing shrub with semi-evergreen foliage, glabrous twigs, terete or angular, and green.
The inflorescence is a "raceme or panicle bearing a large number of flowers (up to 50)".
The abundant and fragrant flowering takes place from February to August.
"Jasminum polyanthum" is a plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and central China (Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan).
It has become naturalized in New Zealand and Australia where it tends to become invasive.
He is then mounted on a roll of wire approximately 40 cm high.
Summer is better to take out the pot outside, in full sun where it will continue its flowering.
To bloom again, pink jasmine needs to winter in a cool greenhouse.
I cultivated in a subtropical region, the purple flower of a pure white.
The jasmine flower, "molihua" ËåâËéâËä±, is used in traditional Chinese medicine.
Like many other traditional Chinese medicines, acupuncture has been considered suspicious for centuries by the West.
Dresdner Bank was one of the largest banking companies in Germany.
In 2001, the insurance company Allianz Group bought the Dresdner Bank.
In September 2008, Commerzbank announces its acquisition, the acquisition is finalized in 2009.
In 2006, she published a study that demonstrates her involvement in Nazism.
The Dresdner Bank had a very important art collection, one part was open to the public, the other part being held as an investment.
But by cutting public investment, they are blocking private investment.
It is extremely important that public services, public investment and public policies are well managed.
He is the son of Michel VIII Pal√©ologue and Th√©odora Vatatz√®s.
He inherited a restored empire following the recovery of Constantinople by his father against the Crusaders in 1261.
In Finnish, the various religious quarrels who make up the regime of Andronic fragile more then the Byzantine Empire declining.
Nevertheless, Andronic has helped achieve a cultural renaissance enterprise, as well as lasting financial and judicial reforms.
During his reign, Andronicus II takes the opposite of the policy of his father.
Andronicus II was associated with the throne in 1272 by Michael VIII, the latter wanting to legitimize the dynasty Palaeologus, still recent.
In fact, it is the great servant Michel Tarchaniot√®s who directs the army.
This led to the fall of Andronicopolis around 1280, after the departure of Andronic.
This defeat led to the end of the domination of the Byzantine Empire in southwestern Asia Minor.
Like many of his predecessors, Andronic is of a very religious temperament and he is very much involved in theological quarrels.
He also appears full of uncertainties and this favors the important influence that his entourage has.
Thus, Andronic is easily influenced by his ministers such as Theodore Mouzalon or Theodore Metochites.
In 1261, Michael VIII fulfilled the most fervent desire of the Nicaean emperors by resuming Constantinople.
The success of Michael VIII conceals a ruined and declining empire.
However, far from being unanimous among the Byzantine population, this policy reinforces tensions.
At the same time, the Byzantines seem to be unaware of the threat posed by the Turks in Anatolia.
This event moves the center of gravity of the empire towards Europe.
Indeed, he is convinced that the stability of the empire comes first and foremost by the resolution of the crises striking the Byzantine Church.
This policy led in 1274 to the Union of the two Churches, declared at the Council of Lyon.
Andronicus II is aware of this reality and, faced with the hostility of the population, he is on the side of the anti-unionists.
John XI Vekkos, the former Union Patriarch, is exiled at a council in Brousse in 1283.
If the empire does not know bloodshed, the Unionists undergo various vexations and the anti-unionists ask for condemnations.
Andronic brings a council to Adramyttion to end the division but the two parties can not be reconciled.
This allows Patriarch Niphon of Constantinople to find a solution to the schism of the Orthodox Church in 1310.
In September 1310, an encyclical of the patriarch consecrated the unity of the Orthodox Church despite the persistence of some isolated arsenite movements.
Georges Pachymeres, like Gregoras, both insist on the extreme frugality of his existence.
According to Athanasius, the calamities that fall on the empire and on the Church are due to the excess of luxury and pomp.
Thus, he diverts part of the income of a monastery to assist the poor.
He is replaced by the monk Cosmas de Sozopolis, who became patriarch in 1294 under the name of John XII Cosmas.
However, he supports the emperor in his attempt to condemn certain bishops who bribe their electors to reach the episcopate.
Once again, Athanasius begins a policy of rigor that strikes the clergy.
At the same time he strips the patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem of their property.
In 1309, Athanasius decided to devote himself definitively to the monastic life.
Far less ascetic than his predecessor, he seeks above all to preserve the unity of the Church.
From Niphon, the patriarchal seat changes ownership very often.
In 1314, Niphon gives way to John XIII Glykys after being convicted for simony.
Jean retired in 1319 and G√©rasimos succeeded him until his death in 1321.
After an interlude of two years, √âsaias reaches the patriarchate in November 1323.
Despite this instability, the influence of the Church remains strong and the patriarch enjoys new skills under Andronic II.
But in countries where the influence of the church remains strong, the opponents of IVF go up in the niche.
At the same time, the prestige of the Byzantine Church in Europe increases as the borders of the empire are reduced.
Thus, Andronic II creates the position of Metropolitan of Lithuania whose first holder is crowned by Jean Glykys.
For the navy, the evolution is even more disastrous since it is dismantled.
At the same time, the economy of the empire is not able to produce wealth.
If it still has them, they are in the hands of some big owners.
This regime leads to a gradual decrease in the number of indigenous people, forcing the empire to recruit mercenaries.
This feudalization of large estates diverts important revenues to the benefit of the aristocracy and monasteries.
At the time of the High Middle Ages, the annual revenues of the empire amounted to seven or eight million nomismata.
Sometimes this weakness of imperial power allows big landowners to take control of the provinces.
Among the few successes of Andronic is his judicial reform, begun after the earthquake striking Constantinople in 1296.
The old court of Hippodrome is replaced by a court of twelve judges (bishops, clerks, senators).
The Emperor swore an oath to the judges to be impartial to any citizen of the empire.
Unanimous decisions are binding on everyone, including the Emperor.
Since the capture of Constantinople in 1204, the Italian maritime republics occupy a large part of the former Byzantine maritime area.
The fall of the Latin Empire of Constantinople supported by Venice causes a certain downgrading of it which benefits Genoa.
However, there is a certain return to grace of Venice from 1285.
Venetians enjoy a district within the imperial city and see their sovereignty confirmed on Crete.
Very quickly, Andronic finds himself trapped in escalating tensions between Venice and Genoa.
In return, and despite Andronic's explanations, Venice sends 18 ships to Constantinople.
In 1310, this same treaty is extended for a period of twelve years.
Paradoxically, Genoa takes advantage of these events to increase the autonomy of its colony, Galata by building a wall.
This is the beginning of a period of Italian domination on the island that lasts until 1329.
The despot Nicephorus quickly accepts the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa compromise, and his wife, Anne Cantacuzene, attends the council of Adramyttion.
Michel is imprisoned in Constantinople and serves as a means of pressure against John.
However, the marriage of Isabelle with Florent de Hainaut changes the situation.
The latter is recognized as the prince but decides to sign a truce with Byzantium in 1290.
Nevertheless, Florent continues to serve the policy of Charles II against the Byzantine Empire.
Andronic then sends an army in Epirus, under the direction of Michel Glabas, supported by the Genoese Navy.
Indeed, Florent de Hainaut sends reinforcements just like Richard of Cephalonia.
However, this threat is only apparent because the principality of Achaia faces serious internal dissensions that benefit the Byzantines.
The latter obtain the marriage of Thomas Doukas, the son of Nicephorus, with one of the daughters of Michel IX.
In 1282, Stefan Milutin acceded to the Serbian throne and began the era of expansion towards Byzantine Macedonia.
From 1282, Scupi falls, soon followed by Serres, then the Serbs eventually reach the Aegean Sea.
The sending of Tatars against them by Andronic has little effect.
The Serbian army is very superior and threatens more and more Thessaloniki.
In 1297, Michel Tarchaniotes tried to repel the Serbs but without success.
For the Byzantines, Macedonia is definitely lost and they seek a diplomatic agreement.
For this, Andronic proposes the hand of his sister Eudocia to Stefan Milutin.
Andronic decides to offer Stefan the hand of his other daughter, Simone, five years old.
Toutefois, Andronic II defeated the Asie Mineure because they are accessing the barrio malgr√© the imminence of danger.
The Turkish question remains secondary for the empire, occupied by internal or European questions.
It was not until 1290 to see Andronic decide to pursue an active policy in Asia Minor.
He even chooses to settle there and let his son Michel IX at the controls of the State.
This opposition led Andronic back to Constantinople in 1293 where the plotters were tried and often imprisoned.
However, this event proves the lack of loyalty of the local populations towards the government since they support the cause of the rebels.
This general succeeds in carrying out a victorious policy against the Turks that he pushes back beyond the Meander.
Supported by the population and his troops, Philanthropenos rebels against Constantinople in 1295, not without hesitation.
Nevertheless, this revolt does not seduce the other military leaders and Philanthropenos is stopped before being enucleated.
Andronic then sends Jean Tarchaniotes fight against the Turks in 1298.
Despite his Arsenite sympathies, he won the support of the emperor and won important successes that allow him to receive reinforcements.
But, soon, the opposition of the patriarch to his appointment and those of his officers push him to leave his post.
He is replaced by other generals who are often mediocre and who do not obtain convincing results in the war against the Turks.
In 1302, he managed to hire Alans fleeing the Mongols.
They are under the command of Michel IX who establishes his camp in Magnesia.
The latter then shows a surprising passivity as the Turks loot the surrounding countryside.
As a result of this battle, the countryside is ravaged and the population then fled to Europe.
In 1304, the Byzantines led by Progonos Sgouros were beaten again, confirming the impotence of the empire to fight the Turkish threat.
Only external help seems to be able to save the last Asian possessions of the Byzantine Empire.
Andronic first asks for help from Ghazan, the Mongol Khan of Persia, but he died in 1304.
This new loss helps remove communications between Nicea and Nicomedia.
In Asia Minor, the different places try to defend themselves as they can.
The salvation of the empire then seems to be in the hands of a group of Catalan mercenaries led by Roger de Flor.
Moreover, their successes have no future, although Roger de Flor walks to the borders of Little Armenia.
Ephesus is however taken over by the Turks, shortly after the departure of the Catalans.
As he prepares to lay siege to the city, he is called by Andronic to fight the Bulgarian threat.
Led by Theodore Svetoslav, who got rid of the Mongolian tutelage, the Bulgarians invaded part of the imperial territory.
After a first defeat, Michel IX managed to win against the Bulgarians but without removing the threat.
The Catalan presence on the Byzantine lands reactivates the Angevins projects of conquest of Constantinople.
By remarrying with Catherine de Courtenay, Philip of Taranto takes again the inheritance of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.
However, in 1306, Philip allies with Venice, who can only see a good eye recovery of the Latins in Constantinople.
This would allow him to regain his economic domination over the region.
Finally, some Byzantine dignitaries say they are ready to support the Angevins.
The Franks then seek the support of the Catalan company that dominates the region of Cassandr√©ia.
However, despite an agreement in 1308, the Catalans decided to plunder the Thessaly led by Jean II Doukas.
It is estimated that Andronic gave nearly a million hyperp√®res to the Catalans, far more than the annual income of the Byzantine Empire.
Faced with such expenses, the Byzantine currency is devalued again in 1304.
Andronic increases the weight of the taxes on the landowners of Thrace but also on the monasteries.
Patriarch Athanasius strongly supports the emperor in his fight against this illegal trade.
Finally, thanks to the support of the Serbs, the Turkish troop led by Halil was defeated in the Gallipoli peninsula in 1312.
In the south-west of Asia Minor, it is the emirate of Menteshe which develops at the expense of the Byzantine lands close to the Meander.
In the North, the emirate of Aydƒ±n emerges from the tutelage of Germiyanides and it is he who seizes Ephesus in 1304.
As for the Ottomans, they are confined to the north-west of Anatolia and beyond the Sangarios.
It is one of the smallest emirates but also the one who benefits the most from the erosion of the Byzantine Empire.
In 1307 he controlled the surrounding countryside the cities of Nicaea, Nicomedia and Brousse.
The Byzantine Empire is then powerless because caught in its dissensions with the Catalans and Turks, present in Europe.
At the end of the 1310s, the situation finally seems to be recovering for the empire.
The Catalans settled in Greece while the restoration projects of the Latin Empire of Constantinople have definitively disappeared.
Despite these few successes, the empire soon faces a dynastic quarrel that undermines its strength.
The question of his succession worries very early Andronic II, which associates his son Michel IX to the throne since 1294.
Michel has two sons of this woman: Andronic and Manuel.
Yolande wants the division of the empire between his three sons and Michel IX, which is unimaginable for the Byzantine Empire.
He is at the origin of a tragic accident in which he and his men inadvertently kill his brother Manuel.
This shock precipitates the death of Michel IX, who has just experienced the death of his daughter Anne, not long ago.
Andronic's son died in 1320, leaving Andronicus III as the only co-emperor.
This resentment is heightened by the relative prosperity of the great landowners of Thrace.
At the external level, Asia Minor seems definitively lost and only a few cities still resist behind their walls at the Turkish thrust.
Among his closest allies are John Cantacuzene, Syrgiannes Paleologist and Theodore Synadenos.
Cantacuzene and Syrgiannes Palaeologus took advantage of the discontent of the population to occupy various commands in Thrace and raise troops.
This allows Andronicus II to resume the fight against his grandson in December 1321.
This armed struggle soon exhausted the resources of Andronicus III, who must count on the help of John Cantacuzene.
After having repulsed the Bulgarians, Andronicus III enters Bulgaria and he leaves one of his generals to resume Philippopoli.
Soon after, Andronicus III reiterated the certainty of being the heroic of Andronicus II because he was finally crowned by Empereur in 1325.
However, this apparent harmony conceals a deep mistrust between the two emperors.
In desperation, Andronic II recalls Alexis Philanthropenos to fight against the Turks who besiege Philadelphia.
However in 1326, the city of Brousse falls to the Ottomans.
In May 1327, Andronicus III signed a treaty of alliance with his brother-in-law and Khan of the Bulgarians Michael III Chichman.
In response, Andronic II allies with Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski, the king of Serbia.
At the same time, the promises of Andronic III allow him to gain popularity.
In June 1328, the city of Thessaloniki stands on its side as most of Byzantine Macedonia.
However, the latter blocks the passage to the Bulgarian army and persuades his leader to withdraw.
The last support of Andronic II disappearing, it is his throne which is lost.
Accompanied by 800 men, Andronicus III dispossesses his grandfather, without violence.
In 1284, Andronicus II remarries with Yolande de Montferrat, daughter of William VII of Montferrat and Beatrice of Castile.
Renamed "Irene", this second wife gave him four children:
The opinion of contemporary Byzantine historians on the reign of Andronic is rather fluctuating and depends on their proximity to the emperor.
However, many authors after his reign gave negative opinions on Andronic II, considered mediocre and weak.
Modern historians present a much more nuanced record of Andronic's action.
Like Ostrogorsky, Louis Br√©hier admits that the means available to Andronic are insufficient to fight the crisis of the empire.
The advantage of the use of oxygen in a hyperbaric environment is manifested for the transport of this gas by the blood:
In this case, the use of the hyperbaric chamber can prevent certain complications:
The study was partly funded by a hyperbaric medicine center.
At the end of this study, AETMIS comes to the following conclusions:
Recompression box treatments can take place in several ways:
The most frequently used tables are tables 5 and 6.
The risks associated with this therapy are the same as those related to diving:
Moral risk has been reduced but risks related to investing in emerging markets have increased.

Faye-la-Vineuse is a commune in the Indre-et-Loire department in Center-Val de Loire in northern France.
However, in the Middle Ages, this walled city counted about ten thousand people intra and extra muros.
It was indeed the most important city in the region before Richelieu was built.
Its name comes from the Latin "Fagus" (beech) which gave "Fagia", then "Faye".
The city was the center of a stronghold that roughly corresponded to the present canton.
The fact that the town was built on a hill was decisive in the role of the defense.
The town of Braye-sous-Faye still bears the trace in his name.
The ramparts were pierced by four monumental gates, each with a drawbridge.
In 1064, Raoul de Ch√¢tellerault worked on the development of the city, building three churches and a crypt.
The population of the town and surrounding strongholds is estimated at about 10,000 inhabitants.
In 1790-1794, Faye-la-Vineuse annexed the commune of Saint-Jouin-l√®s-Faye, and in 1795-1800 it annexed Marnay.
The main monument of the commune of Faye is the collegiate church Saint-Georges, religious building very important at the time medieval.
The set is of Romanesque style but its design announces the Gothic.
From the sky, the church of the collegiate church is shaped like a cross facing east.
It has a nave and choir rather remarkable and very well preserved.
It is said that his crypt once contained several relics, one of which was none other than St. George's tooth.
According to history, the tooth was taken by Protestants during the wars of religion.
The crypt was also dedicated to the Holy Sepulcher and St. Mary Magdalene.
However, the medieval village character displayed on the signposts seems exaggerated.
The presence of about sixty second homes proves its power of attraction.
This power of attraction is what I call "soft power".
It sinks like a spur in Austrian territory and thus constitutes a corridor to cross for the Austrian rail network.
It is one of the oldest cities in the country and is a link between Hungary and its neighbor to the west.
His forum was where Sopron's main square is now.
During the great invasions Scarbantia was abandoned and when the Hungarians settled there there were only ruins.
The city took its current name at that time, a squire named Suprun.
The king rewarded it by elevating it to the rank of royal free city.
Located in Western Hungary, Sopron is currently experiencing a great expansion because economically it has long been linked to Austria.
Even today, dentists are very busy because of their prices, which are one-third lower than those of their Austrian colleagues.
His favorable situation between Vienna and Budapest calls for a great development that will make it an economic center of gravity.
The center of economic gravity of the world oscillates today towards this region.
Sopron is connected to the Hungarian rail network by the GySEV station.
This Austro-Hungarian company manages and maintains the lines of the hinterland of Sopron and Lake Neusiedl.
The symbol of the city is the Lantern Tower.
On its south side, the door of the Fidelity was erected in memory of the referendum of 1921.
A circular ditch replaces the old castle moat, the inner row of houses follows the route of the fortifications.
According to the INE for the first time in the country's history, deaths have outweighed births.
Spain has become in a few years one of the first countries of immigration on the planet.
The percentage of children born to foreign mothers was 13.8% in 2004, up 13.1% from 2003.
This is infant mortality, whose rate for Spain was 3.77 per thousand in 2006.
But the situation is similar to the Basque Country, Castilla y Le√≥n, Cantabria, the Canary Islands and even more pronounced in Galicia.
The net reproduction rate is the demographic indicator that measures the degree of replacement of one generation by the next.
Replacement is assured if the net rate is at least 1.00.
For Spain, the net reproduction rate was 0.663 in 2006.
In the past, Spain had a policy of almost no family support.
Apart from that, there was no public support for the family.
Finally, official development assistance from developed countries increased by 66%.
There are few public daycares and they are reserved for the most modest households.
The Spanish system does not provide any assistance for home childcare.
In January 2008, 5.27 million people, or 11.5% of the Spanish population, were foreign nationals.
Countries of origin with less than 1000 naturalized individuals are not included in this table
The arrival of African migrants on the Canary Islands has been publicized.
The prime minister had to respond to opposition attacks on this issue and asked for support from the European Union.
It promised to send naval air patrols to monitor the area.
On the other hand, the Spanish government has strengthened its diplomatic collaboration with West African countries.
He recalled that the largest immigration came from Latin America and Eastern Europe.
The following table shows the main data relating to the natural movement of the foreign population in Spain.
The third column (titled "Percentage") displays the percentage of a group of foreigners in relation to all of them.
This table only shows births by nationality of mother equal to or greater than 1000.
In Spain, same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004.
The following figures only concern marriages between spouses of different sex and thus exclude same-sex marriages.
Studies have pointed to the role of the Gibraltar Strait as a genetic barrier more than a point.
Parking is to leave a vehicle stuck for a while.
As such, parking policies are part of the Transportation and Land Use Policy.
However, in the densest areas, the provision of parking is made difficult by the lack of space.
This leads city planners to have to choose the urban function for which space should be used.
In France, the legislation of the early seventies seeks to adapt the city to the car.
In Belgium, the travel policy is implemented by the public authorities
Of course, many other factors, including policy implementation, can offset this pressure.
which have different tools: The Regional Development Plan (PRD), the Plan
Regional Land Use Planning (PRAS), the Communal Development Plans (PCD) and the Regional Travel Plan (IRIS plan).
There is a light normative framework set by the 1970 DE SAEGER circular.
The pull measures are related to public transport, car pooling and the use of two-wheelers.
In the Netherlands, the ABC policy aims to apply different standards in zones A, B and C:
However, the capital Amsterdam is concerned by this policy, although nowadays it no longer has visible effects.
According to the 1968 Vienna International Convention on Road Signs, a vehicle is said to:
A space or building specifically designed for parking vehicles is called parking or parking in Canada.
The regulations may vary according to the specificities of each country which mainly concerns the width and length of the vehicles.
This makes it possible to have larger cars in Quebec than in France.
This article describes the road regulations concerning parking on public roads.
This article describes the standards corresponding to the dimensions of the parking spaces.
This article describes parking pricing strategies for public parking.
It is located on the scientific campus of Villeneuve-d'Ascq in the North (59).
They were merged in 1974 to form the University School of Engineers of Lille (EUDIL).
In 1992 the recruitment of these three schools is done in common.
In 1994 the diploma specialty "production" is realized in partnership with the Institute of Engineering Techniques of Industry of Nord Pas-de-Calais.
In 2004 the path to the diploma specialty production is created.
This building will be built on the grounds previously occupied by the car park.
In September of the same year, the first official return of the √âcole polytechnique universitaire de Lille takes place.
With its eight specialties, Polytech Lille covers all major engineering fields.
Located in a large scientific university, it benefits from a rich research and training environment.
What should be the primary mission of universities - research, vocational training or social integration?
Its engineering cycle (3 years) is accessible after a course of engineering schools Polytech or CPGE, L2, L3, DUT, M1
Marc Batard is a mountaineer, speaker, painter and French photographer, born November 22, 1951 in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
His technical skill and his very strong endurance allow him this performance.
He became a guide and began a series of exploits, particularly in the Himalayas.
As such, he appears in the Guinness Book as the first climber to climb Mount Everest in less than 24 hours.
At age 43, he retired from the mountain of "committed" challenges.
He definitely stops mountaineering to devote himself to his children and grandchildren.
For the love of our children and the children of our children, we must act now.
Then he takes up the first passion of his childhood: painting.
In 1989, in Washington, he gave his first lecture abroad, followed by other conferences in Italy, Spain, Belgium, Canada, Portugal.
Saro-Wiwa was also doing business in the television industry, producing series.
He was also the author of the satirical TV series "Basye & Co.
", which has become the most watched soap opera in Africa.
In 1990, a founding member of the MOSOP, Saro-Wiwa launched himself more seriously in the struggle to save the Ogoni people.
The image of the company was tainted with abuses committed in the Niger Delta.
In May 1994, he was arrested for the third time and charged with inciting murder after the death of four Ogoni.
After one year's imprisonment, he was convicted and sentenced to death by a special court.
This trial was widely criticized by international human rights groups such as Amnesty International.
It would guarantee enforceable international human rights, environmental and labor rights.
He leaves two children: the journalist Ken Wiwa and Zina Saro-Wiwa the director and artistic journalist.
This event caused the suspension of Nigeria in the Commonwealth that was meeting in New Zealand at that time.
The Shell brand and its actions against the Ogoni people is one of the main examples chosen by the writer.
In 1956, the decision to develop a ballistic missile program was taken.
Soviet experts are available to train Chinese specialists.
The first missile, a copy of the R-2, Dongfeng 1 ("East Wind") or DF-1, was successfully launched in November 1960.
In May 1965, the construction of an artificial satellite was put back on the agenda as part of Project 651.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences is responsible for designing the satellite and setting up the network of ground stations.
Chinese leaders decide to set more ambitious goals for the space program.
A tracking and guidance network is built in Xi'an.
The first flight of the launcher FB 1 took place on August 10, 1972, but it was a partial success.
The first flight of the CZ-2 launcher, which takes place on November 5, 1974, is a failure.
The second shot manages to place orbit the satellite FSW-0 1 on November 26, 1975.
The death of Mao Zedong in 1976 led to upheavals in the country's priorities that also affected the space program.
The first Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile is successfully fired at full range in May 1980.
The organization and procedures in the space industry are reviewed with a view to greater efficiency.
China's space sector is committed to contributing to economic development and the focus is on practical applications.
To put the telecommunications satellite into geostationary orbit, the Long March 3 launcher is developed from 1980.
The launcher, which can put a mass of 1.4 tons in geostationary transfer orbit, makes its first flight in 1984.
The objective is to use the revenues generated by this activity to finance the gradual improvement of Chinese launchers.
After a relatively slow start, this commercial activity led to the launch of 28 satellites between 1990 and 1998.
In the interest of greater efficiency, two new entities replace the department as of 22 April 1993.

This project was abandoned in 1992 for Project 921.
Chinese crews are trained in the facilities of the City of Stars in Moscow.
China becomes the third space nation after the Soviet Union and the United States able to launch men into space.
The Chinese authorities publish for the first time in 2000 a white paper on Chinese space activity.
It is subdivided into three areas: technology, applications and science.
The Russians, however, remain well ahead with 33 launches, including 3 partial or total failures.
In June 2013, China has so far launched 232 spacecraft, including 26 foreign ones.
In early 2011, the Chinese government decided to give a boost to scientific missions.
In addition, feasibility studies of a dozen scientific missions are launched.
In parallel, the government decided to entrust the National Center for Space Science with the national responsibility for all scientific missions.
The main institutional actors in the Chinese space field are:
China's space industry includes both state-owned enterprises (CASTC and CACIS) and private companies.
The two largest companies in the space sector belong to the state:
China has three launch centers in 2010:
This is the launch pad of Wenchang that should be completed in 2014.
There are three sub-families of specialized launchers each serving one type of orbit:
The three launchers make their first flight in 2015 and 2016.
In addition, two light launchers using solid propellant began their career in 2010.
The Kuaizhou launcher with a capacity of 400 kg in low Earth orbit was launched for the first time in 2013.
Like India, China has huge needs that can be covered by space systems.
It has like this developed country in priority the application satellites.
Three satellites using the second generation platform (DFH-2) were launched in 1986-1988.
In 2008 and 2011, China launched two Tianlian relay satellites in geostationary orbit.
These satellites are based on a DFH-3 platform A third satellite is to be launched in 2012.
The China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) or ZY Zi Yuan satellites have been developed with Brazil.
These satellites provide permanent optical coverage for the prevention and monitoring of major disasters.
The satellites are financed by a private Chinese company 21AT and its subsidiary BLMIT which markets the images produced.
The State Office of the Sea launches ocean observation satellites of the Haiyang (Ocean) family.
China has both geostationary and scrolling satellites to collect meteorological data.
Two generations have been started or are under development.
The first first-generation geostationary satellite FY 2A was placed in orbit in 1997 after an unsuccessful attempt in 1994.
The series of these spinned satellites of 1.38 tons must include 9 copies, the last of which should be launched in 2015.
These satellites occupy the 105 ¬∞ East position above the Indian Ocean.
The new generation under development FY-4x should be stabilized 3-axis.
The first generation polar satellite, FY1A, was launched in 1988.
The Chinese Army has sought to be equipped very early with a positioning system similar to the GPS system developed by the Americans.
This system, called Beidou less sophisticated than the GPS is based on a constellation of geostationary satellites.
Several crew missions follow him at a relatively slow pace.
A slow pace will take away all credibility and too fast a pace will kill growth.
But this objective requires the disposal of the launchers of the new generation, the only ones capable of putting into orbit the necessary masses.
A second, more sophisticated space station prototype, Tiangong-2, is launched on September 15, 2016.
The first Chinese space probe Chang'e 1 is placed in orbit around the moon in November 2007.
Before that China plans to launch a lunar sampling return mission Chang'e 5 to 2017.
China's scientific satellites have been relatively small since the beginning.
SJ-8 takes the structure of the FSW satellite and includes a recoverable capsule.
Two scientific missions are developed in cooperation with other space agencies.

It grouped almost exclusively ethnic Africans and Xhosa (99%).
"Transkei" means "territory beyond the Kei River" as opposed to Ciskei.
The territory corresponding to Transkei, located upstream of the Kei River, is then little colonized by the Europeans.
The Cape Parliament then decided to use a system of indigenous councils to administer all these new territories together.
In 1903, the General Council of the Transkei gave way to a General Council of Transkei territories.
Composed of an executive council of 4 magistrates and 4 representatives of the Bunga.
This is the equivalent of an indigenous parliament, charged with legislating on indigenous laws and customs applying to the territory.
He will then be led with an iron fist by Kaiser Matanzima, a nephew of Nelson Mandela.
From 1978 to 1980, the Transkei will negotiate territorial changes with South Africa in vain.
This will create the unique situation of a "country" refusing to negotiate with the only nation that has recognized it.
In 1987, a coup led by Bantu Holomisa overthrew the corrupt regime of George Matanzima, the brother of Kaiser Matanzima.
In 1994, Transkei became the eastern part of the new province of Eastern Cape.
It was slightly larger than Switzerland.
Originally, the Transkei was formed from the former Xhosas territories that were Idutywa Reserve, Fingoland (Mfenguland) and Galekaland (Gcalekaland).
Its coastline includes the C√¥te Sauvage, a region with extreme biodiversity.
At their head, a president of the assembly was elected for seven years.
The elected president wishes to act, but the assembly refuses to approve the necessary laws, or vice versa.
The executive consisted of a government and a prime minister accountable to the legislature.
The "Transkei National Independence Party" or TNIP (for "National Transkei Independence Party") was the ruling party.
There was also another party, the "Democratic Party".
In the legislative elections of September 29, 1976, TNIP won 68 eligible seats and the Democratic Party won seven.
In the legislative elections of 24 September 1981, the TNIP won all 75 eligible seats.
The Transkei was designed for the Xhosa people who also had Ciskei.
The flag was abandoned on April 27, 1994 with the reintegration of the Transkei into South Africa.
During its existence, the Transkei issued 318 postage stamps and 12 souvenir sheets with the caption "Transkei".
Brother-in-law of Lise Ricol and her husband Artur London, he was also elected deputy and senator.
Raymond Guyot's father was a carter and died of a work accident one year after his birth.

During his military service, he was sentenced to sixty days in prison, fifteen of which were for "activist activity".
The International had entrusted the leadership of the party to this group to apply the "class against class" policy.
But taking the leadership of a political party is always easier than being elected president of the United States.
When the International changes policy, it is he who is used by his representative Eugen Fried to denounce the fractional group "Barb√©-Celor".
He was finally arrested on June 24, 1932, and served one year in prison.
In April 1936, he went to Moscow to take office as Secretary of the ICJ.
In 1937, he was elected deputy for Villejuif, replacing Paul Vaillant-Couturier, who had died.
In 1939, Raymond Guyot was in the USSR at the time of the signing of the German-Soviet Pact.
It is unclear whether he carried instructions from Dimitrov to the French party.
Fallen from his duties on January 24, he deserted and joined Moscow via Belgium.
Raymond Guyot and Francine Fromond win Lyon, where Raymond Guyot will be one of the main leaders of the party, for the southern zone.
The main political objective of the leaders of both parties is lower taxes, especially for the rich.
In addition to his physical courage and sense of organization, Raymond Guyot stands out for his loyalty to the PCF.
In 1952, he participated in the eviction of Charles Tillon and Andr√© Marty, not hesitating to denounce the latter as a police officer.
London was released in 1955 and allowed to leave for France in 1963.

Without real political experience, the new ruler is deprived of all power by the Venizelists and imprisoned in his own palace.
His Prime Minister, the Cretan Eleftherios Venizelos, governs with the support of the powers of the Entente.
They are the parents of Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (1945), current pretender to the throne of Serbia.
The boy also makes many trips abroad.
Very close to her younger sister H√©l√®ne, Alexandre is less so than his older brother Georges, with whom he has little affinity.
Unlike George, who does part of his military training in Germany, Alexander does all his studies in Greece.
He thus integrates the "School of Evelpids", the main Greek military academy, which has already trained many of its uncles in the artillery.
In fact, Alexandre is passionate about cars and motorcycles.
He is one of the first Greeks to buy a car.
Judged very beautiful by her contemporaries, she immediately seduces Alexander who, at the age of twenty-one, already collects conquests.
However, Aspas√≠a is reluctant to face this prince who is courting him.
Very in love, the couple is very fond of each other but the commitment remains secret.
Alexander is not touched but his mother saves her youngest sister from the fire.
Under the threat of a disembarkation of the Entente at Piraeus, the sovereign agrees to go into exile, without, however, officially abdicating.
The Allies do not wish to establish the republic in Greece, one of the members of his family must succeed him.
Above all, he is faithful to his brother and categorically refuses to ascend the throne.
However, the dismissal of Constantine is not unanimous among the ancient Protecting Powers of the Hellenic Kingdom.
Russia, however, is not listened to and it is indeed as a monarch that Alexander ascends the throne.
No festivities or pumps surround the event, which remains secret.
Above all, he is aware that his reign is in any case illegitimate.
The very evening of the ceremony, the royal family decides to leave the palace of Athens to go to Tato√Ø.
On June 11, the king and his family manage to escape in secret from their residence.
Finally, the powers of the Entente recommend the appeasement to Venizelos and Alexander retains the crown.
They are about to visit the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Hellenic troops.
At the end of the First World War, Greece greatly expanded its 1914 borders.
The treaties of Neuilly (1919) and S√®vres (1920) confirm the territorial conquests of the country.
Alexander becomes the sovereign of a Hellenic kingdom with territory increased by about a third and he is not a little proud.
However, it is not the monarch who gets the glory but, again, Venizelos.
Nevertheless, the Greeks are not satisfied with the territorial gains they derive from the First World War.
In return, however, the king promised to be his witness on his wedding day.
In these circumstances, Alexander agreed to postpone his project until peace was restored in Greece.
However, as the months pass, the young king is more and more resistant to separation from his family.
In spite of everything, the marriage of Alexander and Aspas√≠a does not have only enemies.
Finally, among the foreign powers themselves, and particularly the English Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe hypothesis of this marriage is seen with a good eye.
Faced with oppositions, Alexander and Aspas√≠a decide to get married secretly.
Finally, Aspas√≠a and her husband receive permission from the government to return to Greece together in the summer of 1920.
In the Hellenic capital, "Madame M√°nos" is first welcomed at her sister's home before moving to the palace of Tato√Ø.
It is during this period that she becomes pregnant, and the couple is very happy.
But, in doing so, another primate attacks Alexander and bites him deeply in the leg and in the region of the stomach.
The plaie du souverain is ensuite nettoy√©e et pans√©e mais pas caut√©ris√©e.
Operated seven times, he is watched by the only Aspas√≠a during the four weeks of his agony.
Under the effect of poisoning, the young king suffers atrociously and his cries of pain fill, at times, the royal palace.
On October 19, he begins to delirium and calls his mother to him in his coma.
However, the Greek government refuses to allow Queen Sophie to return to the country.
Two days after the death of the monarch, his funeral is celebrated in the Cathedral of Athens.
The body of Alexander is then buried on the lands of the royal estate of Tato√Ø.
Before leaving, however, he asked Queen Olga to accept the regency until Constantine returned.
The restoration of the king, however, does not bring the peace expected by the population.
Worse, it prevents Greece from receiving the support of the great powers in the war against Turkey.
After these events, the country is sinking into a deep political and moral crisis.
But the profound differences in the foreign policy of the two countries will not make things any easier.

There is a bust of him in Richmond's O'Higgins Square, southwest of London.
Every year, a ceremony is held in the presence of members of the Chilean Embassy.
A plaque was erected at Clarence House, still in Richmond, where he lived while studying in London.
There are also plaques in his honor at Merrion Square, Dublin, and Sligo.
In Buenos Aires, there is a large statue of him in the center of Plaza Rep√∫blica de Chile.
A plaque was also erected in Cadiz, in Plaza de Candelaria, where he lived for four years.
His statue in the city of Concepci√≥n was destroyed by the 2010 earthquake.
It is located in the northernmost part of the Antarctic continent.
Placed after the Order of Merit of Chile, the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins is today the second national order of Chile.
AD, which for a long time is the literary and diplomatic language par excellence of the Middle East.
The history of the Babylonian language is divided into four main periods:
The basic text for the study of this language is the Hammurabi Code.
At that time, Akkadian became the diplomatic language, as well as a literary language (see below).
Under the name "Standard Babylonian", it is also the literary and diplomatic language of this period (see below).
From a grammatical point of view, the cases of nouns and adjectives are less marked.
In general, the Babylonian is then very influenced by Aramaic, which then becomes the main language of the Middle East.
The fall of the neo-Babylonian empire in 539 marks the end of the domination of a kingdom of Akkadian culture in Mesopotamia.
The last known cuneiform documents date from the beginning of our era.
Then the Akkadian culture dies, and the language she kept alive disappears.
Language is not only a means of communication, language is culture.
Federal MP Marie-Claude Bibeau, appointed Minister of International Cooperation in November 2015, is CIDA's policy officer.
The agency works closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Canadian and international partners.
The three priorities that guide CIDA's work are:
CIDA reports to the Canadian Parliament through the Minister of International Cooperation.
Regional offices are being distributed to better engage partners, individuals, the private sector and civil society.
The country's civil society is better organized, more powerful and more dynamic.
CIDA was created by decree in 1968 to replace the Office of External Assistance.
In particular, he has studied the role and added value of senior executives of multinational enterprises.
Prahalad lectured on economics at the University of Michigan, including the Ross School of Business.
Prahalad was particularly interested in the impact of globalization on emerging countries and their poorest populations.
Emerging countries rightly say that Western countries are responsible for the problem posed by climate change.
Russia is a rich country with a poor population, and redistribution works well under such conditions.
It enables people in the poorest countries to meet their basic needs.
He is the author and co-author of several books on finance and poverty:
Wailly-Beaucamp is a french municipality, located in the department Pas-de-Calais, in the region Hauts-de-France.
Its essentially sandy soil has long been exploited by quarries on the outskirts.
After 1377, the fief is attached to the lordship of Maintenay.
As in any village history, Wailly-Beaucamp has its share of miracles and legends.
During the revolutionary period, the village was spared violence despite the presence of the scaffold on a square in Montreuil.
The family of Cossette did not leave the castle and the priest Waro took the revolutionary oath.
From 1891 to 1955, the Aire-sur-la-Lys-Berck-Plage line crossed the village.
Because of the mail dispersal towards Wailly-les-Arras, the municipal council decided to rename the village in 1901.
The girls' school and the post office are built in 1908 along the road.
During the Great War the village paid for the blood of its inhabitants its share in the war effort.
In 1921, as everywhere in France, a monument to the dead was erected facing the porch of the church.
In 1960, the Stolz factory moved to the southeast of the village, it employs 370 employees in 2001.
The municipality has a multipurpose room facing the football field.
The new constructions are mainly on the so-called Boisjean road and the Monthodion.
Even though a new highway was under construction, the road was crowded with vehicles and animals.
The distribution of the population of the municipality by age group is, in 2007, the following:
The European Exhibition of Nature and Hunting, (7000 visitors in 2005, 11000 in 2007).
The town is home to a local club "Questions for a Champion".
Shortly after, Sylvia marries Jack Gahan and takes her two children to live in Basildon.
The new couple will have two other boys, Peter Eric (1966) and Philip Michael (1968).
I did my best, I made the laughter through the room.
I was really good for nothing else, but I saw that there was a reaction.
Dave made his first appearances as a singer for the Salvation Army, which included his mother.
"I have never been religious, although she applied her beliefs to me.
I used to go to Sunday school with my sister, Sue, on our bikes.
And instead of going, we were walking around the corner for a few hours.
And I found this man in my mother's kitchen who claimed to be my father.
I got angry because I thought my real father was dead.
The whole family shrieked because I thought I should have been informed.
For about a year, Len regularly visits Dave and Sue before disappearing, this time forever.
According to Dave, his mother told him that he had left to open a hotel in Jersey.
He has bad memories, especially remembering his teachers' mistrust of him.
It's funny that I remember, because I do not remember much of the last years.
All I was interested in was going out at night to see a concert.
I left everything at the age of sixteen and fled to London.
He describes himself as a destructive teenager, who instead of studying at school would rather hang around.
As a result of his criminal offenses, he will spend his weekends in a teenage center where he worked.
I was at this party, and I could not find my girlfriend anywhere.
I pushed the bathroom door, and there I see Mark's white ass coming and going.
It made me feel that I was not good enough.
Meanwhile, he lives small jobs: waiter, landscaper, seller in a perfume, among others.
He never managed to keep a job because of his rebellious attitude.
So, I applied for an apprenticeship with North Thames Gas.
My probation officer advised me to be honest during the interview, not to hide that I was a former juvenile delinquent.
Because of that, I did not get the job when I passed the Q.I.
He met John Lydon and George O'Dowd, future Boy George.
The teacher was a nice guy who smoked during class.
I liked everything that was designing clothes, it was a good experience.
Finally, he will be dismissed by the school principal because of his regular absences.
During a concert of The Damned, he met Joanne Fox with whom he became a friend before going out with her.
It is also during this period that he will play in a few bands, including one named The Vermine, with punk influence.
Bored, he began to listen to the records of David Bowie, Gary Numan, Roxy Music and the German group Kraftwerk.
We spent our evenings in London, then took the train from Liverpool Street.
I ended up getting bored with that, but for a while it was exciting.
He also states, "I had a double life, the art school gang and the house in Basildon.
In 1979, Dave Gahan mixed the sound for a group called French Look then made up of Vince Clarke, Martin L.
Martin knew him from sight: "He was not a complete stranger.
In fact, we all knew each other from college.
However, in 1980, Vince formed a new band called "Composition Of Sound" with Martin and Fletch.
According to Vince: "Dave was the local fashion accessory in Basildon.
He was one of those New Romantics, reputed to have attended the London Blitz Club.
"I had this group of friends who liked to dress and go to concerts.
So, we had an almost ready audience of about thirty people.
Dave and Alan bond very fast, facing the friendship of Martin and Fletch.
Finally, in 1984, the single People Are People will launch the band's career in the United States.
Finally, the United States decided to intervene without the agreement of the Security Council.
On August 3, 1985, he married Jo in the city of Brentwood.
In 1986, Depeche Mode released his album Black Celebration, containing the tubes "Stripped" and "A Question of Time".
During the recording at Hansa, the band repeatedly failed to come to grips, especially during the production of the title track.
Thus, they become the representatives of the new wave of English groups conquering the United States.
"Static performance is impossible in synthesizer groups.
I missed my wife, we did not even celebrate our first wedding anniversary together.
I did not really like it, because even though I love my job, I find it ideal, it's also physically and mentally exhausting.
In early 1987, the band began recording the album Music for the Masses, known to have been recorded in France.
They sit outside the recording studio and become barges if none of us go out.
And he has this combat jacket on him, and we think every time he's going to jump on us.
"My wife Jo and I had a baby in October, Jack.
I was pretty excited about it because we wanted one for a long time.
Then, when we did not believe it anymore, Jo discovered that she was pregnant.
My biggest fear was that the baby was born while I was on tour.
It turns out she had a dream about it.
Fortunately, the world tour begins a week after his birth.
The film 101 testifies to the incredible tour Modes, including across the United States.
Dave will experience a great period of unrest, especially during the first sessions in Milan.
Indeed, most of the time, the group goes out to party after spending his day in the studio.
The band then released Personal Jesus more than six months before the release of the album.
Despite their apprehensions, he will be a hit, and despite his words, will be regularly broadcast on radio, including the United States.
One can note that it is Dave who plays the introduction to the guitar on this piece in the studio version.
He will confide that this is the worst movie shoot, which lasted five days, and in difficult weather conditions.
The promotional tour "World Violation Tour", will be a real debauchery, all members of the group then consuming ecstasy.
Dave is all the worse when he learns of the death of his biological father, Len, whom he had not seen for seventeen years.
I absolutely want to have other children, but for now it's very difficult.
It would be a lie to say that we do not do certain things in the past or the present.
You may be tempted by drugs or girls, but they can not help but change your relationship, your marriage.
I am talking about personal experiences that I do not want to discuss.
Indeed, at that time, Dave is still trying to save his marriage.
You go on tour and it's great to meet different girls, to find pleasure.
It is there that you realize that you are making the lives of others in the air.
I felt trapped by everything around me.
In recent years, we have achieved even greater success than anything imagined before.
I was on top of the world, I had everything a man dreamed about, but I was really lost.
I felt really safe in my life in England, and I did not like that.
I had a loving and caring wife, a new baby, a big house, vintage cars.
Teresa Conroy then returned to work with Depeche Mode, this time as Tour Manager.
Dave then decides to leave his wife during a concert in Texas.
In the morning, you look in a mirror and suddenly, everything is very different, the perspective has completely changed.
I fell in love with her, I never felt that for anyone.
It brings out emotions in me that were totally unknown to me.
For years, I've been lying to people I'm supposed to respect and love.
That's when Dave's particularly intense years will begin, as the events will show.
I kept my apartment in London, I spend my time between the two places.
I needed to think about what I wanted to do with my life.
We have been working hard for the last eleven years, I need some time for myself and others as well.
The following year, the band went to Madrid to record their new album: Songs of Faith and Devotion.
¬´ I‚Äôm not looking for absolution, peace of mind for the things I‚Äôve done ¬ª chante Dave Gahan.
Appropriately welcomed by the local rock scene, he spends months to party without drying up.
His new companion Teresa Conroy and he succumb to a world they have no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dangers.
Gahan begins to adulate the Rolling Stones and begins to look like Keith Richards ...
Dave Gahan, constantly under the effects of heroin, is uncontrollable and alternates mystical crises, dementia and violence.
Flood tears his hair and thinks several times to throw in the towel.
The positive thing is that almost the entire album will be filled with this distress.
It releases a tension and a sense of urgency such as one finally meets on few records.
In any case, Dave Gahan probably never sang so well.
I want to be there for my son, I want to influence his life.
My father abandoned me, and I do not want him to grow up with that feeling.
She lets me see her on a regular basis and I wish her to meet someone who will make her happy.
During a concert in New Orleans, he will have a heart attack, forcing the group to do the recall without him.
However, he is so devastated that it will take twenty-four hours to realize it.
He and his wife rent a house in Lake Tahoe during his recovery, before leaving for a while in London.
It was then that Teresa confessed to Dave her desire to be a child.
Although shared, the singer has his head on his shoulders.
From that day, she began to go worse and worse.
I never went out without my 38, I was afraid of everything and everyone.
We were going far too badly to help each other.
It is also at this time that Dave will lose the shared custody of Jack.
"Usually, when Jack came to visit me, I could get clean.
She came, and I tried to assume my role as a father, to prepare my son's breakfast and all that.
I changed, I drank a lot of wine, I took a handful of valium.
I wrapped towels around my wrists and came back.
I told my mother that I was sorry, that I loved her.
Then I put my arms down and hung up.
He will wake up in a psychiatric hospital, interned for trying to kill himself.
In early 1996, the group returned to the studio to record the album Ultra in New York.
Dave is then unable to sing and will take a week to record the voices of the song Sister of Night.
Gahan later said it was more of a call for help than a serious attempt.
"I got out of prison and found myself at home on the couch.
I did not want my son to grow up wondering why his father died or committed suicide.
Dave will then offer the song The Ocean Song, but it will be rejected by Gore.
We can find her later in B of her single I Need You under the name of Closer.
The couple formed by Dave Gahan and Teresa Conroy officially divorce after five years of marriage, in bad terms.
"She told me that I was responsible for it, that I did not love myself enough.
Now the circle is complete as she has managed to get money from me, claiming that I am responsible for her.
"I met her in Arizona during a detox.
Then, I moved to New York, and I started seeing her and her son.
She did not even know Depeche Mode and really cared what I was doing.
He will testify a lot about his past as an addict during interviews, which he sees as a therapy.
The band will not go on tour, feeling absolutely not ready.
Dave then made his first solo project recording a cover of Roxy Music's A Song For Europe.
On July 29 of the same year, he became a father for the second time, a little girl named Stella Rose.
For the record, Stella was the first name of Jennifer's late mother.
He is also the only member of Depeche Mode to have maintained regular contact with Alan Wilder.
On June 5, 2000, Depeche Mode returned to the studio to record Exciter.
Dave has written songs for the album again but will be rejected again by Martin Gore.
My wife and Stella Rose miss me when I go to the studio or tour.
This is the first time in many years and I am determined not to throw it all in the air.
I still make mistakes but I do not want to run away anymore.
He will use songs written in the past that he will rework and compose new ones.
The big tube of the album, Dirty Sticky Floors, recounts his suicide attempt.
"I had these two huge statuettes in my Santa Monica apartment, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion.
It was complete paranoia, I was walking in my apartment with my 38 loaded in the back of my pants.
The single will be ranked and will reach eighteenth place on the charts in the UK and fifth place in the United States.
The album will be in the top 10 sales in Europe.
Dave then began a tour from June to November 2003, including the Glastonbury Festival.
A DVD, Live Monsters, will be recorded during the passage of the singer at the Olympia de Paris.
On January 17, 2005, Depeche Mode returned to the studio in Santa Barbara to record a new record.
There is this side in me that is a little strange.
I could never write a song about the euphoric beginning of a relationship.
It's hard for me to handle the love given by my family and friends.
Maybe I was disappointed once again in my life.
I am afraid to open my soul and give myself completely to someone else.
Maybe the reason is in my subconscious, deeply buried with my childhood.
We are very similar on this side, maybe that's why we are together.
The same year, Dave Gahan and Alison Mosshart play the models by becoming the muses of the Swedish stylist John Lindeberg.
What would happen if we all said the truth?
The album was ranked in the UK Top 50, the Top 20 in France and was number 1 in Germany.
The first single "Kingdom", is classified in the United Kingdom and the United States.
"Paper Monsters" was already a very personal album, "Hourglass" is too.
"I had just returned home after" Touring The Angel ", and I was trying to tidy up.
You tend to wait until you are told what to do.
You create new obsessions, like changing the way you load the dishwasher.
My wife and I had big conflicts on it, I always managed to go before her.
After a month, she asked me to find an occupation.
I met Christian and Andrew, and then we started working.
I talk a lot about my life, the difficulty of being a man of forty-five when you mentally twenty-five.
The band then returns to the studio to record their twelfth album, "Sounds of the Universe".
He will write three more songs for the album: "Hole To Feed", "Comeback" and "Miles Away / The Truth Is".
The first composed the music while the second wrote the lyrics.
In 2009, during the tour "Tour of the Universe", Depeche Mode is forced to cancel some of the concerts planned.
Given this operation quickly, the group was able to continue its tour.
Later, during a concert in Bilbao, the singer undergoes a tear of the calf muscle.
Finally, during a concert in Seattle, the singer undergoes vocal cord problems.
Alan was at the piano for an acoustic version of "Somebody" sung by Martin Gore.
The same year, he officially adopts Jimmy, the son of his companion.
In May 2012, Dave Gahan lent his voice and pen to the band Soulsavers.
The latter offered him a simple collaboration that eventually turned into an entire album ("The Light the dead see").
His greatest quality however remains his deep and warm voice that contrasts with the electronic music of Depeche Mode.
His hobbies are painting, music and attending concerts.
We can also note that the singer was influenced at length by Jim Morrison and his character of the King Lizard.
He also enjoys interpreting I Feel You, which allows him to discover his vocal tract.
In 2012, he appeared in an advertisement for Volkswagen, with the track "People are People".
The u, also called puman or p'uman, is a language of the palaungic group of the Mon-Khmer branch of Austro-Asiatic languages.
It is spoken in the southwestern region of Yunnan, China.
China has also been active south and west of its borders.
North and East of China are ahead of the south and west of the country.
Although the language u is distinct from the blang language, its speakers are part of the Blang ethnic minority.
In Canada, it was previously broadcast on Teletoon and in Morocco on 2M.
Stuck on Earth after crashing into a flying saucer, the extraterrestrials move into the attic of a house for rent.
The latter managed to return by creating a temporal paradox in the episode entitled '.
Zinzins consider humans to be under-evolved, while humans have a similar conception of extraterrestrials.
Here are the transformations that Gorgious, Stereo, Bud, Candy and Etno prefer:
When Candy watches TV, it's cleaning up at the same time.
In the episode "Candy has fun", Candy says he does not like football.
Bud is undoubtedly the most affected by the "patatophilous legumosis of the viewer" (a disease referenced in "TV connection").
Stereo returns in the episode "Champions of the world", as well as in "UFO".
Zinzins also change from season 1 to season 2.
Many winks from the series "Oggy and Cockroaches" appear in the "Zinzins of Space" and vice versa.
There are first of all similarities between the characters of the two series.
The characters of 'Oggy and Cockroaches' can appear in the "Zinzins of Space".
There are also similarities in the stories of the episodes of the two series.
At the global level, there may also be insufficient demand for tradable goods.
"Space Zinzins" were adapted into video games on Dreamcast, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS, and developed by Ubisoft.
Since 2006, "The Zinzins of Space" have been adapted into comics.
It is the first game of the Nintendo Wars series to be made entirely in 3D.
The project was proceeding very slowly and Kuju introduced it to several publishers including Nintendo.
The game was so popular with the Japanese firm that she decided to integrate it into his series of "Wars".
The first playable demo was presented at E3 2004 under the name "Advance Wars: Under Fire".
Note that a multiplayer mode was present but was removed for lack of time from the developers.
Marshal Nova, son of Tsar Gorgi, leader of the Tundra Territories, wants to put an end to this war.
Not being able to end a war is sometimes worse than not being able to win it.
But his father does not share the same ideas and will attack the Western Federation without the consent of his son.
The Xylvanian troops then invaded the Coral Atoll, property of the Empire of the Dawn, to make it an advanced base.
But the Alliance of Nations forces them to retreat to their territory.
Ingrid then welcomes in her the spirit of the Legion and commands this army from the Memorial.
The Iron Legion refuses to be controlled by anyone other than Ingrid and even goes as far as attacking Xylvania.
But the Western Federation and its allies will succeed in destroying it, destroying the Memorial, source of power of the Legion.
The Xylvanian army, meanwhile, took refuge in Vlad's palace, the Vladstag.
The Alliance besieges the building, and after a bitter fight, Commander Ubel is arrested.
But the Duke Vlad managed to escape in his Personal Attack Helico ...
The action usually consists of defending a position or capturing an enemy structure.
The player can win only by developing a good strategy and managing his troops well.
The game is divided into several campaigns, which are divided into missions.
In ancient times the heart of the city was known as Ox Te'tuun.
This mighty Mayan city was inhabited for more than a millennium, before being swallowed up by the jungle after its abandonment.
Calakmul was the seat of what has been called the Serpent Kingdom.
This Kingdom of the Serpent reigned, like Tikal, during most of the classical period.
Calakmul was a real urban center and not just a residential center for the elite surrounded by commoners' homes.
The glyph-emblem of Calakmul had a larger dissemination area than any other Maya city.
The glyph is also found in hieroglyphic texts more frequently than any other Glyph-emblem, including that of Tikal.
Half a century later, Tikal also won big victories over Calakmul's most important allies.
Half a century later, Kennedy's words apply to the agreement with Iran.
Eventually, both cities succumbed to the collapse of the classical Maya civilization.
The great rivalry between these two cities may have been based on other reasons than mere competition for access to resources.
The kings of Calakmul were known as "k'uhul kan ajawob" ("Divine Lords of the Serpent Kingdom").
There are gaps in this list as the archaeological data are incomplete.
Calakmul was already a big city during the pre-classical period.
The beginnings of Calakmul's history are obscure, but a dynastic lineage has been restored that goes back to ancestral past.
The history of the IAEA goes back to the dark beginnings of the Cold War.
Another K'altuun Hix vassal was captured by Yaxchilan on the banks of the R√≠o Usumacinta in 537.
This event is used as a marker to separate the old classical period from the late classical period.
"Sky Contemplator" is also mentioned at Yo'okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo.
The last reference to "Contemplator of Heaven" was found in Caracol and is dated 572.
The text is damaged, but probably refers to the death of this powerful king.
Janaab'Pakal died in March 612 and Ajen Yohl Mat a few months later.
King Yuknoom Ti'Chan of Calakmul oversaw a ceremony in Caracol in 619.
In 631, "Yuknoom-T√™te", the new king of Calakmul, finally got hold of Naranjo.
Yuknoom Ch'een II was 36 years old when he ascended the throne of Calakmul in the year 636.
In the year 648 Calakmul attacked Dos Pilas and won a landslide victory marked by the death of a lord of Tikal.
Tikal launched a counterattack against Dos Pilas in 672, forcing B'alaj Chan K'awiil into an exile that lasted five years.
The unrest continued in the east after a resumption of conflict between Naranjo and Caracol.
When he died, Calakmul was the most powerful lowland city in the central Mayan country.
He was born in 649 and was probably the son of his predecessor.
Four years later, in August 695, the two states once again went to war.
El Peru was also a vassal and Yuknoom Took'K'awiil installed a new king on an unknown date.
Yuknoom Took'K'awiil ordered seven more stelae on the occasion of the end of the Katun of 731.
Wamaw K'awiil reigned in Quirigu√° on the southern outskirts of Mesoamerica.
This act of local rebellion seems to have been only one episode of the great political struggle between Tikal and Calakmul.
In 738 K'ak'Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured the mighty but powerful king of Cop√°n, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil.
The captured lord was brought back to Quirigu√° and on May 3, 738, he was beheaded ritually in public.
In the late classical period, the alliance with Calakmul was often associated with a promise of military support.
A monument was erected in 790, although the name of the officer in charge of its construction was not preserved.
Two others were made in 800 and three in 810.
This was a process that ran parallel to the Tikal events.
However, there is strong evidence of the presence of an elite in the city until the year 900, perhaps even later.
However, it is unlikely that Calakmul still existed as a significantly organized state at this late date.
A new stele has been erected, although the inscription mentions only the day, not the full date.
The day entered may correspond to either the year 899 or the year 909, the latter date being the most likely.
However, the inscriptions on these monuments are only imitations devoid of any sense of original writing.
Morley himself visited the ruins, on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1932.
In the 1930s the researchers mapped the main site and listed 103 steles.
The stone used in the construction of the site is a soft limestone.
About 92 structures consist of large pyramids arranged around squares and courtyards.
The area between the residences was used for horticulture.
The site is surrounded by a vast network of canals and reservoirs.
Their total capacity is estimated at more than 200 million Liters.
Aguada 1 is the largest of the reservoirs and it has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 ha.
Two of them were mapped, three were visually identified on the ground and three others were identified by remote sensing.
They have been numbered under the names of "sacbe 1" to "sacbe to 7".
It is located inside the urban area constituting the main site.
Sacbe 1 was mapped in the 1930s by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
It has also been located in the central urban area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site.
The sacb√© 2 is built of clay and was discovered during archaeological excavations in a nearby quarry.
It is also visible from the top of Structure 1 and was discovered in 1982.
The sacb√© 8 is located on the western side of the marsh and does not seem to cross it on the main site.
A number of steles were erected at its base by Yuknoom Took'K'awiil in 731.
Structure 2B was the central sanctuary, 2C was located to the east and 2D to the west.
The facade included six large masks between these stairs, three of which were arranged vertically on each side of the central staircase.
Later buildings were erected at the base of the facade, each containing several stelae.
The pieces were divided into three groups of three, each placed in a row at the end of the previous one.
The first two rooms of each series (parts 1 to 6.)
were used for the preparation of food, metates and hearths were found in each of them.
Room 7, the room to the southwest, was a sauna.
Structure 4 (or Structure IV) is a group of three temples on the east side of the Central Plaza.
It is divided into three sections, referred to as Structures 4a, 4b and 4c.
The central structure of 4b is built on a basement dating from the pre-classical period.
Structure 5 (or Structure V) is a large building located on the north esplanade of Structure 2.
AD, although the building itself was erected earlier, during the pre-classical period.
Structure 7 (or Structure VII) is a pyramid temple located on the north side of the Central Plaza.
Five steles were erected on the southern face of the pyramid.
It was built in several phases of construction from the beginning to the end of the late classical period.
The pyramid was surmounted by a temple of three rooms which had a high jagged roof covered with stucco.
A patolli game board was dug into the ground of the temple's outer chamber.
It is associated with Stela 1 and its altar.
Calakmul is one of the richest sites of built structures in the entire Mayan region.
The site contains 117 steles, the highest concentration of the region.
Most of them are paired pairs representing kings and their wives.
However, since these stelae were carved in soft limestone, most are too eroded to be interpreted.
In addition, many elaborate murals have been discovered in Calakmul.
Among the items offered for sale, textiles and needles were also represented.
These murals also included glyphs depicting the illustrated actions.
This provides archaeologists with valuable documentation of the dynamism of Mayan markets.
But this vanished world was undeniably a world of dynamism and growth.
Another very beneficial resource for understanding the Mayas of Calakmul is represented in archaeological remains by ceramics.
The composition of ceramic materials makes it possible to identify the region or, more precisely, the political system that produced them.
Stela 1 is associated with an altar and located near structure 8.
Stela 8 represents the celebration of a ceremony in the year 593 by Uneh Chan and was erected after his death.
Stele 9 is a thin slate monument dated 662.
The text describes the birth of King Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'and gives him his full royal title.
They represent a royal couple, but the texts are too poorly preserved to reveal their names.
Stele 38 is located at the base of structure 2.
Stele 42 is also located at the base of structure 2.

In December 2003, Modiin merged with the neighboring municipality of Maccabim-Reout.
There are several neighborhoods in Modiin: Haprarim, Givatsi, Buchman, Shimshoni, Kayser ...
It is a modern city with a high standard in terms of urbanism, environment and expansion projects.
The projections make Modiin one of the future big cities of the country with nearly a quarter of a million inhabitants.
This West African country of 1.5 million inhabitants is one of the poorest in the world.
More than 44 per cent of people in developing countries already live in cities.
The city expects to be the fourth largest city in Israel because of its strategic location.
The city was designed for a secular public but is very popular with religious Zionists.
This article describes the characters from the Alabasta saga, a section of the "One Piece" manga.
He was a member of the crew of Gol D. Roger for 3 years and held the position of doctor of the ship.
He helped Roger slow down his incurable illness during the last trip.
He participated in the Battle of Ed War on the Oro Jackson with Silvers Rayleigh against Shiki The Golden Lion.
He was 71 when he met Luffy and 73 years after his return.
Two years later, Crocus speaks with an unknown person with Laboon in the background at Cape Twins.
It was then that Luffy and his companions met Laboon, immediately after returning to the Road of All Perils.
After learning the sad life of the whale, Luffy decides to confront him.
But the prohibited use of this powder means that the surroundings of the target point are deprived of precipitation.
They climbed the ladder until being promoted Frontier Agent, Vivi received the code name of "Miss Wednesday".
They then discover the name of the head of the organization: Sir Crocodile, one of the seven private captains.
In the story, Luffy meets Vivi at the Laboon Bow, but under her code name.
She and Karoo will still be Luffy's companions but will not travel with them.
Nevertheless when the situation requires it, it can use to defend itself two chains of small sharp discs attached to each little finger.
He also wanted to be used by Luffy and Pipo as bait to catch fish.
But, there is worse: the latter two also wanted to eat!
His hairstyle is quite odd, just like that of his wife Terracotta, the leader of the valets at Alubarna Palace.
Two years later, Igaram, Chaka and Pell are trying new clothes for this year's Council of Kings.
He is a terrible swordsman who has been fighting his friend and rival Broggy for 100 years.

Two years later, Dorry and Broggy are still fighting at Little Garden but with fists.
The author reveals in one of his responses to the reader that he is 158 years old.
He no longer knows the reason for his 73466 fights with Dorry, including 73466 draws, but that does not matter.
Unfortunately, being weakened by his fight, he will not be able to do anything.
Only his new friends will be able to avenge the affront Dorry has suffered.
But thanks to the wear of his ax, his companion will only faint.
The author reveals to us in one of his answers to the reader that he is 158 years old and 160 years later.
Currently, he is the ruler of the Cherry Kingdom (former Kingdom of Drum).
Moreover, she seems to know a lot about the "Will of the D."
Unfortunately, his medical gifts seem limited, and Hiluluk was rejected by all the villagers who flee like the plague.
After that, they develop progressively a father / son relationship during visits to sick patients, rarely welcoming.
A little later, Hiluluk learns that the Toubibs 20, the doctors of Wapol, are all sick.
Hiluluk decides to go to the castle as soon as possible, but it is actually a trap set by Wapol.
Kureha wants to fulfill Hiluluk's last wish: that it snow cherry petals.
He reigns over the kingdom of Drum in a tyrannical way and accepts no challenge.
He does not have the stature to run a country and is totally stupid and capricious.
He demands that his men be faithful to him, but in return he has little compassion for them.
He does not hesitate to use them for his own sake at the risk of their lives.
This trait often comes back to the "villains" of "One Piece" (eg Creek or Crow).
He possessed thus an immense means of pressure which allowed him to reign without being disturbed by revolts.
There were just two doctors who did not want to leave, Kureha and Hiluluk.
Nevertheless, Wapol managed to eliminate the latter by giving him a dishonorable trap.
Meanwhile, the inhabitants of his former kingdom abandoned the name of Drum and rebuilt the country on a democratic system.
In the manga, Wapol manages after a year of wandering to find his old kingdom.
When he arrived, he began by massacring the sentries who guarded the coast, then razed a village.

That's when King Cobra arrives and orders Igaram to release the child.
Toto, humiliated, tries to kill himself but the King stops him, saying it was just a children's quarrel.
Vivi and Kohza continue their fight outside, supported by a crowd of amused kids.
Later, mobsters try to kidnap the princess while she plays with her friends.
One of them turned up to retract the princess, but Kohza rattrape et il s'agrippe √† lui.
The mob strikes the young boy a stab in the left eye.
Kohza manages to knock out the hoodlum, and his companions take advantage of it to spin with Vivi.
Luckily, King Cobra and Igaram are in the corner and release Vivi.
Kohza and the other members are cared for at the palace, and the boy develops during his convalescence a friendship with Chakka.
Believing the rumors, Kohza leaves to join the rebel army and becomes even the leader.
It has therefore gained some renown and has therefore surely become highly respected by the population.
Later, Kappa learns the secret of Baroque Works and tries to inform people that the King was the object of a conspiracy.
Long-Eyelashes is a camel that was saved by Luffy and his crew from a giant lizard who wanted to eat it.
After the battle between the crew of Luffy and Baroque Works, Longs-Lashes will have the privilege of joining the brigade of Supers-mallards.
He is a friend of Longs-Lashes and according to the dromedary and the translations of Chopper, he is a pervert.

Father Jean-Joseph Allemand founded the Youth Work that bears his name and still exists.
At the age of 18, in 1790, during the Revolution, Jean-Joseph Allemand announced to his parents that he wanted to become a priest.
For two years he can only wait because there is no more seminary or bishop in Marseille.
At the age of 20, he began his training, helped by three priests from the patronage of the Good Shepherd returned to Marseilles.
One of them, Father Reimonet, welcomes him to his home and secretly takes care of him.
On June 2 of the same year, he was previously ordained a deacon.
He begins his ministry in secrecy and absolute poverty.
With calmer times Jean-Joseph decides to take care of young people despite the contrary opinion of many who believe him incapable.
With the appeasement of the 1800s he comes to organize activities for young people.
It begins with four young people in a maid's room: it's the first "youth work".
Jean-Joseph Allemand defines the mission of his work as the "sanctification of young people".
Wherever you look for this resume for all intuition pedagogical of the priest.
By "sanctification" we mean a path of prayer and Christian life, that is, according to the Gospel.
For Mr. German and his successors therefore, sanctification means an education in the full sense of the term (lat.
by his elders, by the Church and by God, through prayer.
By "young people", Jean-Joseph Allemand presumably refers to what we now call the adolescent.
On the other hand, one might venture to add that the term "young people" at the time also refers to a certain social layer of the population.
But the social fact of recruiting the German work should not be erected as a principle of education.
More broadly, the game institutes new relationships to body and mind.
Prayer, which also involves learning, also occupies the field of education.
In this brief presentation of the pedagogy of the work, it is necessary to add a third important feature.
In fact, the responsibility for education lies not only with adults but also with older adolescents.
It is the birth of contemporary animation, as it is devoted today to pedagogy.
It is the older ones who make the younger ones play.
Teenagers then young adults participate in the education of their cadets.
Education once again is not the work of a teacher but of a community of young people.
In the didactic diagram of the instruction correspond the imitative schema and the dialogue of the education.
Thus the work will never claim a school mission but will offer its activities on children's free time.
Citizens will spend more free time on other activities, such as dining out.
As a reminder, a "gentleman" is an adult who dedicates his commitment to life through his commitment.
In practice they are the camp and activity leaders, so their role is essential.
The work, confessional, is a recognized association of public utility and popular education.
With a modest number of members, the institute is entirely devoted to the works for which it is responsible.
In 2013, the municipality benefited from a classification with the label "resort classified tourism" with four other communes Savoyardes.
Saint-Bon-Tarentaise is bordering six communes, all located in the department of Savoie and in mountain areas.
As such, the two longest terms are shared with Les Allues in the west and Pralognan-la-Vanoise in the east.
The municipality of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise is located in the Vanoise massif in the Alps.
This stream is fed by several sources of altitude, including Merlet lakes and Lake Rateau.
Geologically, the town is located in the geological unit called "Brian√ßonnais area" and the sub-unit of the coal zone.
Finally, it is before Bozel that the regional road 91a leads to the chief town and villages of Courchevel.
The transport time from the station to the station is about 30 minutes (taxi, shuttle Altibus carrier).
Finally, by the air, the town has on its territory an altiport, the altiport of Courchevel.
The station also has its own altiport (IATA code: CVF).
In francoproven√ßal, the graphism of the commune is written "S√® Bon" according to the graph of Conflans.
In 1842, the village experienced a great fire affecting no less than 90 houses.
Finally, used in summer, pastures allowed to drive the herds to a grass of better qualities.
Alpine pastures, cellars and barns were built by the families.
The very first hotel of the village, the "Blue Lake", settles in 1908 and welcomes tourists during the summer period.
Winter tourism is also developing at this time with preparations on the surrounding peaks by mountaineers.
The town of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise belongs to the canton of Mo√ªtiers in the borough of Albertville.
The commune is part of the second legislative district of the department of Savoie, whose Herv√© Gaymard is the deputy since 1997.
A street in the village bears the name of the American city, as well as a red slope of the ski area.
The establishment of a winter sports resort on the town upsets the demographic evolution of the village.
This demographic evolution is considered rather rare for equivalent municipalities in the region, not subject to tourism development.
This strong development has a direct impact on the constitution of the population.
The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods.
The college is the one located in Bozel, Le Bonrieu college which has including a school sports section.
The municipality of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise corresponds to the "Basin 73227: Saint-Bon-Tarentaise", or a single municipality.

Other health-related services include the presence of dentists, physiotherapists and pharmacies.
The town is covered by local radio stations including France Bleu Pays de Savoie, Radio Courchevel ...
Finally, the local television channel TV8 Mont-Blanc broadcasts programs on the Savoie region.
Regularly the show "La Place du Village" exposes the local life of the valley of Tarentaise.
France 3 and its stall France 3 Rh√¥ne-Alpes, can sometimes relate the facts of life of the commune.
The local press is represented by titles like "Le Dauphin√© lib√©r√©" with a local edition, and the weekly "La Savoie".
Inaugurated in December 2015, "Aquamotion" can accommodate up to one thousand people at a time.
This space has been designed to accommodate top athletes in training.

In addition, it has an object listed in the inventory of historical monuments and four listed in the general inventory of cultural heritage.
Saint-Bon-Courchevel has two religious buildings listed in the supplementary inventory of Historic Monuments:
Thus, three additional buildings were classified or entered in the inventory in 2005:
This is the first national park created in France in 1963.
The fauna and flora is preserved and highly diversified.
This park contributed, among other things, to the protection of ibex in the Vanoise massif.
In 2007, no comprehensive inventory of the fauna of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise was completed, particularly in the invertebrate category.
There is no comprehensive inventory of the flora specific to Saint-Bon-Tarentaise, or even the entire national park of Vanoise.

After a trying expedition into the ruins of a city, a woman returns to her individuality.
Germany is supported by Romania, Italy, Hungary and Finland.
The names given to this theater of operation are numerous and vary according to the country.
It is the largest theater of operations of the Second World War and probably all military history.
Yet this is a misinterpretation of history (and probably Smith's writings).
Similarly, Stalin annexed the three Baltic states and forced Romania to cede Bessarabia and the Moldavian regions.
The war must also destroy the Jewish communities in Europe.
Until the last days of the conflict, the Nazi proclamations developed this argument.
This defense dimension of Europe is then not the only one used.
It gradually returned to the west from 1943, until it took place in the Balkans, in Poland, and finally in Germany.
It also enlists, after the liberation or conquest of their countries, troops from Rumania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
The ideological and political reasons are essential motivations to launch the invasion, but must be supplemented by economic reasons.
Political leaders must create incentives and funding so that their military forces can undergo the necessary changes.
Despite its conquests, Germany can not import enough raw materials in 1940 to supply its military industry.
It is estimated that without Soviet deliveries Germany would hardly have been able to attack the Soviet Union even with extremely severe rationing.
The Soviet Union sees economic treaties with Germany as a guarantee against military aggression.
Stalin and his advisers also believe that Germany would not embark on a two-front war.
Until the beginning of the conflict, Stalin thus avoids any initiative that could provoke Adolf Hitler.
And the many partisans hidden in the vast forests of the East destroy the railways.
Thus, the troop is quickly undisciplined, which generates multiple procedures of the German military justice.
Convinced of the Soviet congenital inferiority, Hitler and the officers around him regard the Red Army's operational capabilities as negligible.
However, these offensive returns should not overshadow the immense losses of territory suffered by the Germans and their allies.
On the other hand, most of the inhabitants are left behind at the mercy of the occupier.
However, by the end of the summer, German troops face immense logistical difficulties.
Three months have passed and the Urals are still thousands of kilometers away.
Hitler believes that to break the will of the Russians, the capital must be taken: it will be the operation Typhoon.
To protect their capital, the Soviets throw all their units in front of the German units.
This is the beginning of the Siege of Leningrad that will last 900 days.
The South Army Group pushes towards the Dnieper to the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, advancing through Kharkov, Kursk and Stalino.
On November 21, the Germans take Rostov-on-Don, the gateway to the Caucasus.
The German advance is considerably slowed down by the climate and the fierce resistance of the Red Army.
The early freeze allows vehicles to resume the advance, but men are not equipped for the winter.
The engines of tanks and planes freeze like soldiers.
For the Germans the specter of the Russian retreat becomes obsessing.
The winter of 1941-1942 was particularly harsh, which favored the Soviet troops.
However, some German divisions are trapped in the cities of Demiansk and Kholm, Hitler ordering their refueling by air.
To the south, Stalin is trying to retake Ukraine and block the Southern Army Group against the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.
In addition, the plain terrain is very favorable to motorized units.
The objective is to capture the oil fields of the Caucasus and the important supply route Volga.
The disproportion between objectives and means is impressive but the Reich does not really have a choice.
On June 28, the Southern Army Group launched its offensive following the course of the Don.
His progress is so fast that Hitler decides to divide it into two smaller groups.
Nevertheless, the Germans reach the Volga on August 23 south of Stalingrad.
The oil wells of Maykop were methodically destroyed by the Soviets in their retirement.
The Soviets decide to fix the German attack in the city of Stalingrad.
They launched Operation Uranus on November 12, 1942, disemboweling the Romanian and Hungarian armies.
The Germans have sent all their troops to Stalingrad and have no reserves to counter the Red Army.
The Soviets close the two claws of the pincers on November 22 at Kalatch.
The Soviets mount a simultaneous offensive, called Operation Mars, on the protruding Rjev, which still threatens Moscow.
Some historians believe that Mars is the main operation while Uranus is thought of as a diversion.
The Germans evacuate the salient in February 1943 to shorten their front line.
Parallel to the siege of Stalingrad, on January 13, 1943, the Soviets launch the offensive on Voronezh, which will fall on January 26th.
The Soviets are now attacking the entire south of the German system.
Krasnodar, one of two strongholds in the Caucasus, will fall to the Soviets on 13 February.
Karkhiv fallen, Poltava and the eastern border of the "Reichskommissariat" of Ukraine is only a stride for the Red Army.
In EFFET, Erich von Manstein voiced his opportunity at the extension of recent Russian logistics.
Wild attacks and counterattacks, for Sinyavo, succeed one another, the Germans contain the repeated waves of assault of the Soviet troops.
After the failure of Stalingrad, Adolf Hitler reassigned the planning of the next summer campaign to the supreme command of the Wehrmacht.
There is a lively debate within the German command between the supporters of the assault and those who fear the Russian defenses.
The Soviets have made the bet of a defensive fight.
They believe that the Germans will not resist the reflex to attack during the summer.
The Wehrmacht is now on the defensive throughout the Eastern Front against Soviet counter-offensives.
The same day, the Soviets widen their bridgehead on the Donetz.
The Red Army then launched a series of offensives ranging from north to south.
Despite defeat at Kursk, Germany thinks it has exhausted the Red Army enough to prevent it from launching a major offensive.
The Soviet objective is the recovery of the rich industrial basin of Donbass.
In addition, effective German resistance to the Dnieper inflicted heavy losses on Soviet troops.
Marking the culmination of these operations, the city is liberated, but it was looted and razed during the German retreat.
Continuing on their success in Kiev, the Soviets take Fastov, then Zhytomyr, Ovrouch and Korosten.
On January 8, 1944, Kirovograd, near the Dnieper, fell in its turn.
Thus, the recent Soviet advances, which will lead to Brusilov, erase all the results of the previous German counter-offensives.
From now on, Germany has definitively lost the initiative on the Eastern front.
But, from the month of, the Soviets launch a new offensive and they quickly reach the old Soviet-Polish border of 1939.
Thus, on January 28, the pocket is cordoned off and isolated by the Soviet forces.
The encirclement was predictable but Hitler refused to retreat these units to hold the Dnieper line.
He also considered that the soldiers in the pocket could pierce and even take back Kiev.
At the end of the Battle of Cherkassy on 19 February, the "Kessel" was completely cleared by the Red Army.
Meanwhile, the Soviets began to invade eastern Galicia by encircling Ternopil and cutting the Lviv-Odessa rail link.
Manstein applies an elastic defense tactic against the Soviet units whose supply lines are too stretched.
In March, 20 German divisions are encircled near Kamianets-Podilskyi but they manage to escape without too much loss.
As early as March 11, German and Rumanian troops were forced to retreat to the southern Boug.
On March 13, the Soviets took Kherson and, on March 28, Nikolayev, still insulating the "Kessel" of Crimea.
On March 29, they entered Chernotsy, in Romanian Bessarabia, then Kolomyya, at the foot of the Hungarian Carpathians.
In April, the Red Army took over Odessa and Sevastopol on May 10, resulting in the surrender of Crimea's "Kessel" on the 12th.
In concert with the offensive in the South, the Red Army attacks Center Army Group.
The decline is less important than in the south but Briansk and especially Smolensk are taken again.
This city is the gateway to Moscow, its recovery means that Moscow is definitely out of danger.
The capture of Smolensk on September 25 unbalances the entire German defensive system.
The situation of Germany, already critical, becomes desperate after the Normandy landings in June 1944.
In addition, they accentuate raids on German industries and facilities.
The Soviets, who have ten times more tanks and seven times more planes, disembowel the German lines.
The pierced German front, Minsk, the capital of Belarus, falls on July 3.
At the, German losses are double those of the Soviets.
The Lvov offensive launched on 17 July 1944 quickly routed German forces in western Ukraine.
In Romania, a coup d'etat overthrew the pro-German government and Romanian units joined Soviet units.
In the Karelian isthmus, the Soviets launch a powerful offensive against the Finnish positions on June 9, 1944.
Finns must retreat and redeploy on fortified lines.
The Red Army arrives on the east bank of the Vistula, in front of Warsaw, on September 10th.
On 28 August, the Bulgarian border is reached, the USSR declares war on Bulgaria and invades its territory.
On September 5, the USSR declared war on Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Russia.
The capital, Sofia falls on 9 September without real resistance and Bulgaria turns against Germany.
They nevertheless constitute as many demonstrations of the mastery of the operational art acquired by the Red Army.
They seize the industrial basin of Upper Silesia in late January (liberating Auschwitz) and complete the conquest of East Prussia in April.
These counterattacks, as vain as they are costly, incite the Red Army to protect its flanks, weakened by extended lines of communication.
After another missed counterattack, the Red Army enters Austria on March 30 and takes Vienna on April 13.
The battle begins on April 16 with the capture of the Seelow Hills, the last obstacle on the road to Berlin.
The Red Army is struggling to make its way to the heart of the city on April 30th.

From the beginning, Adolf Hitler mentions a "war of annihilation", a "total war".
The Soviet Union emerged from the conflict as the world's second largest military power and possessed considerable prestige.
On the other hand, it is a country economically broken by the fighting that took place on its soil.
This Eastern bloc will eventually oppose the Western bloc as part of the Cold War.
The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were two states ruled by leaders with absolute power.
It is not pushed by its military institutions, which fear on the contrary to lead a war on two fronts.
In the summer of 1940, his prestige and the authority achieved through his successes was at a maximum.
He is convinced that he is at least as good as professional soldiers.
By the generals' own admission, Hitler, who had no staff experience, was not without a glance.

It is sometimes considered that it is from there that Hitler bets on each conquered kilometer, refusing any withdrawal.
The frustration of Hitler's command is one of the factors that led to the July 1944 coup attempt.
Some have seen the desire to save Austria - Hitler's native country - rather than the Prussian aristocracy.
Completely disconnected from the reality of the field, Hitler always imagines being saved by a miracle victory or a magic weapon.
He commits suicide April 30, 1945 while the Soviets are only a few kilometers from his bunker.
Joseph Stalin bears a heavy responsibility in the disasters of the beginning of the war.
Similarly, the lack of experienced officers explains the disasters suffered at the beginning of the war.
The failure of these attacks shows that the Soviet Union is not ready yet.
The orthodox religion, once persecuted, is used to weld the population around the regime.
The authority of the political commissars is reduced to the benefit of the military hierarchy.
He also ensures that his role in the victory is put forward.
From the first days of the German offensive, many collaborators, often from the Baltic and Slavic populations, appeared.
By the end of 1941, there were hundreds of thousands of defectors among Soviet citizens.
First recruited as auxiliaries under German supervision, these defectors, the "Hiwis", are used in the fight against the partisans.
The huge territorial gains that Germany had acquired in 1941 must be pacified and administered.
For the majority of Soviets, the Nazi invasion is then considered a brutal act without previous provocations.
National liberation movements, however, are viewed with suspicion by Hitler who refuses to support them.
Thus, the brutal policy of Nazi occupation quickly returns the minds of the occupied peoples who join massively the ranks of the partisans.
The anti-Semitism of the local populations was widely exploited and these led to many pogroms.
The increasing industrialization of the massacres led to the adoption of the Final Solution and the creation of extermination camps.
During the three years of the war, about 1.5 million Soviet Jews were killed.
Hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians are executed and millions more die from undernourishment due to German requisitions.
Vadim Erlikam detailed Soviet losses amounting to more than 26.5 million.
The total of 26.5 million does not include the famines of 1946-1947 and the victims of the Soviet repressions.
By comparison, less than 5% of Western prisoners of war did not survive the war.
For its part, the USSR was suspicious of those prisoners who had gone instead of fighting to the death.
The violence of the Soviet Union, although lower than that of Nazi Germany, is still significant.
Immediately after the German attack, the NKVD eliminated tens of thousands of political prisoners in Ukraine and Belarus.
These abuses were cleverly exploited by the German propaganda which announced the worst violence in case of defeat.
This fear caused the escape of 8 million Germans to the west.
The intensity of the conflict is directly related to the industrial mobilization of both nations.
Gradually, the artillery also gains in importance, and becomes a major asset of the Soviets from about 1944.
A massive industrialization under the leadership of Stalin equipped him in heavy industry to make it one of the first industrial powers of the world.
From the beginning of the conflict, the Soviet Union evacuated its industries to the east of its territory, behind the Urals.
Millions of workers are evacuated at the same time and have to work in appalling conditions.
Industrial facilities are spread all over the country, with high concentrations in Ruhr and Silesia.
The two countries fought in total war, with all the efforts turned towards the production of armament.
In spite of the territorial losses, the Soviet industrial production exceeds that of Germany since 1942.
Finally, from 1943, armaments industries are increasingly targeted by Allied bombing.
At the instigation of Fritz Todt and Albert Speer, who rationalized the industrial effort, German production increased in 1944.
To replace the workers who had gone to fight, Germany appealed to foreign labor in a more or less forced way.
The German army combined strengths and weaknesses, making, at the beginning of the war, a sort of "one-shot weapon".
She defeated Polish opponents, Norwegian but mostly French, which strengthened her self-confidence.
Moreover, the actors of the German war economy are looting, by various means, these regions.
From the first days of the conflict, the losses in men and equipment are enormous.
The numerous losses of the year 1941 have a consequence on the continuation of the conflict.
This is by far the bloodiest theater of operation of the war.
Despite the intensity and extent of the conflict on the Eastern Front, its history is still largely unknown in Western Europe.
The cold war has undoubtedly played an important role in this "forgetfulness".
The demonization of the USSR during this period indeed overshadowed its decisive role in the destruction of the Third Reich.

Introduced after the energy crises of the 1970s, the PEN aimed to:
As a result, the PEN was revised so that the price of Canadian oil eventually approached world prices.
Instead, world oil prices jumped up to $ 35 a barrel.
The rationale for the program disappeared when oil prices fell in the early 1980s.
As part of the PEN, Petro-Canada was the nationalized petroleum company, headquartered in Calgary.
Arla Foods is an international cooperative based in Aarhus, Denmark.
According to the International Co-operative Alliance, a cooperative is "a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise".
It is the largest producer of dairy products in Scandinavia.
It is the result of the merger in 2000 of the Swedish dairy cooperative "Arla" and the Danish company "MD Foods".
In 2016, it is ranked seventh largest dairy producer in the world.
Its products are mainly marketed under the brands Arla, Lurpak (butter) and Castello (cheese).
She held several ministerial positions in Stephen Harper's Conservative government from 2006 to 2015.
In addition to English, she is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese.
She holds a BA from the University of Victoria and a MA in Political Science from the University of Alberta.
She has been a communications advisor and policy advisor to the Government of Alberta.
When her party was in opposition, she was the spokesperson for Intergovernmental Affairs from 2004 to 2006.
She is sometimes referred to as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
On February 6, 2006, she was named Minister of the Environment in Stephen Harper's new government.
She is the Minister of the Environment and the head of Parks Canada from February 6, 2006 to January 4, 2007.
In May 2006, she questions the validity of the Kyoto Protocol.
Several environmental groups are asking her to resign while she chairs the United Nations Climate Change Conference.
The last United Nations conference on climate change was held in Copenhagen in December 2009.
On May 14, she announced that Mary Queen of the World Basilica-Cathedral would be recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada.

The character of Melville has inspired many theorists of what has been called the theories of "anti-power".
These thinkers often appropriate the famous sentence of Gilles Deleuze: "Escape, but by fleeing, look for a weapon".
It's about fighting the state machine remotely rather than fighting it directly.
Escape is no longer a simple defection but a new strategy of struggle.
A new international strategy is needed to support global economic progress.
The news has been adapted five times to the cinema under the same title:

The same year, he is also a member of the Senate Youth Information Mission.
German political parties are also constitutionally more powerful than in any other Western country.
In 2011, he was re-elected senator of Paris with 61% of the votes.
He is the spouse of Laurence Abeille, ecologist member of the Val-de-Marne.
The city is served by lines 1 and 4 of the Seoul metro.
The neighboring cities of Anyang are Incheon and Gwangmyeong in the west and Suwon in the southeast.
Ten years after the end of the Korean War, the population of Anyang was overwhelmingly rural.
It has been 63 years since the vast majority of Indians waited for this promise to be fulfilled.
Today, the urban community of Anyang (established in 1973) is among the most densely populated in Korea.
The motto of Anyang is "A city where life is good, proud citizens".
The mayor of the city, Shin Joong-dai himself describes the city of its citizens as a city of hope.
Cod liver oil is a derivative of the liver of cod (fish).
In the past, it was a nutritional supplement commonly given to children for rickets and bone growth problems.
In summary, cod liver oil plays a beneficial role in:
The bad taste of oil is now largely mitigated thanks to the progress in extraction techniques and the filtration process.
In contrast, fish oils are extracted from whole fish bodies during the manufacture of fishmeal.
The advantage of the capsule lies in its neutrality in taste but with the constraint of ingestion.
The advantage of cod liver oil in liquid form is its better bioavailability.
Vitamin A accumulates in the liver, and can reach a concentration sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A.
The risks can be reduced when the oil is filtered, refined or purified.
Risks can therefore be likened to the risks that individual market players face.
Pregnant women are advised to consult a physician before consuming cod liver oil.
Finally, his unpleasant taste has long repelled the people who took it.
He proposes the existence of hydrogen bonds between parallel or antiparallel Œ≤ strands.
The majority of Œ≤ strands are placed side by side and form numerous hydrogen bonds between neighboring strands.
The Œ≤ strands are rarely perfectly parallel, they have a twist because of the chirality of the side chains.
In topological representations, the orientation of the strands is modeled by an arrow pointing towards the C-terminal end.
Adjacent Œ≤ strands can be organized in parallel, antiparallel or mixed way.
A parallel Œ≤ sheet is formed of Œ≤ strands whose N-terminal end is oriented in the same direction.
The dihedral angles of the amino acids involved in a parallel Œ≤ sheet are on average of (œÜ, œà) = (-120 ¬∞, 115 ¬∞).
Recent studies indicate that parallel Œ≤ sheets can associate to form amyloid sequences.
Recent studies indicate that these trends are likely to intensify.
Proline is found at the ends of the strands presumably to avoid aggregation between proteins and amyloid formation.
The Œ≤ strands can also be linked by longer loops that can in some cases contain Œ± helices.
The key Greek structural motif is composed of four adjacent antiparallel Œ≤ strands and their binding loops.
The name of this motif refers to a Greek decorative motif.
This loop can sometimes be assimilated to an Œ± helix, in this case the motif takes the name of Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤.
This motif can be repeated in a protein to form a tertiary structure, frequently observed, called barrel TIM.
This pattern is common and can be found in several structural architectures such as Œ≤ barrels and Œ≤ helices.
Four strand topologies have been identified for boucles loops by Hutchinson.
This pattern is rarely observed, its particular arrangement limits its formation during the folding of proteins.
The first loop Œ® has been identified in the family of aspartic protease.
The structural topology of the Œ≤ sheets indicates the order of the Œ≤-strands of the polypeptide chain linked by hydrogen bonds.
Using a similar system, the Greek key structural pattern has a 4123 topology.
In the barrel Œ≤ form, the component strands are very often subjected to strong torsion.
Lipid A (lpxA) synthesizing enzyme or antifreeze insect proteins are other examples of this structure.
Amyloid Œ≤ in oligomeric form is considered to cause Alzheimer's disease.
Its mountains have helped shape both the political and economic history of the country for centuries.
If they did not do so, the political and economic stability of their country could be jeopardized.
The mountains surround several large basins, or plateaus, on which are located major agricultural and urban centers.
These also prevented access to the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea.
Located in southwestern Asia, Iran has common borders in the north with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.
To the east are Afghanistan to the north and Pakistan to the south.
Iran (Persia) consists of cut mountain ranges surrounding high interior basins.
Central Iran is made up of several closed basins collectively called Central Plateau.
The eastern part of the plateau is covered by two salt deserts, Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut.
Apart from some scattered oases, these deserts are uninhabited.
Most of the plain of Khuzestan is covered with swamps.
The Caspian plain is both longer and narrower.
Harry Bobek, in 1952, proposed a vertical classification of vegetation using the Persian terms:
The other important factor defining the diversity of vegetation is the soil.
In the northwest, winters are cold with heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures in December and January.
Spring and autumn are relatively mild, while summers are hot and dry.
On the plain of Khuzestan, the heat of summer is accompanied by high humidity.
In general, Iran has an arid climate in which most of the relatively low rainfall falls from October to April.
Natural resources: oil, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, manganese, zinc, sulfur.

Contact FM is a French radio station belonging to the group La Voix (Rossel).
It operates in the Hauts-de-France with a studio in Lille (formerly in Tourcoing).
The station began broadcasting its programs in the Ardennes in April 2008.
First called Radio Contact, it was created by Jean Vandecasteele and Didier Rigot in 1982.
This is the beginning of a long difficult period for the station, which was sold to the NRJ group at the end of the 1980s.
The national radio much more powerful on this audience, led Jean Vandecasteele to change format in 1993.
It is at this time that he creates the current format "the music of others before others".
Radio Contact becomes Contact FM, a program entirely devoted to dance music.
This is an innovation that marks the beginning of a new era in programs.
The change of antenna policy is paying off because FM Contact then knows a very big success (source M√©diam√©trie).
The CSA also attributes to him the frequency of Boulogne-sur-Mer in 2005.
On 24 December 2008 at 00:00, three new webradios arrive on the Contact website.
On February 10, 2010, Contact launches a new concept, La Nuit De La Prod!
This show was broadcast live on the mycontact.fr website on video.
May 25, 2012, the CSA validates the purchase of the station by the group The Voice (Rossel)
On April 8, 2014, Contact launched a bouquet of 10 Internet radios in partnership with Radionomy.
This bouquet is available on the radio site as well as mobile applications (iOS + Android).
A new logo and a new visual identity is then proposed to the listeners.
In June 2016, the Contact FM website is getting a new look.
More aesthetic, the dominant color is blue, whereas until now it was orange.
In August 2016, the station earns 60200 additional listeners: with 333 500 listeners / day this is a record audience since 2010.

We still have, from Dom Ceillier, "Apology of the morality of the Fathers against Barbeyrac", 1718, in-quarto.
Il fil ses premi√®res √©tudes au Coll√®ge des J√©suites √† Bar-le-Duc.
Later he was appointed professor in the same monastery and held this position for six years.
Ashraf resigned from his post, to be later named prime minister.
The wisdom of his administration made this monastery prosper in material, spiritual and intellectual terms.
The preparation of a work of such an exhaustive character was made possible thanks to the help that Ceillier received from his colleagues.
From January to May 1794, the columns squared the insurgent territories in Maine-et-Loire, in Loire-Inferior, Vend√©e and Deux-S√®vres.
However, the Vendeans fail at the end of June in front of Nantes while the conquered cities are gradually abandoned.
The other Republican offensives are contained and neither side takes the advantage during the summer.
The other articles concern measures to be taken on the organization of the troops.
The incendiary decrees of the Convention are applied and several massacres are committed.
As a result, the application of the fire and extermination plan is suspended.
On December 12, Carrier announces to Haxo its intention to starve the Vendeans
The idea is rejected, probably out of fear that Republican soldiers will drink it secretly.
Elsewhere, a few scattered groups of Vend√©e soldiers continue to roam the countryside and the repression strikes the insurgent departments.
In the end, the generals Marceau, Kl√©ber and Westermann triumphed over the Vend√©ens during the Galbert Ride.
After a brief stint in the army of the Brest coasts, Marceau left the West to go fight the First Coalition at the borders.
Turreau must therefore end the Vend√©e war; he is close to the Hebertists and the Mayennese are hostile to him.
He has the choice between two methods: the pacification, possibly muscular, and the violent repression.
But this plan is rejected by Turreau, probably by personal opposition.
Kleber gets the approval of representatives Carrier and Vest but they refuse to act.
Kl√©ber was finally transferred on January 9 to the army of the coasts of Brest.
It has at its disposal six divisions east of the Vend√©e, each divided into two columns.
Other troops are garrisoned in the towns surrounding the military Vend√©e.
Larger groups, enough not to be worried by the numbers of the Blues, are formed.
Beginning in February, Vend√©e ambushes slow down the columns, which are sometimes reduced to immobility.
On three occasions, Turreau asks the National Convention to approve its plan.
On February 10, Couthon claims the application of the decree of disarmament of the Vend√©e.
These meet the General at Angers on the 19th of February; the latter makes a good impression.
These measures provoke the hostility of the Vendean patriots and many of them refuse to obey.
But the war dragged on and, in early March, Turreau was ordered to concentrate his forces on the coast.
At the request of the representatives, the twelve columns are reformed into four larger columns.
But the representatives get impatient, and the same day, Francastel and Hentz summon Turreau to finish the war before eight days.
Shortly afterwards, for the first time, a delegation of Vend√©en Republicans was received in Paris.
Arrived in the west in March, representatives on mission- Mathieu Guezno and Jean-Nicolas Topsent- request the departure of Turreau.
On April 9, Turreau wrote to representatives Hentz and Garrau:
After some hesitation, on April 10, in a letter to the committee, Hentz et Francastel declaring to have confidence in Turreau.
For the Committee of Public Safety, the Vend√©e war takes second place.
Turreau then modifies his plans, he ends the columns and builds entrenched camps.
Similarly, the Vendean Republicans never denounce the ravages committed against royalist civilians.
These young volunteers of 1791 are then animated by a true patriotism and a great revolutionary craze.
But many of the new conscripts do not have the revolutionary exaltation of their predecessors and commit themselves above all to touch the pay.
The amalgam between the volunteers and the line troops of the former royal army is then decided.
But in the spring of 1793, one observes within the army a radicalization of the spirits.
The soldiers live in fear of betrayal and sometimes refuse to obey the orders of their officers.
The Hebertists exert real propaganda and work to spread the sans-culotte spirit within the army.
In addition, wheat and bread are lacking in Paris and Vendean peasants are soon denounced as hoarders.
In March 1793, the brewer Santerre raised battalions of volunteers to fight the Vendeans.
However, if they plunder gleefully, their military value is zero and they are almost routinely beaten during the fighting.
Animated by the writings of Jacques-Ren√© H√©bert, the failures of the army increase the hatred of Republican soldiers against their enemies.
But accounts of torture and acts of revenge on isolated soldiers also provoke fear.
In 1794, the army charged with confronting the Vendeans was the Western army; Major General Turreau was his commander-in-chief.
The army is very undisciplined and every general freely interprets the orders received.
The numbers of the army are very fluctuating according to the works of the lieutenant-colonel of Malleray, established in 1914:
According to the work of Pierre Constant, dating from 1992, the numbers are distributed as follows:
However, these numbers are theoretical and only 56 to 73% of the soldiers are on the call.
20 to 25% are registered in hospitals as wounded or sick.
Other absentees include demobilized and mistakenly registered soldiers, deserters and killed men.
The number of Republican soldiers killed during the infernal columns is not known.
Soldiers of the Hellfire Columns sometimes participate in some of the executions.
The Loire-Inferior and Maine-et-Loire are the two French departments where the Terror makes the most victims.
In addition, in Paimboeuf, 162 people are imprisoned, of whom 103 are shot or guillotined.
The repression is also bloody in Maine-et-Loire, led by representatives Nicolas Hentz and Adrien Francastel.
A tannery of human skin is established, 32 people are skinned to make cavalry panties.
The Vend√©e and the Deux-S√®vres are less affected but the repression remains severe.
Several prisoners die in prison or are shot, 128 officially, maybe 400 victims in reality.
Finally, 750 to 800 Vend√©e prisoners are sent to La Rochelle, a few dozen are executed but 510 die of epidemics.
Some testimonies of Republicans or Vendean survivors are however known, as well as stories reported by the oral tradition.
This troop crosses many republican communes and commits few abuses.
Sick, General Duval entrusts the command to adjutant-general Pr√©vignaud.
On January 19th, the division leaves Saint-Maixent and reaches Secondigny.
On January 25, the columns arrive at La Chapelle-Saint-Etienne, which is not burned.
The next day, they go through La Chataigneraie and go on Vouvant who is delivered to the flames.
Fifteen Vend√©ens are captured there weapons in hand and then shot.
The next day, the Republicans besiege the castle of Saint-Sulpice-en-Pareds and 18 Vend√©e prisoners are shot.
The third column is commanded by Brigadier General Louis Grignon.
On January 19, the column pillaged Saint-Clementine, La Coudre and Sanzay, then on the 21st, it reached Argenton-Ch√¢teau.
Chauvin, member of the Supervisory Committee of the municipality of Bressuire:
The next day, the column arrives in Ch√¢teaumur, where Grignon has 10 people executed.
On January 28, a major massacre of men, women and children took place in La Flocelli√®re.
Thousands of innocent men, women and children have been killed.
The city is burned and more than 50 people are still shot in the castle Pouzauges.
Finally, on January 31, Grignon joined General Amey aux Herbiers.
At Boistissandeau Castle, an 84-year-old woman and her two daughters are cut down by five hussars.
In the first days of the campaign, Adjutant-General Lachenay, the second of Grignon, walked with the whole of the division.
On the 25th of January the division is divided into two columns; that of Lachenay walks on Montigny.
On January 26, Lachenay destroyed Saint-Andr√©-sur-S√®vre and massacred its inhabitants including members of the National Guard.
Then he camped at Saint-Mesmin; the events in this town are known thanks to the testimony of the patriotic doctor Barrion.
Looting is committed, a man is murdered and his wife is raped, then two national guards are murdered.
Two days later, a detachment of the column, commanded by Adjutant-General Grammont, was reported to La Meilleraie-Tillay.
On January 31, the column won Le Boup√®re, whose national guard was disarmed by Grignon.
The administrators of the municipality manage to convince Lachenay to spare the population.
The column then goes to Mouchamps where several inhabitants are shot at the castle park Soubise.
Count de Chabot quotes the testimony of a survivor, Jean-Baptiste M√©rit, then eight years old.
On January 21, the column, commanded by Brigadier General Jean-Pierre Boucret leaves Cholet and arrives at La Tessoualle.
From Chatillon-sur-S√®vre, Boucret sent to Turreau 32 pieces of goldsmith's art looted in the city.
The column then goes through La Petite-Boissi√®re and arrives at Saint-Amand-sur-S√®vre on January 25th.
32 defenders are killed in action and 53 are taken and shot.
The column then wins Chantonnay on February 9th, when General Bard takes command.
He went to Doue-la-Fontaine to take the direction of Adjutant-General Carpentier's troops.
On February 18th, the column is on the spot, Boucret falls ill and Carpentier replaces him.
Fifteen women and children are killed in the woods of La Frappini√®re.
On January 21, the column commanded by Brigadier General Jean Alexandre Caffin leaves Cholet and wins Maul√©vrier.
On the 23rd, the Republicans plunder the villages around Maulevrier and Yzernay, and 14 women and girls are shot.
The next day, the column is blocked at Maulevrier, having no carts to convey food.
The next day, the column entirely fire Maul√©vrier where it remains only the church.
On February 8, the column takes part in the battle of Cholet.
The Republicans are routed there, and General Caffin is seriously wounded.
The seventh column becomes the personal guard of General-in-Chief Louis Marie Turreau and accompanies him in his displacements.
Being accountable only to himself with regard to military operations, the actions of Turreau are little known.
His letters sent to the convention, however, allow to know the cities he occupies on certain dates.
On the 21st of January, the column leaves Doue-la-Fontaine, the 24th Turreau occupies Cholet, and stays there until the 31st of January.
On February 9, Turreau won Nantes on the 13th, he wrote from Saumur before returning to Nantes.
On February 26, Turreau, joined by the columns of Cordellier and Duquesnoy, launched an offensive against Charette.
But the encirclement is a failure: the Vendeans, reached to Geneston, manage to flee.
On the 6th of March, Turreau is at Cholet; he completes the destruction of the city and evacuates the population.
On March 18, Turreau is reported to Nantes, then to Les Sables d'Olonne four days later.
On March 29, he was back in Nantes, having tried for several days to reach Charette, to no avail.
Subsequently, it is still reported in May in Doue-la-Fontaine, Saumur and Nantes.
The second goes through Le Voide, La Salle-de-Vihiers, Coss√©-d'Anjou, La Tourlandry and Nuaill√©.
On February 5th, Major General Florent Joseph Duquesnoy resumed command of his division after a period of convalescence.
He leaves Essarts and wins La Roche-sur-Yon, where he stays three days.
On February 8, the column leaves La Roche, crosses Aizenay and wins Palluau.
For a reason that is not known, Turreau and Dusquenoy hate each other.
Turreau then summons Duquesnoy to Doue-la-Fontaine; the column wins the place on February 15th.
Three days later, the column went to Saint-Philbert-de-Bouaine where it made its junction with the troops of General Cordellier.
The column, commanded by Brigadier General √âtienne Cordellier leaves Brissac-Quinc√© on 22 January.
The next day Cordellier also saves Beaulieu, rather patriotic commune, which does not prevent his soldiers from committing numerous looting.
Shortly after, the village is reoccupied by the troops of La Rochejaquelein.
The same day, another detachment of the column wins Melay.
29 women and 23 children are shot, those who breathe are still bayonet.
On January 26, the column reached Jallais and burned the villages around the small town as well as Saint-L√©zin.

On March 12, 56 people were killed in Leppo forest in Puiset-Dor√©.
The next day, the column crosses Montrevault where 72 people are massacred, then she wins Saint-Florent-le-Vieil where she joined Turreau.
Then the column wins La Chapelle-Basse-Mer, where the population is massacred, at least 118 people are killed.
Finally, during the night, the column surprises the commune of Saint-Julien-de-Concelles and massacres its inhabitants.
On the 21st of January, the column, commanded by Brigadier General Joseph Crouzat, the second in Cordellier, left Brissac-Quinc√©.
Then, on January 24th, the column reaches Chemill√© who is spared in exchange for spoils.
But the next day, Stofflet warned, counter-attacked and delivered the battle of Ouleries.
Then, on April 5, they commit fires and massacres in Torfou, Clisson and Montfaucon-Montign√©.
141 inhabitants of Torfou, in total, are massacred by the infernal columns.
In Clisson, about thirty people hidden in the ruins of the castle are massacred.
Subsequently, the shares of the division remain unknown for a long time.
After some difficulties to gather his troops, Brigadier General Jean-Baptiste Moulin leaves Les Ponts-de-C√© on February 24th.
Two days later, the fire column Saint-Laurent-de-la-Plaine and Sainte-Christine, two women, including a countess, were shot.
On the 29th of January, the column reached Cholet; Turreau orders Moulin to stay there.
During the battle, Moulin, wounded commits suicide so as not to be captured by the Vendeans.
On February 26, Huch√©'s division came out of the town and set Mortagne on fire.
According to Huch√©, 500 people are killed at La Gaubreti√®re, both men and women, but this number is exaggerated.
On March 4, she makes an exit to face the forces of Stofflet but the commitment is undecided.
However, if Haxo does not seem to have ordered massacres, it is not the same for some of his subordinates.
The Princ√© forest, near Rouans, is regularly searched by the men of Haxo.
The garrisons of cities also raid the surrounding communes.
In January, in Lege, a military commission shot 64 people during the Leg√© massacre.
", They are shot, January 22, about 20 Vend√©ens are massacred in Frossay.
However the main goal of the Blues is to take back Noirmoutier to prevent the Vendeans to get in touch with the British.
At the beginning of November, the Republican forces concentrate on the army of the Marais, on its three flanks.
Adjutant-general Dutruy left from Les Sables-d'Olonne to the south, adjutant-general Guillem6 attacked from Paimboeuf north, while Haxo marched to the east.
Then on the night of December 5, Aubertin tries to surprise the Vendeans in Beauvoir-sur-Mer, near Noirmoutier.
The losses are only 19 killed for the Blues, while 900 Republican prisoners are delivered.
The Vendeans nevertheless manage to escape and then retreat to Bois-de-C√©n√©.
It was during one of these that Joseph Bara was killed in Jallais on 7 December.
On the 11th, the Vendeans were repulsed before Lege, but they succeeded in storming the camp at Sainte-Florence.
Charette seems to be not very courteous with the one he sees as a rival and he is irritated.
But in Haut-Poitou, Haxo took advantage of Charette's absence to plan the attack on the island of Noirmoutier.
On February 5, Charette and Sapinaud attack Lege and crush the 800 soldiers who guard the city.
Charette then wins the forest of Gralas where he is attacked and beaten on February 25 by Turreau and Cordellier.
Louis Gu√©rin succeeds him at the head of the Paydrets and recognizes Charette for chief.
Charette has only a thousand men and, March 5, he pushes Haxo Viventi√®re in Beaufou.
He then tries to take La Roche-sur-Yon, which he believes defenseless, but is rejected.
Charette then attacks Moutiers-les-Mauxfaits on April 19, which is delivered to looting.
Learning that Charette is in Maul√©vrier, La Rochejaquelein joined him on December 21st.
But the interview is a failure, and the two leaders separate.
Nevertheless, the 600 to 900 Angevins and Haut-Poitevins who had joined Charette immediately abandoned him to join La Rochejaquelein.
However the small troop is beaten and dispersed from January 3 to Cerqueux, by the troops of General Grignon.
The same day, he repels an attack Cordellier Neuvy-en-Mauges.
Then on January 26, he seized Chemill√© and Vezins defended respectively by only 200 and 120 men.
Galvanized by this success, the Vendeans seize then Beaupr√©au then march on Chemill√©.
On the way, more and more peasants join them.
The place is stormed, Caffin is seriously injured and Moulin commits suicide during the fight.
Stofflet renounces you, on February 14, the attack Cordellier √† Beaupr√©au, that Vend√©ens avava abandoned.
But this time, they are pushed back after a long fight.
Grignon, who occupies him, does not even seek to defend the place and orders the retreat which turns into rout.
The Vendeans seize the city, complete the wounded, and massacre the Republican prisoners and patients.
Then it is Argenton who is taken two days later and whose castle is burned.
But Huch√©, stationed at Mortagne-sur-Sevre, attacks and puts the Vendeans on the run.
He is recognized leader of Haut-Poitou while Sapinaud reconstitutes the Catholic and royal army of the Center.
However, the two leaders agree with Stofflet to march on Mortagne-sur-S√®vre on March 25th.
Attacked, the Republicans and the population evacuate the city and win Nantes during the night.
The Vendeans cry out for revenge and defeat the forces of Crouzat three days later at the Battle of Les Ouleries.
Stofflet seems to approve first, then he changes his mind about the advice of Father Bernier.
Charette, Stofflet, Sapinaud and Marigny take an oath, sword high, to assist each other, on pain of death.
On the way, on April 24, they drove the republican troops from Dusirat to Chaudron-en-Mauges.
But Marigny only arrives once the battle is over and the generals quarrel.
Prudent La Roberie, who catches up with him to stop him, is threatened by the High-Poitevin soldiers.
Marigny returns to Haut-Poitou, where he tries, but without success, to take Chantonnay.
Sick, Marigny is captured by soldiers from Stofflet in Combrand on July 10th.
On May 6, Dusirat seized the forest of Vezins, refuge of Stofflet, which the Vendeans only have time to evacuate.
At the end of May, the Vend√©e forces of Charette, Stofflet, Sapinaud meet at Lege.
On May 30, they crush a battalion and then march on Challans which is attacked on June 6.
At the beginning of July, Charette was chased from Lege by Huch√© and Aubertin, then on the 17th, he pushed back a column to Chambodi√®re.
On the other hand, the Terror ends and the military operations decrease.
The refugees are mostly women and children.
Many live in poverty, suffer from illness and are sometimes deported.
In Fontenay-le-Comte, where the population increases by half, refugees are victims of famine.
Little by little, between 1795 and 1797, they can return to their homes.
Even before the end of the infernal columns, some officers have to answer for their conduct.
On May 13, the National Convention suspends Turreau who leaves his post on the 17th.
Generals Robert, Cordellier, Duval, Bard, Joba and Carpantier are also suspended.
July 27 is the fall of Robespierre and, in the weeks that follow, the revolutionary government is dismantled.
The Vendean deputy Maignen is surprised that the generals accused of having the most massacred are still at liberty.
Carrier himself is a witness against Turreau and the generals.
On 29 and 30 September 1794, Turreau, Carpentier, Huch√© and Grignon were charged and imprisoned.
Carrier denies having ordered them and, according to him, he acted in accordance with the orders of the Convention.
Except for Haxo and Duquesnoy, the generals serving in the incendiary columns are mediocre officers.
Bonnaire and Rademacher are excluded from the army in 1794 and 1795 for drunkenness, as well as Huch√© in 1797.
For his part, General Turreau spends a year in prison in Paris.
This new climate is profitable at Hentz, Francastel, Lequinio et aux G√©n√©raux des Colonnes Emprisonn√©s.
In 1803 he was appointed ambassador to the United States, a position he held until 1811.
In 1813 he fought in Bavaria and rallied to the Restoration a year later.
However, contrary to a rumor, Turreau has never participated in a trip to the Vend√©e alongside the Duke of Angouleme.
However, Marshal Davout refuses to use it as a result of his royalist writings.
Turreau dies in 1816; his name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe.

He estimates that the infernal columns have caused the death of a quarter of the Vend√©e population.
In 1847-1862, the socialist Louis Blanc wrote the "History of the French Revolution".
He condemns the Terror and considers that Turreau and Carrier acted in accordance with the Convention.
He is very hostile to whites, Carrier treats half-crazy but mitigates his abuses in comparison with those of the Vendeans.
In 1892-1900, Charles-Louis Chassin deals with columns in "Vend√©e patriot".
Colonnes hell, Turreau, Carrier et Francastel ne sont pas √©voqu√©s.
From 1898 to 1902, Jean Jaur√®s wrote the "Socialist History of the French Revolution".
Georges Pariset breaks with blue historiography in 1920, dealing with Terror and infernal columns.
In 1922-1927, in "The French Revolution", the socialist Albert Mathiez, defender of Robespierre, gives a large part to the massacres of Machecoul.
In the collection "Peoples and Civilizations", published in 1930, Georges Lefebvre barely evokes Turreau and the columns.
The association organizes many gatherings and has many commemorative plaques placed.
In "The Counter-Revolution" published in 1961, Jacques Godechot does not caricature or obscure the events of the Vend√©e war.
Other historians like Georges Bordonove, Andr√© Montagnon and Armel de Wismes are the defenders of the Vend√©e cause.
All the columns did not commit the same ravages, Adrien Carr√© makes the distinction between different generals.
For his part, Patrice Gueniffey considers that the actions of the infernal columns are crimes against humanity.
The specificity of Turreau's actions is viewed differently by historians.
Moreover, they would have been overruled by several of his officers.
According to Jean-Philippe Cenat, the destruction in the Palatinate is not accompanied by a massacre of the civilian population.

Herout (Freedom) is a right-wing Israeli Zionist party, created in 1948.
It will be the most important component of the party that brings together the Israeli rights in 1973, the Likud.
"This article can be read with those devoted to the revisionist party and Likud."
Vladimir Jabotinsky created the revisionist party in 1925 to "revise" Zionism in a more nationalistic sense.
The revisionist movement was organized in the 1930s in several organizations:
After the death of Jabotinsky in 1940, the first three organizations, which recognized his authority, no longer have a common leader.
In 1948, the Irgun was dissolved under pressure from the new Israeli government (the Altalena affair).
The new Israeli government even refuses to speak out on internationally accepted terms of peace.
Menachem Begin then creates the Herout, to regroup the revisionist movement.
The new party absorbs the Revisionist party and the Irgun elders.
Until 1977, Mapai socialists led political coalitions in power.
Herout is therefore in opposition throughout the 1950s.
It is the only Zionist party, right or left, never to be part of government coalitions.
The Mapai slogan at the time was "neither Maki" (Communist Party of Israel) nor "Herut".
Then there is the violent campaign starting in 1952 against "German reparations".
It is a financial agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the State of Israel.
The Israeli government considers this aid essential for Israel.
Strengthening the country's economy is therefore considered crucial.
The Herut denounces in extremely violent terms this agreement, which he considers betraying the memory of the victims of the genocide.
Some radical militants of the Herut will even try to commit attacks against German "donations".
But the left denounces a return to the "terrorist" methods of the Irgun, and the risk of a civil war between Jews.
These negotiations were failures, but a small group of Jews was evacuated.
Kastner had to choose those he evacuated, and therefore also those he was not evacuating.
It is on this basis that Kastner was brought to justice in 1953 by a close relative of the Herut.
First convicted, he was finally cleared on January 15, 1958 by the courts.
But the Herut led a very violent campaign against Mapai, accused of betraying the Jews of Europe.
Kastner is assassinated on March 3, 1957 (before his acquittal) by 3 former Lehi supporters.
Given his campaign, the Herut is held for at least morally responsible by some of the public opinion.
In the late 1950s, the image of Herut is ambiguous.
In the 1960s, the Herut will normalize its tone and practices.
Verbal attacks become less violent, especially after Ben Gurion's retirement in 1963.
In 1965, Herut allied with the Israeli Liberal Party, heir to the Zionists General.
The old centrist movement, the historical ally of the socialists, broke away from them in 1955.
Together, Herut and the Liberal Party form the Gahal Electoral Coalition.
The presence of liberals gives a more moderate image to the Israeli right.
The new alliance will achieve good electoral results, and assert itself as the first opposition force.
The Herut accepts, and will remain in government until 1970, obtaining a new respectability.
He leaves the government out of hostility to the American peace plan, says Rogers plan, that the Israeli government did not reject.
In the early 1970s, the Israeli right is on the rise.
It benefits from the wear of the Socialists, in power within the Yichouv since the 1920s.
It also enjoys the vote of a growing section of Sephardim (Jews from Arab countries).
These Jews were hardly integrated from the 1950s.
The right finally benefits from the new credibility of its great Israel project.
The conviction of the right in this area is thus reinforced.
The ideology of the party (economic liberalism and territorial annexations) is mainly that of the Herut and the former revisionist party.
The Likud thus appears quite widely as the continuation of the revisionist movement of the pre-war period.
In 1977, the new party will win the elections, and put an end to half a century of political domination by the left.
In 1965 and 1969, the Herut appears on a single list with the liberal party, called Gahal list.
Results of the Gahal ‚Üí 1965: 21.3% and 26 seats; 1969: 21.7% and 26 seats.
In the elections of the same year, he obtains 30.2% of the vote and 39 seats.

Napoleon was deported and imprisoned by the British on St. Helena Island, first commanded by Admiral Cockburn and then by Sir Hudson Lowe.
He devotes himself to writing his memoirs that he dictates to Las Cases.
Once settled in Longwood, he avoided going out because Lowe gave the order that the emperor must be everywhere in custody.
At the death of such a great man, one must experience only sadness and deep regret.
Michel Pastoureau argues that this arsenic comes from wallpapers and green-hued hangings that the emperor liked.
The black marble base comes from the marble quarry of Sainte-Luce.
Robust and enduring constitution, he could ride several hours on horseback without experiencing fatigue.
In 1785, he suffers from fever while he is in Auxonne as a lieutenant.
Talleyrand and actress Miss George witnessed seizures that were equated with epilepsy.
Napoleon did not carry his hand in his vest to relieve a pain in the stomach.
The official cause of Napoleon's death was stomach cancer.
In 1955, Louis Marchand's newspaper, Napoleon's valet, was published.
Still according to contemporary descriptions, the wall of the stomach had a lesion of about ten centimeters.
The English reports, they speak of a hole enough to pass a finger (it was the finger of Dr. Rutledge).
Few characters have left as important a trace as Napoleon Bonaparte in French historiography and political thought.
In the middle of the year 1799, the state of France is catastrophic.
The Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, through a series of measures, allows the revolution to settle in time.
Bonaparte will first work to create new institutions, which will continue until today.
Napoleon also decided to pacify certain conflict zones by developing an innovative city policy.
Thus, Pontivy was enlarged and the town of La Roche-sur-Yon was created in 1804.
The prefecture of Vend√©e remains the only city entirely of Napoleonic creation.
The reforms he puts in place are the logical consequence of those already undertaken during the Revolution.
These had already tried the Continental Blockade that Napoleon will implement against the United Kingdom in 1806.
The drafting of a French Civil Code itself had already been undertaken during the Revolution.
Moreover, it stabilizes the political landscape by pacifying the country and thus guarantees the long-term registration of its government.
Thanks to these two treaties, Bonaparte neutralizes the royalist opposition and seems to be part of the revolutionary legacy.
Finally, becoming in turn First Consul, consul for life and then emperor, he ends with the Republic.
This constitution divides the legislative power, which from that moment will lose all influence.
The post of First Consul for life sounds the death knell of the Republic.
He took the opportunity to be crowned Emperor (or rather, to be crowned).
What could be seen as the culmination of a tyrant's project is not.
He is considered at first as the liberator of Europe.
Napoleon is therefore more the continuator than the assassin of the revolution, in spite of the impasse he made on the Republic.
Among these are St. Lucia and Martinique, which have not benefited from the application of the law on the abolition of slavery.
But it seems difficult to combine two opposing principles in the same bill.
At the end of 1801 in Guadeloupe, Captain General Lacrosse particularly concerned the black population hitherto free.
Finally, the black troops revolt, evict Lacrosse and then oppose the army commanded by General Richepance come restore Lacrosse.
The Consulate is essentially a period of pacification and stabilization of France, after the revolutionary decade.
Bonaparte wants to reorganize French society in many areas:
Bonaparte has been operating since the beginning of the Consulate many reforms in education, justice, finance and the administrative system.
Among other reforms, he will begin the work of surveying the French territory.
Napoleon had many monuments erected in Paris, many of them to the glory of the Grand Army and its victories.
The church of the Madeleine should also be a temple to the glory of the Grand Army, as planned in 1805.
In 1812, after the Russian campaign, Napoleon changed his mind to return to the project of a church.
From 1807 to 1825 Napoleon also built the Corinthian-style Brongniart palace to house the Paris Stock Exchange.
He also built the Orsay Palace from 1808 to 1840, where the Council of State is established.
The views of Rivoli, Castiglione et des Pyramides, and the numerous buildings of Paris are still ideal.
He offered the Bourbon Palace a new facade, erected between 1806 and 1810.
During his stay, Bonaparte was admiringly admired for some of the State's husbands, notably Pasquale Paoli, indpendentiste corse, et Mirabeau, r√©volutionnaire mod√©r√©.
He also greatly admired Rousseau, even saying, "Oh!
In the interest of the truth, you should have been immortal!
He later rejected these ideas, Rousseau's ideas proving to be inconsistent with the consular and then imperial system.
He even wrote on a banner stretched over his native house: "Long live the Nation!
He is also grateful to the brothers Robespierre, Augustine and Maximilian, to whom he owes part of his rise to fast rank.
Bonaparte shows more than admiration for great conquerors and emperors.
At the end of his life, Napol√©on received an update from the abbot Vignali network.
Napoleon's interest in Islam seems to be dictated by the context.
With the aim of this rally, everything is done so that the Egyptians who are predominantly Muslim feel valued.
[...] But that would have been good teaching; it must have been for that at least as far as the Euphrates.
The change of religion can be understood perhaps by the immensity of its political results ".
Napoleon Bonaparte maintained an abundant correspondence, partly for private use, but above all important official correspondence.
If this new publication also has a purpose of propaganda, it will be more serious than what had been done until then.
The Fondation Napol√©on has undertaken for a few years a vast undertaking of scientific publication of all the correspondence of the emperor.
The list below gives the names of the 26 legitimate children of Napoleon's brothers and sisters, in order of birth.
Other children, those who died at a very young age or from out-of-wedlock relationships, are not indicated.
Napoleon also had at least two natural children, both of whom had descendants:
After the fall of the Empire, in this generation, there were four male heirs, in order of succession:

Outside football, he has been a lawyer at the Conseil d'√âtat and at the Court of Cassation since 1990.
Born in 1952, he comes from a family of industrialists in the north, specialized in fabrics and cotton.
In 1984, he became chief of staff of Gaston Defferre, who became minister in charge of planning and territorial development.
He left the administration in 1990 to become a lawyer at the Council of State and the Court of Cassation, a partner of Lyon-Caen.
In 1991, he defended the FFF in a lawsuit against the former president of the Girondins of Bordeaux, Claude Bez.
In December 2015, Fr√©d√©ric Thiriez announced that 23 pro leagues had decided to create a world association of leagues.
These fees will amount to nearly ‚Ç¨ 800 million for the period 2016-2020.
For arbitration, the president of the LFP has always been in favor of new technologies.
France was the first country in 2003 to use the auricle system.
On May 5, 1992, the collapse of a tribune of the state of Furiani made 18 dead and 2357 blesses.
Fr√©d√©ric Thiriez launched in 2007 "an ambitious plan for the development of professional football", "Footpro 2012".
The results were not at the rendezvous, except on certain points.
In October 2013, Fr√©d√©ric Thiriez was this time elected for three seasons as President of EPFL.
In February 2016, Fr√©d√©ric Thiriez was named president of the World Association of Professional Football Leagues.
In September 2013, Fr√©d√©ric Thiriez publishes "The football deserves better than that" at the Cherche du Midi editions.
A book in which he "decides to instruct the trial of the football to load and to discharge".
He says that in this book he wants to combat prejudices and misconceptions about football.
He leaves office as President of the League on the following April 15th.
He is the author of the report on French polar research that led to the creation of the Polar Institute.

The development of logic in the Arab-Muslim world is integrated with that of Europe, because of their proximity.
Russia extends to the east of Europe, the Muslim world to the south.
Chinese logic has long been isolated from developments in logic in Europe and in the Arab-Muslim world.
Of the six Indian schools of thought, two relate to logic: Nyaya and Vaisheshika.
It was later, however, that Buddhist philosophy reached its peak with Dignaga and Dharmakirti.
Rigor is a characteristic of Babylonian society that prefigures logical reasoning.
In the same way, the first algorithms written on clay tablets describe sometimes very sophisticated calculations following a very precise diagram.
In the Western world, the foundations of logic that have been formalized by Aristotle and Euclid, persist until our time.
The object of Aristotle's logic is the analysis of the forms of thought that make it possible to construct a coherent philosophical discourse ("logos" in Greek).
Its goal is to found a sufficient logical corpus for mathematics.
The basic elements he calls "ordinary notion" or postulate are specific to mathematics.
They can not claim the generality covered by the logic of Aristotle, which is essentially philosophical.
Ancient Greece also saw another form of logic, the Megarico-Stoic logic, very different in its principles (see Stoicism).
This had been transmitted from ancient Greece through St. Augustine and Plato.
The dialectic consisted of a question-and-answer game, aimed at seeking the truth.
Gerbert d'Aurillac became pope under the name of Sylvester II in 999.
It developed a logic essentially based on the treatises of Aristotle on this theme, grouped in the 'Organon'.
The first pillars of knowledge were the Bible and the Organon, as well as metaphysics and ethics.
The faith in God, the logic and metaphysics of Aristotle were the sources of true knowledge.
If Aristotle's Organon entered espisteme, mathematics was essentially taught in the schools of Abaco.
Mathematics then take a liberty vis-√†-vis the formalism that will only grow.
It is then easy to justify the result by a posteriori verification.
This approach leaves the formalism, but only for a time, that of the search for the solution.
This branch of mathematics extends the work of Greek antiquity on the boundary of a sequel or series.
At that time this concept can only be apprehended using an intuitive approach.
This notion, close to 0 nevertheless allows divisions between them.
This approach is nevertheless too powerful and shows results too important to be refused.
The revolution in logic touches so deeply on philosophy.
This revolution is in a period corresponding to approximately the same moment as the evolution of logic in mathematics.
He wants to understand the world by means of a mathematical representation corresponding to the observation.
A century later Galileo strongly questions the knowledge of his time by his approach to the cosmos.
He has successfully used mathematics to define the basics of dynamics.
He then confronts the heliocentric model of Copernicus with Ptolemy's geocentric model.
This approach seems initially to oppose the contents of the Bible.
As a result, Galileo challenges the foundations of knowledge as Roger Bacon did three centuries earlier.
For lack of evidence, the controversy remains open and he is condemned by the Church.
The Enlightenment sees this discovery as a pillar of knowledge.
It is about dialectical logic, which differs from formal logic as well as from transcendental logic.
Frege lays the foundations of modern logic and defines an entirely formalized language: ideography.
It turns out that these can only be solved with an understanding of the deeper logic.
G√∂del contributes by his theorem of incompleteness and Brouwer by introducing intuitionism.
The logic gains in relativity, the propositions are no longer true or false but also neither true nor false.
Independently of the classical logic develop others, built to answer specific modelizations:
A case of force majeure is an exceptional event that can not be addressed.
In law, the conditions of force majeure evolve according to jurisprudence and doctrine.
Traditionally, the event must be "unpredictable, irresistible and external" to constitute a case of force majeure.
It applies to the areas of contractual, tort and quasi-delictual liability, in both private and public law.
Its application is broad: public law and private law, contractual and delictual liability.
But private law and contract law are threatened on many levels.
It is particularly invoked in labor law, concerning breaches of employment contract.
Classical theory defines force majeure by three criteria, assessed cumulatively: externality, unpredictability and irresistibility.
Only one of the three criteria is put forward, the two others being considered as mere non-essential indices.
It is a flexibility because it is a reinforced obligation of means and not an obligation of result.
In this case it was a man stabbed in the train by another, who presented no apparent danger.
The different chambers of the Court of Cassation did not agree on their definition of force majeure.
The second civil chamber and the social chamber camp on their position.
These dissonances in the definition of force majeure are sources of legal uncertainty.
Plenary, 14-04-2006) on the exemption of a contractual debtor prevented from performing his obligation by illness and in extra-contractual matters (Cass.
Nevertheless, if the jurisprudential definition is standardized, the doctrinal debate is not closed.
In the case of debt, a State may invoke force majeure to suspend payment.
Therefore, the suspension could result in the cancellation of the debt.
Rolls Royce was nationalized in 1971, the aerospace division having long been the largest in the group.
The car division was detached from the group in 1973 and became Rolls-Royce Motors, and Rolls-Royce plc was privatized in 1987.
Rolls-Royce was founded in 1906 by Henry Royce and Charles Rolls.
About half of the aircraft engines used by the Allies during the First World War were made by Rolls-Royce.
In the late 1920s, aircraft engines were the largest part of Rolls-Royce's business.
The latest creation by Henry Royce was the Merlin aircraft engine, which was released in 1935 despite the death of Henry Royce in 1933.
During the post-war period, Rolls-Royce made significant advances in the design and manufacture of gas turbines.
In 1995, the company bought Allison Engine Company from General Motors and absorbed it in 2000.
These cuts are related to the drop in the price of oil, the oil sector being a major customer in the marine industry.
This, combined with the sharp drop in oil prices, boosted economic growth.
Despite the growth of the non-oil sector, oil provides the vast majority of the country's dollar revenues.
A sharp drop in the price of oil, however, provides a rare political opportunity to introduce more carbon pricing.
If the price of a barrel goes down, the oil industry will be hit hard.
Depending on the legal systems the notion of contract does not cover exactly the same things.
Swiss doctrine adds a fourth element with the notion of temporal element of the contract.
Contracts of indefinite duration (CDI) and fixed-term contracts (CDD) coexist since that time.
The social modernization law of 17 January 2002 sought to limit the development of economic redundancy.
The law of 20 December 2004 "social cohesion" has returned to the previous provisions.
Lastly, the existence of subsidized contracts appeared in the late seventies.
Short contracts: employees and their conditions of employment http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/document.asp?reg_id=19&ref_id=16755
The individual employment contract establishes the rights and obligations of an employer and a worker.
It does not have an imposed form and can therefore be concluded orally.
The written form is recommended for the benefit of both parties.
Any special regulations, such as a non-competition clause or the treatment of overtime, must be set in writing.
For a contract of employment to be valid, it must imperatively respect these four essential elements:
The collective labor agreement (CCT) is concluded between workers 'associations and employers' associations.
A standard labor contract (CTT) is a standard act enacted by the Swiss Confederation or the cantons.
These minimum wages apply to the entire industry and can only be waived in favor of the worker.
For English common law an indefinite term of employment was presumed to be valid for one year.
It allows the employer or employee to terminate the employment relationship when they want.
However, from 1959, a number of exceptions and federal laws will come to frame the "At-will" job.
The strike is still banned in China, although sometimes there are stoppages in the companies.
The pay must normally be paid in cash directly to the employee each day or according to a specified date.
The law sets the legal working hours at 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week.
1 hour of rest per day and 1 day of rest per week should be observed.
There is a threshold of annual hours, including overtime, not to be exceeded.
These are usually jobs held by women or young people.
The share of women's employment in total employment is among the lowest in the world.
The statutory weekly working hours are fixed at forty hours under normal working conditions.
‚Ä¢ the number of hours worked in a "normal" week, ie without a day off.
The work week would be only three days, 15 hours a week.
The layout and distribution of working hours within the week are determined by collective agreements or agreements.
The actual daily working scale should in no way exceed twelve hours.
Cameroonian law establishes two types of contracts: the permanent contract (CDI) and the fixed-term contract (CDD).
A quarter of active people are under fixed-term contracts or self-employed.
The permanent contract is reserved for nationals, with the exception of contracts concluded prior to the law.
no-valid-translation
These contracts may include a trial period, provided that it is written.
In Moroccan law, there are three types of employment contract:
The contract of employment of indefinite duration constitutes the general rule it is regarded as the contract of principle.
Regarding the fixed-term employment contract, the labor code is very clear.
Cases of appeal are exhaustively enumerated by law:
In all these cases the fixed-term contract is of a duration equal to the duration of the situation concerned.
This period passed, the contract becomes in any case for an indefinite period.
The contract of indefinite duration: can be verbal or written
Fixed-term contract: must be in writing and include a precise definition of its reason.
The contract must bear the legalized signatures of both parties and be written in two copies, one of which is given to the employee
the expiry date of the term or, in the absence thereof, the minimum period for which it is concluded
the weekly working hours and the place of work
The same is true if there is no indication of the minimum duration of the contract or its term.
These are the mentions that are the essence of this particular type of contract.
Deutsche B√∂rse AG is a German stock trading company.
It manages stock markets, whether they are on equities or derivatives.
As a result, its stock market is in turmoil and the real estate market is experiencing a worrying surge.
It also offers furniture brokerage services and serves as financial intermediary.
The seats should be in Frankfurt and New York.
In 2015, Deutsche B√∂rse acquires the 49.9% stake in STOXX from SIX Swiss Exchange for $ 697 million.
In July 2015, Deutsche B√∂rse acquires 360T, a company with a trading platform dedicated to Forex, for 725 million euros.
In February 2016, Deutsche B√∂rse and LSEG announce their intention to merge.
It employs more than 3,200 people in Europe, the United States and Asia.
It has subsidiaries in Germany, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Spain.
She also has representatives in London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Hong Kong and Dubai.
It is also called "mygale Rosy" or "ara√±a pollito" in Chile.
This maximum size corresponds to females that can live more than fifteen years (or even thirty).
Males live little beyond their sexual maturity, between 3 and 5 years of age.
It should be noted that the color of a pink Chile's mygale can change with age, during its moults.
This animal is insectivorous and captures a wide variety of insects for food.
However, the pain it inflicts is frequently compared to that of a wasp sting.
The moulting of a fungus is an important stage of its growth.
The younger she is, the faster her growth is, and therefore she will enter the moulting period frequently.
But for advanced countries, periods of rapid growth are not the rule, but the exception.
It is at first a period when the mygale stops feeding.
Chilean pinkgum is usually placed on the back to moult.
This species occurs in terrarium and requires a certificate of ability to be maintained.
The Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (the so-called Euratom Treaty) is the founding treaty of the eponymous community.
It was signed in Rome in 1957 together with the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.
But it also comes after the first failure with the European Defense Community (EDC) in 1954.
This failure provoked from 1955 attempts to revive the process of European integration with the Messina Conference.
As early as 1956, a Preparatory Committee prepared a report on the creation of a European Common Market.
The creation of the single European market has facilitated the intensification of intra-European trade.
This committee was headed by Paul-Henri Spaak, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time.
In 1957, the Rome Treaties were signed in Rome.
One established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the other the European Atomic Energy Community (so-called Euratom).
It is important to note that Euratom only has expertise in the field of civil and peaceful nuclear energy.
The missions of the community are defined in Title I on the missions of the Community, which comprises three articles.
It establishes in eight points the conditions necessary for the accomplishment of its mission:
An Economic and Social Council is also created to assist the Commission and the Council.
The first chapter, comprising seven articles, concerns the development of research.
For this it allows the establishment of programs of research and teaching.
It also provides for the control of these programs in order to ensure a uniform development of the different areas of research.
Nevertheless, the powers of the Commission are exercised in the areas set out in the list in Annex I to the Treaty.
That list may, under that same article, be amended by the Commission by a qualified majority vote.
The purpose of the latter is for the recipient to communicate its programs related to the research that is the subject of the application.
The Commission may then formulate a reasoned opinion on these programs.
These opinions are intended to guide research in areas considered to be insufficiently studied.
Chapter 2 concerns the dissemination of knowledge available to the Community.
Section II concerns the dissemination of other knowledge than that available to the Community.
However, there are cases of ex-officio communications to the Commission.
From then on, the depositor is again asked for his agreement.
In case of a new defect of the agreement, the communication is made within 18 months after the filing of the application.
However, the treaty also provides for cases of transmission of knowledge despite the absence of amicable agreement.
Indeed, some searches may, if disclosed, affect the defense of one or more of the Member States.
Such exchanges must, unless authorized, be concluded by the Commission.
The Economic and Social Committee then gives its opinion on these standards after the Commission has asked for them.
The Assembly is then consulted and the Council acts by a qualified majority on this proposal for standards.
Thus, any project for the creation of such an undertaking is submitted to the Commission, which receives opinions on this subject.
After that, the draft is sent to the Council with the reasoned opinion of the Commission.
He also recalls that an enterprise results from the Council's decision.
As a result, practices designed to provide certain users with a privileged position are prohibited.
The Agency has a right of option over ores, source materials and special fissile materials produced in the territories of the Member States.
It has legal personality and financial autonomy.
When the Agency exercises its option right, the producer must offer the agency the ore, raw or fissile material.
It may, however, decide at which stage of the process the product will be offered to the Agency.
The Commission ensures that ores and raw or fissile materials are not misused.
It also ensures that the conditions relating to the procurement and compliance with the agreements reached are respected.
Similarly, surplus material must be deposited with the Agency or with any other deposit that the Commission may control.
The Commission may send inspectors to the territory of the Member States.
They have the right of access to all places on presentation of a document attesting their quality.
If they are refused, a warrant can be obtained from the Court of Justice.
Chapter 8 deals with the ownership of fissionable materials.
Chapter 10 contains the provisions on the external relations of the Community.
Chapter 1 creates four institutions: the Assembly, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice.
The establishment of the Social Council and the Economic Council at the United Nations would mark a huge step in the right direction.
The Assembly and the Court of Justice are two institutions common to the Communities.
Chapter 3 establishes the mode of appointment of members of the Economic and Social Committee.
The treaty also contains amendments to a chapter "general and final provisions".
In March 2007 the Commission carried out an assessment and assessment of the prospects for the future of the Treaty.
His family is of Italian-American origin by the descendants of his father's side (Steve's grandfather was born in Italy).
He continued his studies at Denison University in Granville, Ohio and aspired to become a local radio disc jockey.
He even tried to pass the lawyer's competition, but did not find the motivation.
Shortly after, he became a member of a reputable improv theater troupe in the United States, the "Second City".
The troupe included Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Eugene Levy, Dan Castellaneta and Mike Myers.
For "The Second City", he teaches an improvisation class, where he meets Nancy Walls, who will later become his wife.
In 1991, he made his film debut in "La P'tite Franqueuse" by John Hughes alongside James Belushi.
He married Nancy Walls in 1995 and continued his acting career by chaining auditions for television and film.
Carell also participates in the comedy program "Saturday Night Live", broadcast on NBC.
There he meets Will Ferrell, with whom he will work on several films later.
It was during this shoot that he met Judd Apatow, producer of the film.
Note that before "The Office", he appeared in three "sitcoms" that have not met with public success.
The film was critically successful and received a shower of awards.
In 2013, he again lends his voice to Gru in "Me, ugly and wicked 2".
He is applauded for his performance which makes him unrecognizable to festival-goers.
Despite his favorite status, he does not win the prize for male performance (awarded to Timothy Spall for "Mr.
And is part of the quartet of stars gathered in front of the camera of Adam McKay for the financial drama "".
There he meets Ryan Gosling and his performance earns him a second Golden Globe nomination.
He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign.
During the presidential campaign of 2008, Obama showed that he communicated with talent.
He is married to actress Nancy Walls, met in the troupe "The Second City" since 1995.
The latter worked with her husband on "The Daily Show", "40 years old, always virgin" and "The Office".
From this union were born two children: Elisabeth, born in 2001, and John born in 2004.
In France, Constantin Pappas is the most regular French voice of Steve Carell.
Kidney cancer is a relatively rare cancer, developing from kidney cells.
The incidence is higher and steadily increasing in industrialized countries, partly as a result of improved diagnostic techniques.
Kidney cancer is twice as common in men as in women (sex ratio: 2.1 / 1)
In France, kidney cancer accounts for 2 to 3% of all cancers.
The main risk factors for kidney cancer are tobacco and high blood pressure.
Many kidney cancers are today fortuitous diagnosis on kidney imaging (about 70%).
Other diagnoses include loco-regional signs (blood in the urine or hematuria, pain or lumbar mass) or general signs (fever).
The presence of a paraneoplastic syndrome is frequent, by production, by the tumor, hormonally active components or cytokines.
When kidney cancer is suspected, additional examinations and an extension check should be performed.
The classic triad associating hematuria, lumbar pain and lumbar mass is only found in 10% of cases.
The examination is sufficiently discriminating to lead directly to kidney surgery.
The positive diagnosis of kidney cancer will then be focused on the examination of the specimen.
If it is positive, we will proceed to cancer treatment, which will be performed by surgery or radiotherapy.
It is based essentially on the anatomopathological examination of the surgical excision specimen, the biopsy being of little use.
The anatomo-pathological classification of kidney tumors is the UICC classification.
90% of kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas, divided into different histological types:
At the end of the initial assessment, the extension of the tumor is evaluated according to the 1997 TNM classification.
Metastases are all the more common as the patient is young, especially the lungs, bones, liver, brain.
The management of renal cancers has been the subject of the publication of several recommendations.
Those of the European Association of Urology were updated in 2015.
It can be performed surgically openly or laparoscopically.
The adrenal gland can be left in place or removed at the same time.
Nephrectomy can be radical and complete, or partial to retain part of the normal renal parenchyma.
Initially reserved for kidney cancers on a single kidney, partial nephrectomy has seen its progressively expanded indications.
This lumpectomy can be done by conventional surgery, radiofrequency or cryotherapy.
In the case of a metastatic situation, treatment has long been limited to immunotherapy with interferon alfa and / or interleukin 2.
More recently (2005-2006), anti-angiogenic treatments, opposing the development of neo-angiogenesis, have revolutionized the management of patients.
Compared with interferon alone, bevacizumab-interferon doubles the progression-free survival time.
Bevacizumab obtained its MA in advanced and / or metastatic renal cell cancer on December 14, 2007 (see emea site)
He is also the only one, for the moment, to demonstrate this advantage in terms of overall survival.
The axitinib seems to produce a higher rate of response and progression-free survival than its predecessors.
Girentuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
The treatment of localized kidney cancer is based on surgery.
Several studies have indeed demonstrated the interest of ablation of the primary tumor in this context.

However, the interest of nephrectomy in the metastatic patient has never been compared to antiangiogenic treatments.
Medical treatment only slows the progression of the disease.
In the absence of the possibility of curative treatment, the treatment of metastatic renal cancer is based on medical treatment.

The Ottoman Empire has three armies in the region, each equivalent to an allied army corps.
At the same time, there is an attack on Nablus in the Judean Hills and on the Jordan.
Tens of thousands of prisoners are captured as a result of the fighting.
Allenby uses rolling barrages of artillery to cover the infantry attacks needed for breakthrough.
The irregular forces of the Arab uprising also played an important role in this victory.
The Arab world has played this beneficial role in the past and is able to play it again.
The ancient fortress of Megiddo stands on Tell el Mutesellim (Tel Megiddo), on the Musmus pass near El Lajjun.
It controls the roads to the north and dominates the plain of Armageddon.
In 1918, this plain named plain Esdraelon, has strategic importance.
It connects the Jordan Valley and the Sharon Plain 64 km (40 miles) behind the Ottoman front line.
The powers of the Entente declare war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914.
It again occupies Sinai thus ensuring the safety of the Suez Canal.
In 1916, the Arab uprising against the Ottoman Empire broke out in the Hejaz.
It is led by Hussein ben Ali, Sherif of Mecca.
The Ottoman troops defend Medina, the terminus of the Hijaz railway.
In July 1917, the Emir Faisal and the Bedouin tribes win the battle of Aqaba.
He repels an Ottoman counter-attack attempt at the Battle of Mughar Ridge.
He organizes raids with mounted divisions and infantry in Jordan.
The first attack cut the Hijaz railroad near Amman for some time, and the British troops retreated.
Army Group Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m (Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m translates roughly as "love at first sight") trains the main troops of Palestine.
This army group was initially formed to retake Baghdad captured by the British in March 1917.
He is diverted to Palestine to block the British advance on the verge of capturing Jerusalem.
The commander of the Army Group is the German General Erich von Falkenhayn.
He wants to organize an elastic defense rather than holding positions at all costs.
He is also ready to retreat to shorten his lines of communication and reduce the need for static garrisons.
A retreat also leads to the isolation of troops still present in the south in the Hejaz.
Ottoman troops repel Allenby's attempts to advance through Jordan.
In the Caucasus, Ottoman troops captured Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia allowing them to reach the Caspian Sea.
Liman von Sanders intends to reproduce the defense made on the peninsula of Gallipoli to destroy the British invasion of Palestine.
However, some commanders are worried about an attack on the Palestine front.
In the summer of 1918, General Allenby's forces were restored.
A British yeomanry regiment is integrated into five of their six brigades.
His army receives British support through the port of Aqaba.
These soldiers are commanded by Jaafar Pasha, a former Ottoman officer sent to Egypt to lead a rebellion against the British.
Meanwhile, irregular Arab troops attack the Hijaz railway from Aba-el-Lissan to Aqaba.
These troops are often accompanied by TE Lawrence and other British liaison officers.
This action blocks the railway line for a month and stops the Ottoman operations around Medina.
The strategic movement is carried out by the Desert Mounted Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Henry Chauvel.
These communication points are within the range of 97 km (60 miles) of the cavalry.
This capture is a prerequisite for the capture of Salt and Amman by Chaytor's forces.
Surprise, speed and concentration of troops are key elements in Allenby's planned military operations.
The secret is an essential factor as it had been during the battle of Beersheba the year before.
A fear of the British is a withdrawal of Ottoman troops from the coastal area, making the attack useless.
Dummy camps are built, a hotel in Jerusalem is ostensibly requisitioned to become the headquarters of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.
They capture and destroy the Mudawara station and cut the Hijaz railway line.
They then mount a reconnaissance near Amman and disperse documents and supplies as proof of their passage.
Lawrence sends agents to purchase large quantities of forage in this same area.
Allenby's intoxication attempts did not significantly alter the location of Liman von Sanders' forces.
Attempts into intoxication would have failed without the air supremacy of the Entente forces in Palestine and Jordan.
In the weeks leading up to the Megiddo attack, the air activity of the Ottomans and Germans declined significantly.
The last week of August, this number of crossing drops to 18, then to 4 during the next three weeks of September.
During the 18 days preceding the battle, only two or three German planes were able to fly.
He is forced to spread his forces evenly over the entire length of the forehead.
He places most of his fighting forces in the front line.
The only operational reserves of the Ottoman armies are two German regiments and two under-strength cavalry divisions.
General Allenby orders Lawrence to disrupt communications around Deraa for a week.
For his part, Lawrence does not immediately want a major uprising in the region.
However, to ward off possible Ottoman reprisals, a growing number of local tribes spontaneously take up arms.
The Ottomans responded by sending Al-Afuleh's garrison to reinforce Daraa.
Once this position is taken, roads can be built to connect British road networks to newly captured networks.
Just before the attack, an Indian deserter warns the Ottomans about the impending attack.
Whenever they spot a movement on the ground, they bomb the airfield.
Each pair of aircraft is raised every two hours, strafing the German hangars before they leave.
At dawn on September 20, 1918, the Desert Mounted Corps secures the Mount Carmel defiles.
In the afternoon, a brigade of the Australian Rally Division occupies Jenin and captures many retired Ottomans.
The RAF is conducting a bombing that destroys the entire column.
The abandoned vehicles and equipment extend for 9.7 km (6 miles).
Numerous Ottoman soldiers are killed, the survivors are dispersed without a leader.
Lawrence later writes that "the RAF lost four killed.
Liman von Sanders deploys a rearguard to hold Samakh on Lake Tiberias.
This city must become the center of an Ottoman defensive line extending from the Hula Valley to Daraa.
This victory definitely pierces the Ottoman line and leads to the end of Sharon's battle.
On the same day, Chaytor's Force advanced across the Jordan to capture Salt.
They are attacked by heavy air means that cause many casualties and a lot of disorganization.
Many Ottoman soldiers flee into the desert, but many thousands keep their coherence.
Allenby orders his cavalry to cross the Jordan, to capture Daraa and Damascus.
Ottoman troops during their retreat commit several atrocities on hostile Arab villages.
On September 30, the Australians blockade the Damascus garrison trying to retreat through the Barada Gorge.
Djemal Pasha fled, having failed to instil resistance within the garrison.
Kemal holds his positions until October 31, date of the signing of the armistice of Moudros.
Such a complete victory has rarely been seen in the entire history of the war. "
The battle of Megiddo is "brilliant in execution as in its conception".
Edward Ericson, a specialist historian of the Ottoman army, writes later:
It has become clear to all that the Turks can not continue the war.
Despite great victories in Armenia and Azerbaijan, Turkey is now indefensible, without immediate military resources.
Battle honors for the Sharon and Nablus subsidiary battles are also awarded to fighting troops.
The Bah√°'√≠ Faith has, in 1918 as today, its administrative and spiritual center in the vicinity of Haifa.
He is ennobled by the British Empire but he will never use his title.
Toni, a ten-year-old friend of John, also sings on the latest songs from the album.
This error has been corrected in the re-editions that followed.
Perseverance in error does not correct the error, it only aggravates it.
On the cover, we can also read "To Clara", the album is dedicated to the daughter of his friend Flea, named Clara.
At the time, he said of her that she was "the strongest person he has ever met".
The kshatriyas are the different castes that directed, controlled, protected the lands of India and its civilization.
"Kshatra", in Sanskrit, is a derived form that means "dominion, power, government" of the root kshi "to reign, govern, possess".
At the beginning of Indian civilization, the warrior was called "RƒÅjanya" rather than Kshatriya.
This term was formed from the adjective form "RƒÅjan" meaning "governor", from the root "RƒÅj".
To compare with the Latin "rex", the French regent, the Italian regina, the German "reich" and the Hindi ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ rƒÅjƒÅ.
The origins of this caste are as mysterious as the history of India.
The Vedas and other literary works (MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Ramayana ...) evoke mythical lineages (solar line, lunar ...).
Historically, many reigns have emerged from members of other non-Hindu castes or conquerors.
The term Khatri (or Khatris) is the name used in Sikhism.
This Punjabi word means caste dependent on the Hindu system of castes (varna).
Nevertheless with time some of the members of this statute have become traders.
This caste centuries ago was supposed to defend the Hindu religion and its precepts.
Sikhs reject the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcastes and are for the equality of humans.
The Khatris, who are Sikhs, have migrated throughout India even though they remain concentrated in eastern Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.
Today many businessmen are from the khatri caste.
The Kshatriyas castes represent the most glorious castes from the historical point of view.
On the other side, the Rajputs, Kurus, Panchalas, Kosalas, Matsyas, Magadhas, Chedis, Yadus, Kambojas, Gandharaas, Kekayas, Mauryas, Guptas, Chalukyas, Marathas etc.
The kashtriyas have always occupied, until recently, the first place in Indian civilization.
"People governed by an Aryan are guided by divine grace."
"Prince Rama of Ayodhya is presented in the Ramayana as the archetype of the perfect Aryan."
"An Aryan who worked for the equality of all, who was loved by all."
We suppose then that they are the descendants of the Indo-Scythian "Sakas" tribes.
These are the kshatriyas of southern India, especially Kerala descendants of the Serpents dynasty named Nagavansham.
About 40% of the total population of Bali is Kshatriya.
In fact, the Yemeni population is larger than the total population of the six GCC states.
Balinese Hinduism has a caste system and is heavily influenced by the Vedas.
The Diocese of the French Armies is the military ordinariat for France.
In this way, priest chaplains appear who, under the direction of bishops, will form the first military chaplaincy.
The law of 8 July 1880 is still the legal basis of the Catholic, Protestant, Israeli and Muslim chaplaincies of the French armies.
In 1270, King Louis IX embarked at Aigues-Mortes for the last crusade.
We know by Joinville, who does not name, that many chaplains accompanied the king.
Indeed, a late ban made it clear that the Eucharist should not be carried away or distributed at sea.
The religious service consists of the Sunday Mass which is only allowed when the galleys are in port.
They are then allowed to temporarily leave their benches to go to communion, but keep their balls and chains on their feet.
Under all the Old Regime arises the problem of the recruitment of naval chaplains.
In Toulon, the fate of the seminary erected on October 31, 1685 will be happier.
The chaplaincy of the navy is officially reborn with the ordinances of 1816.
But despite the benefits offered, including high pay, equivalent to that of a lieutenant, recruitment is difficult.
Dioceses have a shortage of clergy, which makes it difficult to detach priests.
At the head is the great chaplain of the land and sea armies who delegates his spiritual powers.
The chaplains reappeared during the First World War, especially in the Mediterranean, during the Battle of the Dardanelles.
only schools have an assigned priest, who does not reside there.
Depending on their assignments, some will continue to serve in the Free French Naval Forces.
After the war, the naval chaplaincy officially retains the right to exist.
Although the air force was created in 1927, air chaplaincy was not instituted until 1939.
In January 1940, new posts were created in North Africa, then in French West Africa and the Levant.
Colonel Pierra is responsible for all matters falling under this new statute.
The armistice of June 22, 1940 demobilizes most chaplains and only 4 of them remain in the frames.
New positions are created based on the training courses maintained.
At the end of 1941 there were 22 chaplains (12 in Metropolitan France) and 25 in 1942.
Within the limits set by the necessities of service, chaplains have the complete freedom of their apostolate.
They are at the origin of circles of study, of road clans and found the scouting of the air.
Throughout the Second World War, chaplains will remain attached, like those of the Navy, to the formations they served originally.
Chaplains are seen in London, Overseas, and even in Russia, with the Normandy-Niemen Regiment.
On the other hand, in France the chaplaincy was attached in 1943 to the central service of social works of the air.
This attachment to a territorial organization is detrimental to the chaplains who can no longer follow the passive defense units.
During the decolonization, the chaplains of the air participate in the campaigns of Indochina and Algeria.
South ecclesiastical plan, he was ratified in 1953 at the vicariat aux arm√©es fran√ßaises.
In 1959, there were 24 military chaplains, 46 territorial chaplains and 57 volunteer chaplains.
Founded in April 1959 on the initiative of Father Raoul Wagner, chaplain of the school of officers of the National Gendarmerie of Melun.
The chaplains then wear the gendarmes' uniform and are administered by the weapon.
In 1967, the Vicariat aux Arm√©es fran√ßaises devient independently of the Archbishop of Paris.
Pour l'ordin√†ria fran√ßais, where he adopts the names of dioceses aux arm√©es et d'√©v√™que aux arm√©es.
Bishop of the Armies was a title of the great chaplain of France who appointed the chaplains of the armies of the king.
The Catholic chaplaincy of the French armies is governed simultaneously by French law and the law of the Church.
The decree of 16 March 2005 determines the status of military chaplains.
Given its objectives and its missions, the Catholic military chaplaincy presents an organization adapted to that of the armies.
Given the growing military and economic power of the country, this turned out to be an intelligent decision.
Military chaplains are distributed by army according to the authorized strength.
The diocese aux Arm√©es fran√ßaises is an ordinary military regime under the apostolic constitution "Spiritual militum curae" on 21 April 1986.
The organization of the diocese is superimposed almost perfectly on the military structure of army chaplaincy.
The bishop of the armies has for cathedral the church Saint Louis des Invalides.
Since September 2014, the diocese has its own seminar in Paris.
Lake Charles is a city in the United States, one of the five largest in Louisiana.
In addition, it has several famous casinos and is home to McNeese State University.
At that time, the area was covered with thick pine forests and bald cypresses.
The Salliers then had their house built on the beach where Lake Charles now stands.
Many of Charles Sallier's descendants are buried at Sallier Cemetery, near St. Patrick's Hospital.
The Rio Hondo, which runs through Lake Charles, was later called a few days ago, a Native American term meaning "Crying Eagle".
After a while, the term was deformed in Calcasieu (the name given to the parish today).
On March 7, 1861, Lake Charles was incorporated under the name of Charleston, Louisiana.
Until the arrival of Goos, a certain Jacob Ryan dominated the wood industry.
Between 1817 and 1855, wood produced from swamp pines and bald cypress trees was the main economic activity.
On March 16, 1867, the city of Charleston, Louisiana became Lake Charles.
Resistance to the abolition of slavery was mixed at Lake Charles and considered secondary to commercial interests.
The community was eventually involved in the war, and young men from local families served the Confederate States of America.
After the American Civil War, Lake Charles became a major city in the wood industry.
This is mainly due to the introduction and innovative use of advertising methods by a certain J.B. Watkins.
The courthouse of 1890 was destroyed during the "Great Fire of 1910".
The historic court house at Calcasieu Parish was demolished in 1912.
Two months later, the old parish "Calcasieu Imp√©rial" was split with the current parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Calcasieu.
B. McLaren, President of the North American Land Company and London Woods, England.
After the Second World War, Lake Charles experienced significant industrial development with the petrochemical industry.
Fortunately, the majority of the residents had been evacuated and no one was killed.
The city is located on the banks of the Calcasieu River in southwestern Louisiana, near the Charles and Prien lakes.
It has a port on a deep-water canal leading to the Gulf of Mexico.
The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.06.
Families are broken up, homes destroyed, livelihoods destroyed.
For every 100 women aged 18 and over, there were 87.0 males.
Males had an average income of US $ 33,005 versus US $ 21,041 for women.
Note: Since Hurricane Katrina, city officials estimate that the population has increased by 10-15%.
The elementary public schools are the best schools in the state of Louisiana.
Lake Charles is home to McNeese State University, a public university system of Louisiana schools.
This is true in the American system, in which public and private universities coexist harmoniously.
However, there is a large number of Protestants such as Baptists or Anglicans.
And finally, in small numbers, Jews, some Muslims and some Atheists.
The city is located on "Interstate 10", in addition to "Interstate 210" which serves the south of the city.
Interstate 210 is a loop that gives access to "interstate highway" throughout the city.
Highway 171 "are other axes connecting Lake Charles to nearby towns.
Air service is provided by the Charles Lake Regional Airport, located south of the city.
Claire Chennault, the famous aviator who commanded the Flying Tigers fighting fleet during the Second World War.
The sea canal crosses "the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway" north of Lake Calcasieu.
Many people are employed in petrochemical refineries west of the city and Lake Charles, particularly in Westlake.
It has facilities for the reception, storage, and regazification of LNG.
Chennault Airport hosted "the EADS Airoframe Services", which serves aircraft.
Boeing had an operation before the company left the airport in 1970.
Lake Charles suffered significant damage from Hurricane Rita, which struck the city early on September 24, 2005.
Evacuees were asked not to return within 48 hours because of wind and flood damage.
The city's power supply suffered major damage, and some areas were reconnected only three weeks later.
Many residences and apartments had to be condemned, temporarily or not, because of the proliferation of molds.
The name of the casino is L'Auberge du Lac Resort, which shows the French heritage of the region.
It employs more than 2,000 people, and several stars come to make shows.
An important part of this region in southwestern Louisiana is Cajun culture.
People carry their French heritage by cooking Cajun food that comes from French cuisine.
To see a more detailed article of regional food, visit Cajun cuisine.
Since Charles Lake is located in Louisiana, many of the region's seniors speak Cajun French, similar to standard French.
However, most younger generations no longer speak French.
However, in recent years there seems to be a certain revival in its favor.
Prehistory in Greenland is a succession of waves of immigration from the North American islands.
Archeology can only give approximate periods for these different cultures.
Around-2500 took place the first wave of migration of Amerindians to Greenland.
Their territory extended from Thule District in the north to Nanortalik District in the south.
On the east side, from the southern tip of the island to Scoresby Bay to the north.
It seems that a fairly large number of people have occupied this rich coastal region of Greenland.
They left traces of hunting camps, particularly in Disko Bay and at Qaja, near Jakobshavn Fjord (Ilulissat).
These tracks show that their livelihood was mainly caribou and small marine mammals.
Archaeological excavations have demonstrated that they are exploiting all available resources.
Bones of at least 45 vertebrate species and remains of molluscs have been found.
Stones were surely the raw material of exchange between Saqqaquiens.
They disappeared around 800 and were replaced by Independence Group II.
In Northern Greenland and Ellesmere Island, members of Independence I appear to have hunted primarily muskox.
A space for four to six people was available in each tent.
These small tent villages thus included about 20 to 30 residents.
The living conditions of this culture were very similar to those described for the Independence I culture.
It is only in spear points and other stone tools that a noticeable difference is noticed.
Around 800, another culture is moving to Greenland: the Dorset culture.
He gave the name of Dorset to this new culture still unknown at this time (1924).
Then they had to spend the autumn in semi-underground houses waiting for the ice to form.
It was the end of the "Tuniit", the name given to the Dorset by the Thule people who replaced them.
Descendants of the Vikings lived in Greenland for several centuries in the Middle Ages, before the arrival of the Inuit.
These rocks, which he named "Gunnbjarnarsker" (Gunnbj√∂rn Rocks), are probably located near Angmagsalik.
He returned to Iceland three years later to convince other settlers to accompany him to Greenland.
A new expedition then left Iceland in 985 with 25 ships.
All the settlements founded in Greenland will be almost identical to their home country of Iceland.
Thus, until its disappearance, this colony remains radically European, immediately adopting all the cultural, clothing and other evolutions of the metropolis.
Like the Vikings of Norway and the other Atlantic colonies, the settlers are peasants who practice mainly breeding.
Only the richest farmers continue to raise cows, especially for their milk.
The most important farms, such as Erik's in Brattahlid or the bishop's in Gardhar, have more than one hundred cows.
There is, however, no vestige of farmyard animals in the establishments.
This theory on the food of the Vikings of Greenland is not unanimous.
Else Rosedahl states that "the settlers also exploited the rich resources of fish, whales and whales".
Despite the poverty of the colony, prestigious buildings have been built.
Archaeological evidence is extremely poor, with remains found only at Anse aux Meadows.
In 1000, Leif the Lucky, son of Erik, bought the boat of Bjarni and went in search of new ground.
His brother Thorvald spent the next winter in the "huts of Leif" ("Leifsbu√∞ir") and then explored the region.
In 1005 Thorfinn Karlsefni, son-in-law of Eirik, took about sixty men to colonize the region explored by Leif.
With the disappearance of the western settlement, the settlers lost access to their main high-value exports.
It is therefore necessary to present several different points of view in this chapter.
Kirsten Seaver had earlier disputed some of the most commonly accepted points about the disappearance of Norwegian settlements in Greenland.
The absence of personal effects on these sites would suggest that the Vikings simply left.
Their occupation, however, lasted more than five centuries, that is to say as much as the post-Columbian European occupation of the rest of America.
It is probably at this time that they learn from the Dorset Culture the construction of "igloos".
Inuit have an obvious advantage, as their hunting techniques are more elaborate.
However, they survived this difficult period, unlike the descendants of the Vikings.
When in 1578 the English explorer John Davis reached Greenland, he found only Inuit.
In 1721, the Danes and Norwegians rediscover the island, the Inuit have been the only inhabitants of Greenland for several centuries already.
In 1536, the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway merged into one entity.
It was at this point that Greenland began to be seen as a Danish dependency, and no longer Norwegian.
During the 1660s, the polar bear was even added to the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Denmark.
In addition to these religious elements, Greenland was also interesting from the point of view of the fishing economy (fisheries, whaling industry).
Finally, this expedition can be seen as one of the manifestations of Danish colonization attempts in America.
In any case, Greenland gradually opened up to the Danish trading companies and closed for those of other countries.
The new colony was centered around Godth√•b, which literally means "Good Hope," on the southwestern coast of the island.
Some of the Inuit living near the trading centers were converted to Christianity.
However in winter, isolated supplies from Europe, they tend to find a little their traditions of hunter and fisherman.
In 1734, the trader and landowner Jacob Severin put his hand on the trade and the infrastructures of Greenland.
Danish law, on the other hand, still applied only to settlers.
During the same period, the eastern coast of the island was gradually depopulated because of growing economic difficulties.
In 1911, two assemblies will be created, one for the North and the other for the South.
It was not until 1951 that these two assemblies were united and that Greenland was thus endowed with a parliament.
The Norwegian Government, faced with a fait accompli, supported this occupation after the fact.
In 1933, the Permanent Court of International Justice was called upon to decide and pronounced in favor of Denmark.
During the Second World War, Denmark was occupied by Germany on April 9, 1940.
This treaty gave the United States the right to establish military bases in Greenland.
The Germans also tried several times to use the island to establish weather stations, but these attempts failed.
It has also become a base for observing the possible use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would have passed over the Arctic.
Since then, this base has become a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlanders.
In 1950, the Danish trade monopoly was abolished and Greenland was open to free trade.
The head of the administration will now be a Danish appointed by Copenhagen and a parliament will be democratically elected.
The entry into force of the new Danish constitution on 5 June 1953 changed the status of Greenland.
It was no longer a colony, but became a Danish province ("amt"), consisting of eighteen municipalities.
Since then, Greenland has also sent two democratically elected deputies to the Danish Parliament, the Folketing.
On August 30, 1955, finally, a Ministry of Greenland was created in Denmark.
Greenland's openness to free trade did not, however, have any effect on Inuit culture.
Many of them spoke of cultural colonization, against which they had until then been protected by the isolation of the island.
During the first decades of reigning the second world war, the Inuit culture was effectively catapulted brutally in the era industrielle.
In 1975, a Danish-Greenland Joint Committee was created and three years later the Danish Parliament granted this autonomy.
It came into force the following year, after the Greenlanders had approved this status by referendum on 17 January 1979.
Place names in Danish have been replaced by Inuit names.
Thus, Godth√•b, its capital and center of Danish civilization on the island, became Nuuk.
In 1985, Greenland adopted its own flag, using the colors of the Danish flag.
Even international relations, which were once the responsibility of Denmark, are now left partly to the local government.
Local governments must be allowed to take responsibility for the economic performance of their country.
He was also a founding member of the Arctic Council in 1996.
The United States would like to be able to install a station in Greenland for its missile defense shield.
He settled in Rome in 1899 where he worked as an employee.
In 1910, the sign manifested to the futuristic painting with Marinetti, Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo and Carlo Carr√†.
In 1913, he married Jeanne (1897-1992), the daughter of the poet Paul Fort.
After 1920, he devoted himself especially to sacred art and mosaic.
In 1921 he published a book entitled "From cubism to classicism".
LONDON - I published in 1995 a book called The World After Communism.
In 1922, the d√©cor of frescoes joins a duke du Castello di Montegufoni at the request of Osbert Sitwell, owner of the land.
In the 1920s, he divided his time between Paris and Rome.
In 1956, he opened in Paris the School of Italian Art with Gio Colucci.
It is the only state in the European Union that did not experience the recession during the 2008-2010 economic crisis.
The industry was weak, and the development of the economy depended on foreign capital.
In general the standard of living was low, and there was a stagnation of the economy.
During the Second World War, Poland suffered heavy losses.
The ravages of war reduced the national assets by 38% compared to 1939.
Poland has steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization throughout the 1990s with mixed results.
These impressive results are due to a sharp rise in exports, investment and industrial production.
Some family farms extract crude oil by artisanal means in the vicinity of Lesko (in Ropienka in particular).
The other industrial areas are the port center of Gda≈Ñsk-Gdynia, Lower Silesia, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Krakow and Warsaw.
Coal and lignite power plants provide 94% of the country's electricity production.
Investments in coal-based electricity generation have declined every year since 2005.
With the collapse of the ruble-based Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in 1991, Poland sharply reoriented its trade.
Therefore, a deficit is expected but should be considered as positive at this time.
Poland is a member of the World Trade Organization and the European Union.
Should the World Trade Organization have been its main concern?
It applies common external tariffs to goods from other countries (including the United States) of the EU.
Most Polish exports to the United States receive tariff benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences).
Opportunities for trade and investment continue to exist across virtually all sectors.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Poland, founded in 1991 with seven members, now has more than 300 members.
In practice, the implementation of this project encounters a series of difficulties, and no date has been set for its implementation.
In 1971, the Red Cross of North Korea and South Korea considered meetings between divided families.
To this end, a Coordination Commission has been established to establish relations of mutual trust.
In particular, South Korea did not intend to give up the privileged military alliance with the United States.
In addition, the agreement provides for the development of military, economic and cultural exchanges for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
Regular exchanges are also planned between defense officials of both States.
An important part of the agreement is aimed at boosting inter-Korean trade:
This air link is part of the development of tourism exchanges of South Koreans in the Mount Paektu region.
Exchanges of people allow, in addition to tourist travel from South Koreans to the North, the reunion of separated families.
In May 2006, Han Wang-san, president of the South Korean Red Cross, paid a five-day visit to North Korea.
But the nuclear test carried out by North Korea this month seems to be the real one.
However, during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, two national teams were formed.
Runners from North and South participated in a reunification marathon on November 24, 2005.
Exchanges are held in order to reunite the two international federations of taekwondo, Korean national combat sport.
Different obstacles may be likely to hinder inter-Korean rapprochement.
On the merits, there was no real rapprochement.
The overthrow of Sihanouk in 1970 was followed by a period of political chaos.
Cambodia adopts a parliamentary regime comparable to that of the fourth French Republic.
The text also states that Cambodia does not waive its rights to Cochin China.
On January 11, 1953, he dissolved the National Assembly until further notice.
From February 1953, Sihanouk made an international tour, in France and then in the United States, where he pleaded for independence.
On October 17, a convention is signed between France and Cambodia.
On November 8, Norodom Sihanouk made a triumphant return to Phnom Penh and, on November 9, Cambodia's independence was proclaimed.
The Khmers Issarak lay down their arms or leave Cambodian territory in the wake of Vietnamese People's Army troops.
In exchange for the withdrawal of their forces, communist representatives in Geneva wanted a total neutrality of Cambodia and Laos.
This implied the departure of US military forces in these countries.
In fact, Cambodia has already appealed to Washington for military aid on its territory.
The Conference accepts this point despite the strong objections of North Vietnam.
After the Geneva Accords, Sihanouk enjoys the fullness of power.
French troops do not immediately leave Cambodia, whose political situation has yet to stabilize.
His Ngoc Thanh, released from the maquis in September, officially lends his allegiance to the government, but Sihanouk refuses to receive him.
99.8% of voters choose a blank ballot, but voter turnout is disappointing.
Fearing an opposition victory, Sihanouk decides to return to the electoral game himself.
The Sangkum Reastr Niyum won 83% of the vote and all seats in the National Assembly.
The results of the 1955 election are attributed to fraud and intimidation.
In many cases, the results of the vote would have been simply falsified.
In early 1956, the government presented its plan for the country's economy for the next two years.
In 1960, there was a problem with the death of King Norodom Suramarit, father of Sihanouk.
The first years of the Sangkum regime are reflected, in particular retrospectively, golden age.
Until the early 1960s, the popularity of Sihanouk was good.
Arable land was available throughout the country and cities were full of job opportunities.
Exports of raw materials such as rice, rubber or pepper covered the needs for imported products.
The salaries and equipment of the army were supported by American aid.
The health system, although still rudimentary by Western standards, was making considerable progress.
Cases of malaria and infant mortality had decreased in significant ways.
Hundreds of thousands of people, illiterate for decades, were learning to read and felt indebted to government programs.
Sihanouk's foreign policy emerges in the months following the Geneva Conference.
In April 1955, Cambodia participated in the Bandung conference, thus reaffirming its neutrality towards the United States and the USSR.
Through them, each of these two countries ensures him respect for Cambodia's independence and territorial integrity.
Cambodia's relations with the People's Republic of China are based on mutual interests.
Sihanouk expects China to prevent Vietnamese and Thais from acting against Cambodia.
But Sihanouk's balance game between the communist countries and the Western camp is of great concern to the United States.
In 1960, China and Cambodia signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression.
After the Sino-Soviet break, this ardent friendship between Sihanouk and China helps to cool the Cambodian ties with the USSR.
Sihanouk believes that the FARK are Washington's most powerful allies in Cambodia.
The political evolution of Sihanouk causes tensions with Sam Sary, which seems to lean towards an alliance with the United States.
They are in fact subjected at five o'clock by a humiliating harangue, relayed by loudspeakers to the crowd gathered around the palace.
The Part d√©mocrate continu√© de vivoter jusqu'aux √©lections du printemps 1958, he was finally resigned to present candidates.
Pracheachon participates in the ballot, but its candidates face a virulent anti-communist campaign from the Sihanouk apparatus.
Sihanouk publishes a statement aimed at members of the National Assembly for their hostile attitude towards the police.
Sihanouk suspects Sam Sary of taking part, and the former minister must flee.
Sihanouk is trying to normalize relations with South Vietnam by visiting Saigon to President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám.
The suspicions are on South Vietnam, ally of the United States.
Behind this attack but also behind the plot discovered before, Sihanouk sees the hand of the Americans.
These developments, aggravated by Sihanouk's increased suspicions, end up undermining Phnom Penh's relations with Washington.
Meanwhile, Sihanouk, strongly shocked and frightened by the assassination of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám in November 1963, fears to suffer the same fate.
In 1964, a state trading enterprise, the National Import-Export Commission, was created to manage foreign trade.
Successful state monopolies are fragmented and entrusted to the most faithful servants of Sihanouk.
However, most Cambodians were not interested in any of these three groups.
It did not mean they were not worried about government malfeasance and corruption.
However, they felt helpless in the face of these worries and did not see politics as a way out.
Prior to 1967, clashes between the three factions were limited to cities and remained modest.
Nevertheless, day after day, they became more and more vindictive and relentless.
The fight to the death between different movements would become a constant in Cambodian political life until today.
Day-to-day politics can not dominate the regulation that markets need.
In 1965, Sihanouk negotiated an agreement with China and North Vietnam.
Until then, Cambodia closed the eyes on the tactical folds of Vi·ªát C·ªông and North Vietnamese forces on the territory.
The treaty would have allowed them to build permanent military installations.
This reversal of the prince is the consequence of another adjustment to the conditions then prevailing in Asia.
It then became almost impossible to deal with the Chinese because of the crisis associated with the cultural revolution.
Moreover, the North Vietnamese presence in eastern Cambodia has become so important that it destabilizes Cambodia politically and economically.
Lon Nol, leader of the right, became prime minister in October 1966.
Sihanouk then orders that the harvest be under the control of the army.
On March 11, 1967, in the province of Battambang, peasants revolt against requisitions and taxes.
The thesis will then be the interests of several components of Cambodian politics.
After more than a decade of sustained growth, growth faltered and became weaker than population growth.
In poor provinces around Phnom Penh, homeless people also became a critical problem.
To complicate matters, rubber, the country's main source of exports, was suffering from a fall in world prices.
In fact, the main obstacle to progress seemed to be Sihanouk's lack of enthusiasm for solving economic questions.
Small industry, on the other hand, had remained in the private domain and had grown considerably.
The same progress was made in the fields of paper mills, cardboard and wood processing.
Sihanouk persisted in wanting to make Cambodian industry a showcase for the Sangkum.
In fact, Cambodia suffered from the same problems as most developing countries.
Other sociological reasons can also be advanced as causes of these difficulties.
Most of the elites held agriculture and fishing as insignificant.
At the same time, corruption, rarely punished, also broke records.
Critics blamed their hand on all aspects of daily life and its domestic politics.
Nevertheless, keeping his country out of the Vietnam War remains to his credit.
If Cambodia had openly engaged in the camp of one of the belligerents, it is a safe bet that the other would have attacked it.
On March 11, 1969, the United States began bombarding Cambodian territory with the aim of destroying communist bases.
Sihanouk does not protest and, on the contrary, re-establishes diplomatic relations with the United States on June 18 of the same year.
The United States led the international diplomatic response, but their approach was seriously flawed.
Chen Heng, chairman of the assembly, becomes interim head of state.
In the following weeks, the alliance was formed with the Khmer Rouge, under the auspices of the United Front National Kampuchea.
In the urban areas, the middle classes, on the contrary, tend to rejoice at the fall of Sihanouk.
Cambodia lives until 1975 under the sign of civil war.
A pro-Vietnamese regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, was set up in 1979 after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge.
Sihanouk again became head of state in 1993, then again king a few months later during the re-establishment of the monarchy.

It is a salt water lake, surrounded by land cultivated by peasants or exploited for grazing or salt.
It is also an important ecological site and a nesting place for many bird species.
The tectonic, paleoclimatic and geological history of the lake are being studied.
Ecological data is lacking, but work is in progress (sediment studies to understand paleoclimates).
The bottom of the lake is crossed over its entire length by five fault lines oriented north-west south-east.

Fifteen animals (chickens and mice) out of sixteen tested died in less than three days after exposure to the virus.
The virus is not well suited to chicken and some strains of the virus "go crazy furious".
The H5N1 virus is confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Veterinary Administration Bureau.
Other dead birds have been found in the area that has been disinfected.
The H5N1 epizootic of Qinghai Lake has been at the heart of these issues.
Thus HP (highly pathogenic) influenza A viruses appear to be easily and rapidly dispersed in the aquatic environment.
Some fish farms and rice paddies could thus constitute new reservoirs of viruses.

A new weapon of mass destruction called MIDAS is subsequently discovered.
The two major military companies, the USN and the OCU, want to seize it at all costs, and the interplanetary crisis is definitely launched.
The game includes two scenarios, one played with USN and Emma, ‚Äã‚Äãthe other with Kazuki's adoptive sister, Alisa.
With the exception of Kazuki and Ryogo, each scenario has six different playable characters.
MIDAS, acronym for "Matter Irradiation Dissociative Acceleration System", was designed by Emir Klamsky, head of the USN Special Radiation Laboratories.
MIDAS separates protons, neutrons, and electrons in auric radiation to extract energy.
Auric radiation is a great kinetic energy that breaks the molecular bonds of everything that comes in contact with it.
The story of "Front Mission 3" begins when MIDAS was stolen from Dr.'s labs
Several months have passed since the flight, and during this time, the JDF tried to reproduce MIDAS.
The project "Imaginary Number" was launched in Orsha, Ravnui, in present-day Belarus.
The goal of this project was to create superior beings imbuing extraordinary possibilities.
Unfortunately for the "Imaginary Number", they had to be used as tools.
Their participation in "Front Mission 3" is a key element in the progress of the scenario.
This research resulted in the creation and production of the "Imaginary Number".
BAL Gorbovsky was the project leader and later became Ravnui's ambassador to the DHZ.
His security force consists of "Real Number", a less advanced version of "Imaginary Number", led by Liu Hei Fong.

The rest of the wind turbines are gradually put into service until the end of 2012.
STEG is studying the control and introduction of solar energy in Tunisia.
To develop wind and solar energy, STEG created in 2010 a dedicated subsidiary: STEG renewable energies.
In many places, solar and wind energy now compete with fossil fuels.
A cell on the subject had existed at STEG since the late 1970s but was dormant.
STEG maintains relationships with its customers through 38 districts and 90 agencies.

Corruption hinders growth, but weak growth also encourages corruption and limits the effectiveness of governments.
It was already suffering the repercussions of the opening of the Corinth Canal and the growth of Piraeus.
The origins of Andria are uncertain and are legendary in the image of some ancient cities.
Do not we attribute to the mythical Diomedes, hero of the Trojan War, the foundation of the city?

Any first-year medical student knows how John Snow stopped a cholera outbreak in London.
Half of the residents are Americans, the other half are students from more than thirty different nations.
Finally, in case of international economic difficulties, it provides for the possibility of a moratorium.
However, the economic crisis of 1929 that broke out shortly after the signing of the Young Plan led to the liquidation of the repairs.
In 1931, the Hoover moratorium, taken at the initiative of the President of the United States, suspends all inter-governmental debts for one year.
Moreover, the seizure of power by Hitler means that the obligations of the Treaty of Versailles will never be fulfilled.
Owen D. Young is the chair of this committee of experts.
According to the metaphor of Jacques Seydoux, the implementation of the Dawes plan is similar to the construction of a house without a roof.
Indeed, the Dawes plan does not fix the amount of the repairs that Germany owes.
It is therefore essentially a question of how long it will take Germany to pay its debt.
The question of the guarantees to be given by the Allies vis-√†-vis Germany comes quickly.
It was Germany's guarantee that her currency would never be reached by her reparations payments.
It seemed necessary to alleviate all this system and to modify the supervision of the German Railways Company.
Germany strongly urges the removal of the control system and the transfer committee.
We note the absence of experts of Greek, Serbian or Hungarian nationality.
Owen D. Young's role was central to other experts.
At the meeting of the committee is discussed the project to create a Bank of International Settlements (BIS).
It must receive German payments, ensuring the transfer and distribution among creditors.
It must also proceed with the commercialization of the debt according to the possibilities of the financial market.
In financial markets, free market supporters have temporarily lost faith.
First of all, this is a bank that is going to be a merchant bank.
Then, it will lead by its activity of inflation and credit.
The law is however rejected by the Reichstag, then by the referendum.
There is therefore a correlation between German bonds and interallied debts.
Another effect of the Young Plan was to definitively set the sums due by Germany.
The Young Plan entails the abolition of the Reparation Commission.
One third of this sum will then have to be paid without delay while the remainder spreads until 1988.
For this, it was expected that the German government will implement a tax on transport.
The economic crisis due to the collapse of Wall Street comes at the heart of the negotiations.
US banks then begin to withdraw their funds from Europe and especially cancel the credits that made the Young plan viable.
France decides to interrupt its own repayments in the United States if Germany interrupts its own.
At the end of 1932, the settlement of debts following the 1914-1918 war seems over.
This movement led to the creation of a non-market economic sector governed by the code of mutuality.
The adjective "mutual" refers, more specifically, to the reciprocal nature of a right or an obligation.
The cooperative association is not an instinctive group, but an already structured form of life in society.
We can rightly imagine that the first cooperative events were spontaneous: mutual aid ...
Nevertheless, examples of "cooperative prehistory" can be found!
Let's not forget the "artels" of fishermen, hunters and craftsmen of ancient Russia ...
The roots of worker cooperation plunge away, about 150 years in history.
It can be said that it is a workers' response to the consequences of the concentration of capital.
Cooperatives are a response to the "abuses" of capitalism, largely developed during the Industrial Revolution.
The Le Chapelier law of 14 to 17 June 1791 which prohibits the "assemblies of workers and craftsmen".
It was here that the internal types of organization and the stock of dominant doctrines were forged.
Robert Owen (1771-1858) is considered the founding father of the modern cooperative movement.
He successfully implemented his ideas in his "New Lanark" spinning mill in Scotland.
The mutualist movement is non-profit and has created structures without shareholders.
In particular, these reforms have imposed the need for complementary health actors to have sufficient capital to cover potential risks.
A health reform or even a partial pension reform will have to wait a few years.
It was therefore necessary to create reserve funds to comply with the new Solvency doctrine.
Doctor of Chemical Sciences from the University of the Basque Country- "Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea".
For the other prices, we do not speak of "chemical sciences" or "physical sciences".
Graduated from the Faculty of Chemical Sciences of the University of Deusto in San Sebasti√°n.

Incorporates into the Mondrag√≥n Cooperative Group in the period 1989-1991 as an industrial promoter.
Head of the Department of Marketing and External Relations of INASMET for the period 1991-1994.
In 2006 he received the Creu de Sant Jordi, a distinction awarded by the Generalitat of Catalonia.
He leaves his post as President of the Basque Nationalist Party in 2008, and is replaced by I√±igo Urkullu.
The city has since occupied a privileged place in the spirit of the ancient Mesopotamians.
The study of the appearance of the city comes up against the necessity of defining it.
The causes of the appearance of cities, as of "civilization" in general, are debated.
Commercial or military causes are often postulated (desire to protect oneself).
The southern Mesopotamian is the first to reach the urban stage.
It only comes later in the Diyala Valley (Tell Asmar / Eshnunna, Khafadje).
Exceptions are Kurigalzu-Kur, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta or Dur-Sharrukin, all built by a king, for its prosperity.
But we rarely put forward the fact that this is a new city: Mr.
Small towns have also been built or rebuilt in a planned way (Harradum in the Paleo-Babylonian period for example).
There is clearly an opposition between what is inside and what is beyond the walls.
As the first urban civilization with ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia gave the city a prominent place.
We can distinguish three main functions of the city: political, religious and economic.
In fact, since 2003, Putin's main economic policy has been renationalization.
The oldest urban centers present more important places easily identifiable by the monumental size of their buildings.
This ensemble is at historical times the heart of Uruk, its sacred quarter, with the other worship complex, Kullab.
Like most major religious districts of the main Mesopotamian cities, they have a main temple, and a ziggurat.
In some cities, such as Nippur or Babylon, the sacred quarter may be protected by a wall.
Their mere presence is enough to make the city an economic center.
They extend their influence over the surrounding countryside, where they usually have properties.
The political and social organization of the Mesopotamian cities is difficult to grasp in the absence of explicit sources.
As a result, political parties and social organizations have attacked reform efforts.
However, we see the power exercised in the urban space on several levels.
Each family unit is dominated by a leader (male), who exercises patriarchal authority.
At the level of the city, the power is held by several characters or groups.
When urban magistrates appear in the texts, it is often difficult to determine their function.
They can be more than one per city, and sometimes both functions coexist.
It is a function very much controlled by the royal power, which must ratify his appointment or name him directly.
It is limited in time, but we never know the expected duration.
They seem to consist of "Ancients" (, "≈°ib≈´tu (m)"), probably the heads of the most famous families of the city.
At the lower level exist authorities with more limited powers.
In neo-Babylonian times, the temples are run by an assembly ("kini≈°tu").
These assemblies have judicial and administrative powers, limited to the internal affairs of the community.
It is therefore an instance of social control at the level of the neighborhood community.
It sits in urban palaces, and is therefore directly present in capital cities.
These revolts can be motivated by a desire for independence, and they usually come after a conquest.
One finds in a very negative light in the mythological account of the Epic of Erra.
Famine often strikes the besieged city, or one that is cut off from its supply routes by the prevailing insecurity.
There is no standard model of the Mesopotamian city, although one can distinguish constants over the long term.
In the archives of Mari, the upper town is called "kirhum", and the lower town "ada≈°≈°um".
The texts distinguish various types of streets (Akkadian "s≈´qu") according to their size, from "alleys", to the biggest ways.
They are generally irregular, because of the evolution of urban planning over time.
The most important axes are the processional ways, present in big cities.
Where I found a hierarchy, which ranges from great axes, adding more small arteries, ruelles et impasses.
The streets are earthen, except for exception (the processional ways of Babylon and Nineveh are paved).
There are sometimes names for the main streets of large cities, as in Babylon, often of religious inspiration.
These streets delimit neighborhoods of housing, distinguishing islands (the channels could also play this role).
The largest are miniature palaces, sometimes up to 1,000 m¬≤.
The average size is between 100 and 200 m¬≤, but there could be smaller houses.
The most affluent dwellings were organized around a central space, which could be a courtyard.
It has long been considered open-air, but there is a growing tendency to qualify this assumption.
All the houses, however, had no central space, far from it.
Each house had a kitchen room, and shops (for domestic and sometimes professional use).
The houses often had to have a floor, identifiable in the excavations by the beginning of the stairs.
The floor served rather the private sphere; there was the room (s) to sleep.
This implied that the residence remained in the family, and it was generally transmitted to the elder, in charge of the worship of the dead.
Nevertheless most of the dead of the cities were to be buried in necropolises.
The houses were the subject of transactions, or transmissions during inheritances.
The construction of new homes was complex in the old cities, where space was scarce.
The Latvian basketball team is the selection of the best Latvian basketball players.
Being a passionate football or basketball player in the weakest teams makes it more ridiculous than famous.
It is placed under the umbrella of the Latvian Basketball Federation.
The Latvian team existed at the whim of their country's independence.
She was therefore one of the major teams of the first European championships, winning the 1935 European Championship before disappearing at the end of 1939.
It is up to him to organize the 1937 European Championship where she gets the sixth place, the gold being won by the Lithuanians.
With the independence of Latvia in 1990, the team reformed to try to regain its glory of yesteryear.
Speed ‚Äã‚Äãmeasurement (V) is essential for dead reckoning.
Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis obtained by dividing the distance traveled by the time spent doing the measurement.
The speed measured by a log is the speed on the water or surface velocity (Vs).
This is to take into account the training of the float by the ship that the gap between the nodes was less than 15 meters.
Then appeared the 'helical lochs' (also called "fish lochs"):
They have a propeller with 4 or 5 blades (fins).
After completing several revolutions, the propeller will have traveled a determined path.
If the number of revolutions can be counted, then the distance traveled can be calculated.
Conversely, if the ship is moving quickly, the propeller will follow while turning quickly.
A distinction must be made between "mechanical" propeller lochs and "electric" propeller lochs.
Pitot tube lochs use the dynamic pressure created by moving water relative to the hull.
These movements use grassroots pressure to convince politicians that international agreements are supported nationally.
The GSsA campaigns in particular for the abolition of the Swiss Army and is at the origin of several popular initiatives.
During the vote, on 6 June 1993, the initiative will be rejected by 57% against 43%.
In 1999, the GSsA introduced initiatives "for a Switzerland without an army" and.
Voted in 2001, the two texts will be rejected (78.1% against the first, 76.8% for the second).
The army is expensive, a budget of several billion Swiss francs a year.
For the GSsA, these funds could be used in other areas.
According to the GSsA, there would be no real military threat.
The threats have changed and the army would no longer be needed.
The Swiss Army would be a source of pollution, nuisance for nature and the population.
The army could be replaced by the civilian service, which, according to the GSsA, would be sufficient to ensure security in Switzerland.
How to ensure democratic civilian control of the army and the police?
In addition to the periodicals "GSoA-Zitig" (in German) and "A Switzerland without an army", the GSsA has published some documents, including:
Eric Saul, born May 26, 1954, is a French motorcycle speed rider.
Eric Saul starts the motorcycle competition at the end of the 1973 season.
This Yamaha TZ is Jean-Paul Boinet's ex-bike, it has hardly been used and is in very good condition.
The passage in the Dunlop curve made it jog to the point of having to cut.
Moreover in terms of power she could not cope with the 4 cylinders Japanese.
How can we cope with this new economic and political power?
He will fall and break his leg which will slow down his participation during the season.
On the advice of Bernard Fau, he will participate in English tests to make himself known.
He runs on a Yamaha TZ of origin prepared by his care.
Eric takes part in the first Grand Prix of the season which takes place in Venezuela.
He is regularly at the forefront and in the top 10 at the finish.
Even if the results are not there, there is a lot of hope.
On April 6, 1980, his friend and pilot Olivier Chevallier killed himself during the tests on the Paul Ricard circuit.
Again Philippe Debarle intervenes and tells him that Alain Chevallier wants to continue despite the death of his brother.
Alain asks him to come to his house at La Prazerie and they leave for the Spanish Grand Prix.
In 1982 he always runs on Alain's motorcycles, and this year the Chevalliers are in the colors of sponsor Johnson.
Ally with a talented driver like Eric, they could pull together the full potential of the machine.
We are on May 2, 1982 on the Salzburgring in Austria.
He is on the podium surrounded by Anton Mang and Patrick Fernandez.
On a wet track he still manages to do the pole but can not qualify.
In 1984 the Paton is back in GP with a 4-cylinder in line 2-stroke driven by Eric.
Today he organizes competitions of vintage motorcycles with his association the ICGP (International Classic Grand Prix).
In his youth, he joined the Al-Fatat party, a political movement opposed to the Ottoman Empire.
He was arrested for his activities in the party in 1916.
Released from prison after the end of the First World War, he enters the government of King Faisal I.
When the French Mandate was proclaimed in Syria in July 1920, Kouatli was sentenced to death.
He returned to Syria in 1924 and took part in the Syrian revolt of 1925-1927.
Exiled again in 1927, he returned to Syria in a general amnesty in 1931.
Kouatli is then a partner and a prot√©g√© of Syrian President Hashem al-Atassi.
Atassi resigns as president of the republic in 1939, as opposed to the French authorities.
His first concern is to sign a treaty with France for French and British soldiers to leave Syria.
After an amendment of the Syrian constitution, Kouatli is re-elected a second time in 1948.
But as president, he no longer has much power, he mainly influences Syrian domestic politics.
As far as domestic politics is concerned, the president's main challenge will be the economy.
In 1959, following a disagreement with Nasser, he was again forced into exile.
Now based in the United States, she has also appeared in television series and in movies.
In fact, the United States played a leading role in the rise of China.
Some Croatian historians consider Croatian Zachlumians from this time on the basis of cultural observations.
But for the academic world, the main source remains De Administrando Imperio.
Oil, the main source of energy in the world, is revealing in this respect.
Zahumlje entered into confederation with the Serb princes of Rascie very early.
The Serbian prince "ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá" of the House of "Vlastimiroviƒá" completely incorporated this area in his area between 927 and 940.
Samuel Boutal is a former French footballer born November 22, 1969 in Bordeaux.
Young, he attended the Girondins de Bordeaux training center with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry.
In the Parisian club, he demonstrates the qualities of his headplay and a fighting spirit at all times.
His association with Steve Marlet is marvelous and he finished top scorer in 1995 with 14 goals.
With a team of high quality (Rothen, Borrelli, Born, Sleep, Guerreiro ...), the club fails after flirting with relegation.
Boutal is more used as offensive midfielder and scores only 3 goals.
The following season he scores 7 goals and plays 25 games.
Boutal played more offensive midfielder this year and scored less (2 goals).
In March 2002, he gave an interview to a journalist from Canal France International declaring his Cameroonian origins (from his father).
And this, just a few months away from the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.
This month, the World Cup invites the world to Brazil.
He plays 35 games, scores 6 goals and finishes National.
But he plays little, (20 games in 2 seasons) and finds himself without a club from the summer of 2007.
Number Three (or Number 3) is a fictional character from the television series "Battlestar Galactica", starring Lucy Lawless.
The humanoid model Cylon Number three has the appearance of a blonde woman, thirty.
Beers seem to be more of a tabloid journalist who likes rumors than a conventional fleet reporter like James McManus.
The social and political repercussions of the "Gideon" incident are becoming too important for President Laura Roslin to ignore.
Better social policies and more investment in education have been important factors.
Biers always seems to be in the right place at the wrong time when creating his documentary.
I am imprisoned here for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Biers also records the sabotage of a Raptor who was supposed to lead Colonel Tigh on the "Cloud 9".
While Biers goes into the infirmary for her documentary, she discovers something unusual.
However, the commander Adama intercepts Biers and asks that she gives him his shots of Valerii.
She returns an empty tape to Adama, managing to conceal the one containing Valerii's real catch.
Beers then have the opportunity to document what is happening at the command post during a Cylon fighter raid.
Biers, knowing the implication of Palladino in the incident "Gideon", suspects that he is the author of death threats.
The final version of the documentary is reviewed by Tigh, Adama and the President.
The documentary is broadcasted for the entire fleet, with Biers ending with this monologue:
But the fleet is not the only group to watch the documentary.
The copy of Valerii is surprised to see his double speaker on the "Galactica".
As in the movie theater, she is assisted by copies of Five, Six and Eight.
Number three is later trapped with Number Six and Boomer under a garage, after capturing Anders.
Thanks to an index of his "internal Gaius Baltar", Number Six discovers the truth.
Shortly after, Number Three resolves to kill Anders despite their prior agreement.
But Number Six proves the suspicions of Number Three by hitting his skull with debris.
The 25 April Bridge (or 25 April Bridge) is the first suspension bridge over the Tagus in Lisbon, Portugal.
In 1960, still under the dictatorship of Salazar, the decision was made to bridge the Tagus.
This task is entrusted to the Americans of the American Bridge with the help of eleven local companies.
The bridge is named Salazar Bridge, according to the dictator of Portugal at the time.
But immediately after the carnation revolution, it is renamed the bridge of April 25, the day of the revolution.
Overlooking the bridge of April 25, the Cristo Rei located in the municipality of Almada faces the city of Lisbon.
Plans for the April 25 deck are inspired by the Bay Bridge, between San Francisco and Oakland, California.
It is a suspension bridge anchored to the ground with two-tier deck truss.
The April 25 bridge also resembles San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and the Edinburgh Forth Bridge.
At its inauguration, the bridge was the longest suspension bridge and the one with the longest main span of continental Europe.
In 1940, the third longest suspension bridge in the world was inaugurated in Washington State.
He also had the longest continuous trellis and the deepest foundations in the world.
The anatomical elements taken are used to prepare a traditional Chinese soup.
The Chinese give him many therapeutic virtues, not scientifically proven, while it is dangerous for health.
The majority of fins are exported to the Asian market, where they are sold at retail.
Some researchers estimate that from 1996 to 2000, 26 to 73 million sharks were fished annually.
It is one of the most expensive fishing products in the world.
Many institutions and companies decide to ban the transport or sale of fins.
Some associations and French media translate this expression by the sparse neologism "aileronage".
The communist governments of the post-war period tried to discourage the consumption of the soup, considered as a product too luxurious.
On the contrary, the Chinese do not consume during the months of July and August considered as unfavorable.
The particular sticky consistency of the soup is due to the physico-chemical properties of the ceratotriches.
Elastoidine, a sulfur-containing scleroprotein found only in the fins, gives the combs better resistance to cooking.
However, the nutritional and gustatory value of shark fin soup is very limited or even nil.
As for these supposed virtues, they have never been scientifically demonstrated.
Ceratotriches are even dangerous for health in high doses because of pollutants bioaccumulated in the body of sharks.
There are, however, some exceptions such as the Sleeping Shark "Ginglymostoma cirratum" and the shark-fin pectoral fins.
Thus, the fins of some species, like those of the blue shark, are very popular.
More than 85 countries export dried fins, most of which transit through the United States to be sent to the Chinese market.
The top 20 account for 80% of the catch, including the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Indonesia, India and Taiwan.
In each case there is a dramatic decrease in shark populations.
As for China, it does not publish the weight, the species, or the quantity fished.
The Galapagos Islands, which are home to large populations of sharks that are particularly exploited, particularly because of illegal fishing.
Shark populations in Costa Rica's territorial waters have been the victims of intensive poaching since the 1990s.
This lucrative business attracts both industrial and artisanal fisheries.
Small boats mix with large fishing vessels and conduct targeted fishing.
In 2013, a new illegal procedure for the removal of shark fins was identified by the authorities of Costa Rica.
Some countries, such as Australia, Japan, Spain, Mexico and other countries of the Americas, are renowned for their quality fins.
They usually have fishing vessels that are sufficiently equipped to keep the fins cool, clean and unsalted before drying.
While countries bordering the Indian Ocean use traditional methods and do not have a cold room.
Despite this practice, the fins are selling, preventing a real change.
However, Sri Lanka is an exception in combining tradition and conservation.
The thick base of the big fins makes cutting difficult, at the risk of altering the rays of the fin.
Sometimes a little salt is applied to the fins, especially on the cut ends.
They are regularly turned to obtain a uniform drying, while avoiding that the sun burns and browns the product.
During the night, the fins have come inside to protect them from animals and dew.
A good final product has a moisture content of about 10-15%.
The fins are then placed in cardboard boxes, wooden crates or jute sacks.
The fins will be exported in this form, they will be processed later by the traders.
Finally, the total transformation consists in separating individually the ceratotriches from the fin.
They are then packed in cardboard boxes or in viscose.
Ailerons are generally classified according to their size, type, color, cut and condition.
Shark fins are sometimes classified according to their color, dark or pale.
Generally, the larger the fin, the longer and thicker the ceratotriches are.
The most popular fins are in the order of the lower lobe of the caudal fin, the first dorsal fin, and then the pectoral fins.
In the Asian market, shark fins are marketed in the form of fin sets, complete or matched.
The complete set consists of two pectoral fins, the first dorsal fin and the lower lobe of the caudal fin.
While small fins, such as the second dorsal fin, anal fins and pelvic fins, have low commercial value.
They will be sold in assortments or net at low prices.
The quality of the product is of great importance in the commercial value.
The treatment methods used, its moisture content, its cut, but especially the age of the shark.
Over time, some parts of the fin lose their natural elastic property and harden.
But, aging is not easy to detect when the flap is dry, it becomes visible only after rehydration.
This phenomenon appears to be more common among species living in tropical waters where sharks age more rapidly.
But as older people become rarer, this problem is becoming less common.
It must have an accurate cut without meat residues and must be clean, with a whitish yellow color.
In addition, the ceratotriches must be long and thick and well welded to ensure a strong visual impact.
Its texture must be soft, which is often not the case for large fins.
For two millennia, China has been importing fins from all over the world and is the main market for this trade.
In question, the incomplete reports of the countries of their trade and production of these products.
For the same period, the weight of shark fins represents only 7% of the weight of the products marketed.
It imports catches from more than 100 countries, with Spain as the main supplier.
It is also the hub of Asia, the big traders find themselves at big auctions.
But the decline in shark populations is making itself felt, forcing fishermen to fish farther and farther.
They regulate many populations of fish and marine mammals, eliminating old or sick individuals.
In addition, because of the lucrative profits generated, links are sometimes established with organized crime.
In addition, gangs armed with poachers officiate in several countries where this practice is prohibited, especially in Costa Rica.
Mercury is present in their tissues in its most dangerous form, methylmercury.
It can cause infertility in humans, diseases of the central nervous system and kidney problems.
At high doses, it causes neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Charcot's disease in humans.
But they do not prohibit all the landing of fins detached from the body.
In all these countries, with the exception of local exceptions, the sale and consumption of shark fin soup remains permitted.
The Chinese restaurants that serve it do not always display the origin of the fins, thus maintaining the illicit trade.
In 2013, 27 countries and the European Union banned "shark finning", however, many international waters are unregulated.
International fishing authorities are planning to ban shark fishing in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
Analysts estimate that 10% of shark fins are carried by the air.
In 2014, more than 100 countries banned shark finning, while nine countries and territories banned shark fishing.
The Far East is the largest consumer of shark fin soup.
A delay too vague and permissive for the associations, which nevertheless welcome the measure.
Mobilization against Shark Finning also involves Asian personalities, but it remains very marginal.
Ironically, soup was on Yao Ming's wedding menu.
In September 2011, he launched an advertising campaign with the slogan: "When consumption stops, the murder may stop.
In March 2012, he renewed his action, supported by 30 representatives.
Thus, a mobilization is noted in certain institutions and chains of restaurants, shops and hotels.
The University of Hong Kong banned shark fin soup on campus.
But according to the NGO Sea Shepherd Conservation Society the law is easily bypassed.
On October 20, 2011, Taiwan passed a law requiring fishermen to return full carcasses to port.
Oceania, with its many coral reefs, is an ideal place for shark finning.
In 2009, the Republic of Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary.
The Department of Fisheries has set fishing quotas for this practice.
According to the New Zealand authorities, around 20,000 tonnes of sharks are fished for 121 tonnes of fins exported each year.
That year, he was also the largest exporter of shark fins in Africa in terms of volume.
Fin fins exported from African countries are considered of low quality.
In West Africa, poverty pushes artisanal fisheries to liquidate remaining shark populations.
In Senegal, a fishing quota system has been put in place, but it benefits only the richest.
Latin America has a limited role in global fin trade, although few countries provide statistics.
Exporters include Uruguay, Guyana, Suriname, Chile, Ecuador and Peru.
This case brought to light the intense poaching taking place in Brazilian waters.
In 2011, the country wants to create a sanctuary to protect sharks and rays by 2012.
This benefits the tourism activity of the country, which generates each year 56 million euros through diving with sharks.
The United States has been an important shark fin trade hub since the late 1970s.
Its suppliers include Australia and Argentina as well as Hong Kong and The Gambia.
Shark fins detached from the rest of the body can not be imported into the United States.
In 2010, Hawaii became the first state to ban the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins.
no-valid-translation
In 2011, shark fins and soup are banned or progressively banned in a few cities across Canada.
Notably in southern Ontario, Toronto, Oakville, Mississauga and Brantford.
The ban is only significant in Toronto and Mississauga, where many Chinese restaurants serve soup.
So far, Markham and Richmond Hill have chosen to treat the motion as a matter of federal jurisdiction.
Exports are mainly blue shark, dogfish, shortfin mako and thresher shark fins.
In 2011, Germany and the United Kingdom stopped issuing these permits.
Spain and Portugal give most of their shark fishermen.
The ban on shark finning for EU vessels remains lax and easily bypassed.
The rest of the world, the European Union in particular, can take note of it.
Due to lack of space in the freezers of ships, this proposal will make this fishery less profitable and therefore less widespread.
Waivers will no longer be granted to prevent fraud.
In Hong Kong, many organizations are fighting shark finning, among them the most active is the NGO TRAFFIC.
Major environmental NGOs like PEW, Greenpeace and WWF also campaign, but to a lesser extent.
These associations criticize the laxity of states in terms of legislation and resources allocated to the conservation of sharks.
Associations also note the inability of many governments to properly enforce their legislation.
The problem is mainly budgetary, but it is also related to corruption.
Like any luxury product, imitations of shark fins are on the market.
This deception is mostly used during Chinese wedding meals, thus allowing to amortize the budget while respecting the tradition.
Artificial fins remain differentiable for a warned, they are less elastic and less resistant to heat.
We also use mushrooms, vermicelli, anything that mimics the texture of the fin.
Thus, this imitation has a homogeneous transparent appearance unlike the real fins that have rather a fibrous structure.
They are insoluble in water like the real ones, even boiling.
To mitigate the difference, an imitation based on gelatin derived from fish has also appeared on the market.
To do this, they must identify the species to which the fins belong.
But sometimes the appearance is not enough to determine the species accurately.
Thus, DNA tests are also used to identify sharks.
Originally tagged as Spanish mole shark fins, the fins actually belonged to white sharks, a protected species.
To complicate identification, traders do not hesitate to whitewash chlorine fins.
The cinema has seized on the subject in order to show in detail to the general public the ins and outs of this fishing.
The documentary film "Oceans" by Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud, released in 2010, shows a reconstitution of fin fishing.
The objective of the Committee is to ensure that nuclear technologies exported to non-nuclear
We know that some recently nuclear-weapon States are using much less sophisticated systems.
nuclear weapons that have not adhered to the NPT, are not diverted for military purposes.
According to his marriage certificate, his parents are Edouard Candace born in 1846 and Marie Joseph Corvo.
His political training was mainly held in Toulouse and in lodge in Pau and Paris.
One of Candace's brothers, Ren√© Binet, born in the Ni√®vre in 1882 was a diplomat.
"The World" of April 14, 1953 and "The Echo Republican" of Chartres of April 15, 1953 publish his obituary.
He worked as a professor of biology in vocational education.
This position of high official of the French Empire requires, in addition to political competences, to implement qualities of
Gratien Candace began his career at the age of 18 as a teacher in Guadeloupe where he became secretary of inspection.
Having come to study in France, he will practice his many talents and pursue a brilliant career as a politician.
He first settled in Toulouse where he was received at the Normal School of Teachers from six candidates out of 80 competitors.
He was elected deputy of Guadeloupe under the Third Republic, in 1912.
Gratien Candace was elected vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies between 1938 and 1940.
He sat in the Chamber of Deputies from 1912 to 1942.
1928-1936: Gratien Candace is registered with the Left Group Radical (GR)
Under the Occupation, Gratien Candace is a member of the National Council established by Vichy.
The weight of the individual national members of the Governing Council is much greater.
In its colonies, France pursues a policy of economic, social and political assimilation.
And both countries have major political, economic and social divergences.
Nevertheless, the political, social and economic dimensions of Syriza's victory are too important to ignore.
The economic and social policies of the different countries have not been enough to compensate for this lack.
Gratien Candace is today seen as a representative of the French Empire at its peak.
The Academy of Colonial Sciences, now Academy of Sciences Overseas, recognizes Gratien Candace as a founding member.
This congress is coorganized with Blaise Diagne and W. E. B. Du Bois.
Speaking of the leadership of W. E. B. Du Bois in the United States, Edward Franklin Frazier says:
They may have been stunned by the audacity of a "negro" from the same peasant background as they.
Gratien Candace is author of numerous books and speeches, including:
When the Spaniards discover and colonize the region of present-day Los Angeles, the economy is traditional and undeveloped.
The local mountains are still covered with abandoned mines and prospectors are still looking for gold in the San Gabriel.
The war weakens European cinema and allows Hollywood to become "The world Mecca of cinema".
During the Second World War, Los Angeles became a center for the production of airplanes, weapons and ammunition.
But the metropolis is already a big industrial and financial center.
In the field of media and film, Los Angeles is at the top of the world.
From the 1970s, Los Angeles experienced a strong deindustrialization like the rest of the country.
International competition and relocation are the main causes.
The end of the cold war marks the decline of the arms industries.
This is only the fourth time since the end of the cold war that the OSCE has met.
The angeline economy is now based primarily on tertiary activities.
The agglomeration is also close to the Mexican border and is a major NAFTA hub.
It is well integrated with the rest of the United States by road and rail.
Los Angeles International Airport is one of the world's leading airports.
They represent a large consumer market with a high standard of living.
A large part of the Angelines comes from another city, even from another country.
A certain number of illegal immigrants are employed in the secondary sector and constitute a cheap labor force.
In fact, 92 percent of the workforce is employed by the informal sector.
On the other hand, the agglomeration has a network of quality universities: Caltech, UCLA, USC, CSULA, etc.
Universities attract students from around the world and work with local businesses.
Los Angeles is distinguished by the production and transformation of hydrocarbons, heavy industries and the importance of the military-industrial complex.
The name of Hollywood, the neighborhood in which this production takes place, has become synonymous with this industry.
The Port of Los Angeles had a traffic of 65 million tons in 1994.
Distribution of Employees by Business Line for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale Region
On March 7 of the same year, his term is renewed for five years.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have favorably assessed their economic and financial policies.
There is much more consensus around monetary policy than tax policy.
International coordination of economic policies should be considerably strengthened to deal effectively with changes of this magnitude.
And the latest estimates of the International Monetary Fund are similar.
I do not think monetary policy, even an unorthodox monetary policy, can do the job.
The municipality, almost devoid of relief, includes a long sandy section of the lower coast of the Gulf of Bothnia.
It then develops rapidly, the economy being based on fishing.
As well as developed economies, emerging economies experienced a boom between 2000 and 2007.
This is true for both developed economies and developing economies such as China.
It is finally becoming a very important market and a plant tar export center.
Far from the disaster of many municipalities in the region it has gained about 50 inhabitants per year since the year 2000.
Kalajoki is the home town of Dallas Stars hockey star Jussi Jokinen.
Professor in the Department of Geography of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of Tunis, his specialty is geomorphology.
Others point to the restructuring of universities' social science faculties.
Since 1979, he has devoted his research work to arid regions, particularly in southern Tunisia.
He was editor-in-chief of the "Tunisian Journal of Social Sciences".
In operational research (theoretical computing), a differential evolution algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm.
The field of evolutionary algorithms has undergone a great development in recent years.
Originally, differential evolution was designed for continuous optimization problems without constraints.
Its current extensions can handle mixed-variable problems and handle nonlinear constraints.
Currently, a large number of industrial and scientific applications rely on differential evolution.
Differential evolution can be classified among the stochastic metaheuristic optimization methods.
Since then, differential evolution has become an unavoidable method for a large number of real problems or benchmarks.
But chronic diseases have become a big problem that requires a collective response.
The last ten years, one can find a large amount of scientific and industrial problems solved by the differential evolution.
Major oil spills and shipwrecks have encouraged the development of boat inspection services.
The European Parliament criticizes Member States for failing to perform their environmental inspection duties.
The various general inspections are called "inspection bodies" when they are at the same time a body of the civil service.
The members of the inspection services are often civil servants who have started their career in active administration, that is to say in the field.
They are therefore people with some professional experience in the field.
Each inspection is headed by a person in charge, who takes the name of inspector general, department head or dean.
As the Minister's principal interlocutor, the head of department is responsible for coordinating the activities of the inspectors.
They are "interdepartmental", that is to say that they can intervene in each ministry without this being foreseen by a specific mission.
They welcome a large part of senior officials from the National School of Administration.
As the name implies, the main mission of inspection services is to inspect, that is, to supervise the departments of the Ministry.
They are rarely interested in the central administration, but monitor the decentralized services and public institutions more.
In particular, inspectors ensure that regulations, instructions or technical standards are observed.
They provide advice to inspected departments as well as to ministers and central administration.
Under certain conditions, general inspections may include controls on local authorities or private bodies.
They can carry out advisory missions to ministries of other countries or international organizations.
But international relations between countries can impose strong constraints on their governments.
Countries that can not borrow on international markets in their own currency do not have this power.
Individually, inspectors general can sit in different bodies such as commissions, boards of directors of institutions or public companies.
"The inspections shown in italics are only made available to the relevant departments".
For multi-member elections, several representatives are elected in a single electoral district.
The proportional votes are organized a little differently: within a single constituency will be elected several representatives.
Some countries practice "full proportional" by using only one electoral district for their entire territory.
France used full proportional representation for the election of its representatives in the European Parliament until 2003.
The election of French Members of the European Parliament has been carried out since 2004 in the framework of eight constituencies called "large regions".
These disadvantages can be overcome by increasing the number of electoral districts.
The consequences of constituency boundaries are fundamental to the outcome of the election.
Electoral divisions are therefore a crucial issue between the different political parties of a country.
Country after country, extremist political parties are gaining ground.
"Electoral gouging" is an operation that consists of altering the sincerity of the ballot to favor a political party.
The choice of these large constituencies is mainly used for supranational elections.
At the European Union level 22 of the 28 Member States practice it.
He was the fifth son of Sir Maurice Berkeley, and brother of William, Governor of Virginia.
Partisan of the king during the First English Revolution, he was appointed governor of Exeter and general of the armies of Devon.
The undoing of the royalist forces forced him to go into exile in Paris.
At the restoration in 1660, he was a member of the King's Privy Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1670 and 1672.
He is one of the signatories of the "Concession and Agreement", a text proclaiming freedom of worship and religion in America.
Freedom of worship was America's best advertisement.
Sugar cane is the main economic activity of Saint Kitts and Nevis until the 1970s.
The offshore financial sector occupies a very important place in the economy.
The total losses of the financial sector in the advanced economies amount to about $ 600 billion.
The main trading partners of Saint Kitts and Nevis are the United States, Italy, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Canada.
It is also necessary that the financial, human and technical stakes be major to consider this solution.
It is therefore urgent and important that dictates the use of transition management.
Transition management originated under the name of Interim Management in the Netherlands in the 1970s.
The business grew strongly in the Netherlands and France, then in England.
France has experienced a strong development from the 2000s.
Contrary to what one might suppose, the market has developed in the United States only recently.
The French market is being structured and in the process of evolution.
Annual market growth is estimated at 4% for 2014.
The development of the profession takes place in Europe from North to South and in the world: from West to East.
It is however very little developed in the Latin countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal) to date.
His intervention prevents the company or organization from investing in recruiting or depleting internal resources.
SMEs and international groups regularly request the intervention of transition managers.
Local authorities, associations and parastatals are also beginning to use this management method.
Investment funds or the Private Equity sector are also prescribers of this type of management solution.
Both investment funds and hedge funds have responded by issuing codes of conduct.
The scenarios are numerous and varied but it is always a matter of completing a major project:
The transition manager validates the issues with the firm, deepens the specifications and accepts the mission.
It is not uncommon for the manager to have held senior management positions in his career.
This selection stage is crucial for future mission success.
Measuring progress and steering is often the key to success.
The average duration of missions is between 6 and 18 months.
Also, upon his arrival, he must plan and ensure continuity.
The transition manager is in all cases an expert of the mission entrusted to him.
External to the company, the transition manager also has a setback, unlike the permanent manager.
It is a player of change strongly involved but who works closely with the team leaders.
The interim manager simply allows you to hold a position or replace a person to a vacant position.
Here again, the executive or the recruited leader must gradually integrate, make his hole "without making waves".
The council will advocate, put forward ideas, concepts after a period of diagnosis.
He does not execute his own advice, does not implement his plans.
The transition manager is in doing so by occupying a managerial and hierarchical function on the teams.
In the company or organization, the transition manager has no past or future, no internal career project.
The transition manager is quickly available, usually in a few days.
It is immediately operational and the organization does not have to endure the long stages of recruitment.
Interim Management is a term of Anglo-Saxon origin, used in other European countries.
After schooling in Pau, at the College of the Immaculate Conception, he graduated from the Ecole sup√©rieure du Bois de Paris.
He registered with the National Union of PTT agents, affiliated to the CGT.
He is the manager of the newspaper of this union, "Syndicalisme des P.T.T."
It is under his responsibility that the police violently crack down on a demonstration by Algerians on July 14, 1953, where seven demonstrators are killed.
In March 2005, the police violently intervened in a protest celebrating International Women's Day.
Because of his weak legislative activity, he was defeated in the 1962 election by Jacques Marette.
Ireland's football team represents Ireland in international football competitions from 1882 to 1950.
It is organized by IFA, the Irish Football Association based in Belfast.
The team mainly played the British Home Championship games against other British nations (England, Scotland and Wales).
She becomes the fourth national team to participate in a football match.
This result remains the record of goals scored for England and the record of goals conceded for Ireland.
In 1884 Ireland participates in the first British Home Championship and loses all three matches.
These defeats, by adding the initial one against England, constitute the records of goals scored by the other British nations.
Reynolds' performance attracted the attention of West Bromwich Albion, who recruited him in March 1891.
The short story is that it was discovered a little later that Reynolds was actually good English.
The English team included Reynolds who had changed national team and Fred Spiksley.
She leads the match 2 goals to 0 before being overtaken by two goals from Stanfield and W.K.
Samuel Johnston had shown the way in the early days of the 1880s.
Gibson and George Gaukrodger were both just 17 when they started on the national team.
Stanfield, by its longevity, reached the 30 selections making it the most cape of the international before 1900.
Ireland's biggest success on a football field came in 1914 with the victory in the British Home Championship.
In 1914 McAteer will resume his post to take Ireland to victory.
In 1899, the IFA also changed the rules for selecting players.
This change immediately brings positive results with a 1-0 win.
Goodall due to a leading center for Ireland and I play for 40 years.
This is the first time that a team other than the England team or the Scottish team has reached the first place of the event.
However, it must be taken into account that the goal difference was not taken into account to decide the teams.
At the 1914 edition of the British Home Championship, Ireland wins the championship alone.
Gillespie scores twice in the 2-1 away win against Wales.
Ireland secured the title by drawing 1-1 at home against Scotland.
In 1922 the new state created in the south takes the name of Free State of Ireland.
This new federation quickly organizes a championship, the Irish Football Championship and creates a national team, the Ireland football team.
During this period, the reciprocal also exists: a few rare players of North-Irish nationality like Harry Chatton play for the State of Ireland.
As of this date, thirty-nine players in total will play for both teams.
Between 1928 and 1946 IFA, like other British nations, is not affiliated with FIFA.
The two "Irlandes" can therefore coexist without ever meeting since they do not participate in the same competitions.
And for their first game, Ireland plays with eight international beginners and loses.
Ireland never regained its prewar level and will never repeat its 1914 feat.
Over the next twenty years, she finished several times in second place.
During the 1920s, Billy Gillespie scored twelve goals including seven at England's expense.
The following match ended in a defeat against Wales.
Thanks to a huge Scottish goalkeeper's performance, the Irish team manages to snatch a 1-0 win against Scotland.
This match remains that of records for Ireland and for an Irish player.
Due to World War II, the competition was suspended in 1939.
During the Second World War, all international meetings are suspended.
However, during this period, Ireland played a friendly match against the British Armed Forces stationed in Northern Ireland.
The British armed forces are weaker than they have ever been since the 1930s.
The match was very prolific in goals, Ireland losing the match 8-4.
The four Irish goals were scored by future coach Peter Doherty.
If you were Irish, I did not give it to Doherty, I imagine who was able to get it. "
From that date until the 1949-1950 season, the IFA regularly selects between five and seven Irish players.
The 1950 British Home Championship serves as a qualifying group.
Northern Ireland hosts the first ever World Cup qualifier for a British team.
This match played in Belfast against Scotland ended in an 8-2 defeat.
The Irish team ended the competition in last place with only 1 point in Wales.
These four players had all played for the Irish football team in World Cup qualifiers.
That means they played for two different federations at the same FIFA event.
Jackie Carey was the last to sign the pledge in April 1950.
However, this exception had to be valid only "if the FAI did not see any objection".
IFA and FAI both continued to play as the "Ireland team".
This practice was not interrupted until the late 1970s.
During the 1890s, Solitude Ground, the home ground of the Cliftonville FC club, hosted eleven international matches.
All other games are held at Windsor Park in Belfast.
In the first games, the Irish team sported different colors, from green to white and blue.
This color is always worn by the national team of Northern Ireland.
The official reason for this change was to avoid confusion with the Scottish national team also dressed in blue.
The initial logo of the Ireland team was a stylized Celtic cross with a harp at its center.
It was replaced from the 1930s and until the 1950s by a clover, the shamrock.
This change took place at a time when IFA was competing with the FAI to embody the real Ireland team.
At that time the clover was also sported by the team FAI Ireland.
The selection of players was the responsibility of a selection committee, without a manager or coach in the modern sense of the term.
Married to Nat√°sa Paza√Øti since 1998, he is the father of twins, Al√©xandros and Al√≠ki, born in 2003.
He was elected secretary to the President of the Assembly in 1989, in charge of the political strategy of the New Democracy.
The elected president wishes to act, but the House refuses to approve the necessary laws, or vice versa.
He was elected to the Central Committee of his party in 1994.
He is also vice-president of the European People's Party from 1999 to 2002.
In June 2002 he was elected Vice President of the International Democratic Union.
However, his government has not undertaken all the reforms requested by the European Union, on pensions or privatization.
He also had to deal with some politico-financial scandals affecting his government.
Moreover, the majority of Greeks find him better able to govern than his opponent George Papandreou.
Kostas Karamanlis pledges to actively fight against too much corruption in Greece and to continue his reforms.
Thus he argues that he needs these elections to complete his budget and pursue his economic reforms.
Political and financial scandals tainted the image of his government, which at the end of 2008 had only one parliamentary majority vote.
The Polish army is resisting the German invasion but the outcome of the fight is hopeless for three reasons:
Armored vehicles are largely old and few, such as light tanks and armored cars.
The aviation is outclassed in the air despite recent models of bombers but few and misused.
The Poles still managed to shoot down 285 German aircraft.
The Germans do not move a single soldier from the Polish front.
In the same period, the Royal Air Force dropped leaflets on German cities.
A Polish offensive launched west of Warsaw (Battle of the Bzura) was crushed on 17 September.
On October 4, the French High Command ordered the withdrawal of French troops that had invaded the Saar.
The last Polish shots are fired on October 6 during the Battle of Kock.
These regions are mostly populated by Ukrainians and Byelorussians, with large minorities of Poles and Jews.
The General Government is subdivided into four districts: Warsaw, Lublin, Radom and Krakow.
The NKVD played an important role in "Sovietization".
Almost all the captured officers and most of the private soldiers are murdered (see Katy≈Ñ Massacre).
Among the arrested personalities are former prime ministers Leon Koz≈Çowski and Aleksander Prystor.
Toutefois, his deportation will be interrupted by Barbarossa's opulence and he resumed that in 1945.
The new authorities are setting up a police regime based on terror.
Only the Communist Party (of the Soviet Union, not Polish) and the organizations subordinate to it are allowed.
All residents of the annexed area automatically acquire Soviet citizenship.
The Polish prime minister of defense will even be a Soviet general, Konstantin Rokossovsky.
The Polish territories controlled by the Reich are divided by decree into two groups in the course of October 1939.
Only primary schools remain in the field of public education.
In addition, violent persecutions are being taken against the Polish clergy.
The "Tannenberg operation" was imagined as early as 1939, before the invasion of Poland.
This plan, prepared in 1941 and confirmed in 1942, aims to achieve the "new ethnic order" wanted by Hitler.
The persons on the list were to be interned or shot.
The Polish civilian population suffers from the German occupation in different ways.
Hundreds of thousands of Poles are deported to Germany for forced labor in industry or agriculture.
Forced labor and child labor, as well as discrimination in hiring, should be abolished.
The general shortage of food, fuel and medicine is also a cause of excess mortality.
Stutthof camp is exterminated by Poles and other non-Jewish populations.
The first victims of gassing at Auschwitz are a group of 300 Poles and 700 Soviet prisoners of war.
In 1942, the SS chose, against the advice of Frank, the district of Zamo≈õƒá to make it a German settlement colony.
There is no collaborative government in Poland and relatively little active individual collaboration.
In the extermination camps, the auxiliaries of the German guards are rarely Polish, but rather Ukrainian or Lithuanian.
During this period, the Germans recognize Jewish councils ("Judenrat") and impose a Jewish framework.
Some massacres of Jews were perpetrated with the active participation of Catholic Poles.
The extent of this type of massacre is a subject of debate.
The National Remembrance Institute has listed 22 other places where similar pogroms took place.
Pilsudski was personally opposed to anti-Semitism and never encouraged it.
The committee later became the "Council for Jewish Aid" (Rada Pomocy ≈ªydom) better known as ≈ªegota.
On a smaller scale, another example is the village of Markowa, which allowed 17 Jews to survive.
The first were grouped in Alexandria, the second directly in France (Marseille) and Great Britain.
The government in exile, based in Angers until June 1940, then in London, is recognized by all the allied governments.
They are allowed in March and August 1942 to leave the USSR for Iran.
The Germans appeal to the International Red Cross to prove that they are prisoners of war slaughtered by the Soviets.
Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk succeeds Sikorski as head of the government in exile.
The definition of post-war borders is another major difference.
Despite pressure from Churchill, the Poles in London refuse this proposal.
The harshness of the occupation of the Third Reich is denounced by anti-Nazi posters produced by the Armia Krajowa (, 1943).
AK units are trying to help the insurgents but, by and large, the Jews remain isolated.
During the year 1943, the AK prepares its forces for a national insurrection whose codename is "Operation Storm".
The AK, under the leadership of Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, launched the insurrection, but the Soviets did not come to the help of the insurgents.
The insurgents are fighting desperate street fights that are so many barouds of honor.
After sixty-three days of fierce fighting, the city is nothing more than a pile of rubble.
On 2 October, Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski signs the surrender order of the surviving Polish forces in the presence of German General Von dem Bach.
The teaching takes place in the premises officially allocated to these vocational schools and benefits from their equipment of practical work.
The end of the year 1944 saw simultaneously the advance of the Red Army and the collapse of the German administration.
It serves as a provisional government and takes control of the administration as the Germans withdraw.
Soviet forces continue to fight against the Polish movement for independence until 1946.
The final annexation of the eastern provinces invaded in 1939 is also in progress, with the exception of Bia≈Çystok, retroceded to Poland.
However, to mollify Roosevelt and Churchill, he accepts in Yalta the principle of a coalition government.
A socialist is at the head of this government, but it is the communists who hold the key positions.
In April 1945, the Provisional Government signed a pact of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union.
Potential opponents of the Communists are the target of terror campaigns with arrests, torture and executions (see Trial of the Sixteen).
The Polish government must position itself on the question of the definition of eastern borders.
Churchill, irritated by the intransigence of the government in exile, shows little motivation to oppose Stalin on the composition of the government.
Hans Frank was captured by the Americans in May 1945 and tried at the Nuremberg Trials.
During the trial, he returns to Catholicism, the religion of his childhood.
He delivers to the court forty notebooks in which he has written his diary.
The contents of this diary helped to establish evidence of the guilt of the accused.
Earlier, he had said: "It will happen a thousand years and the guilt of Germany will not have been erased yet.
It would obviously be desirable to replace them with references in French, when they exist.
In fact, the Office Ch√©rifien des Phosphates employs more than 80% of fathers of families.
The district occupies most of the commune, it is located in the South zone.
It also represents the unofficial name of the common commonly used by neighboring regions to substitute the official.
(or sebata) The northern district, originally built by the in order to accommodate its employees.
At present, the dwellings are occupied by both employees / retirees and third parties.
Although the roads connecting the municipality to neighboring areas (including the city of Khouribga) have been properly tarred.
The resources mobilized remain insufficient to meet the needs of the inhabitants, and the service to say the least catastrophic.
In Syria, 80% of the population can not meet their basic needs.
Finally, taxis available do not serve most of the neighborhood of the municipality.
To move to other municipalities, the inhabitants are led to fend for themselves.
To summarize, the service is dependent on the goodwill of drivers who do not seem to be governed by any law.

The Westerholt Power Station is a coal-fired power plant built in 1981 in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
Few coal-fired power plants would be able to remain competitive if they were forced to internalize these costs.
Imagine a coal-fired power plant that emits only water and clean air.
The Westerholt power station had a 337 meter high chimney.
The Westerholt power plant has reached the end of its life in 2004.
On November 12, 2006, the chimney of the Westerholt power station is proposed for demolition.
It was demolished on December 3, 2006 by explosives.
It is the largest standing structure destroyed by a controlled explosion.
Enzymes play a central role in the regulation of biological processes.
In addition, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
They generally consist of protein molecules derived from the translation of the genome, with the exception of ribozymes consisting of RNA.
Indeed, the chemical reaction catalysed by an enzyme is carried out at a well-defined region thereof, called active site.
There is a relationship between the rate of an enzyme catalyzed reaction and the concentration or availability of the substrate.
Enzymatic activity also depends on pH, temperature and often the concentration of ions and cofactors.
The regulation of this activity can be provided by compounds called "effectors" (generally of low molecular weight).
Positive effectors (or activators) stabilize the active catalytic configuration of the enzyme.
A chemical reaction is a state of equilibrium between the reagents and the products.
In a conventional reaction the reactants are transformed into products until total disappearance or not of a reagent, it is the state of equilibrium.
In theory, like all catalysts, an enzyme is found intact at the end of the reaction.
These sites consist of amino acid radicals forming the protein chain of the enzyme.
Thus, the enzyme facilitates the reaction of the substrate by decreasing the activation energy, by passing through one or more intermediate states.
Let A be the substrate, P and Q products, the reaction is as follows:
There are enzymes with two substrates and two products called bi / bi
Different models exist according to the enzymes, that is A and B the reagents, P and Q the products, E the enzyme.
A + B + E ‚áÜ (E-A) + B ‚áÜ (E-A-B) ‚áÜ (E-P) ‚áÜ E + P if fixation is ordered
A + B + E ‚áÜ (E-A-B) ‚áÜ (E-P) ‚áÜ E + P if not ordered
these enzymes are most often ligases such as ATP synthase, ADP + Pi ‚áÜ ATP
A+B+E ‚áÜ (E-A)+B ‚áÜ (E-A-B) ‚áÜ (E-P-Q) ‚áÜ (E-Q)+P ‚áÜ P+Q+E
A+B+E ‚áÜ (E-A)+B ‚áÜ (E-P)+B ‚áÜ E'+P+B ‚áÜ (E'-B)+P ‚áÜ (E-Q)+P ‚áÜ P+Q+E
A+B+E ‚áÜ (E-A)+B ‚áÜ (E-P)+B ‚áÜ (E-B)+P ‚áÜ (E-Q)+P ‚áÜ P+Q+E
The start of P from the active site is triggered by the arrival of B.
Example: There is competition between methacholine and acetylcholine because they both have a choline group that activates the enzyme.
If the enzyme is saturated with one substrate the other (of lower affinity = higher Kd) will not be catalyzed hence the term competitive.
Non-Competitive Inhibition: Occurs when an agent unrelated to the substrate is capable of binding the enzyme at its allosteric site.
This is the case of enzymes with subunits or protomers (always in even numbers).
Their operation is not Michaelian and the affinity for the substrate increases nonlinearly with the substrate concentration.
This particular kinetics comes from spatial transconformations, there is an allosteric transition between two extreme forms:
Attention, there are enzymes with subunits not being allosteric: alkaline phosphatase, Œ≤-galactosidase.
The affinity increases the most to 1/2 of Vmax where we can note a particular value analogous to km K50.
He performs as a concert artist in Hamburg, his hometown, then Leipzig, Kassel, Frankfurt, London and Paris.
The attacks of 7 July 2005 in my hometown of London have highlighted this.
Many more recent educational works for the cello contain excerpts from these collections.
The Opus 70 studies were recorded by cello duo Martin Rummel and S√©bastien Hartung in 2005.
Martin Rummel has also made a critical edition at B√§renreiter.
He is based in the nation's capital, La Paz.
Members also serve a five-year term, and must be at least 25 years of age on election day.
The congressional elections were held on June 30, 2002.
The parliamentary and senatorial elections were held on December 18, 2005, at the same time as the presidential election.
On December 13, however, presidential elections could well sweat the Concertaci√≥n candidate.
The library and the archives of the Assembly are also located on the premises.
They are Category B agents in the public service.
This rank corresponds to the rank of constable, among the corps of non-commissioned officers of the National Gendarmerie.
After their tenure they can make a career within the National Police.
In Belgium and Switzerland, the guardian of the peace is a municipal officer in charge of public security missions.
In 1829, they are 85, in 1846, they are 292 and their number will continue to grow.
The peacekeeper upholds public order and guarantees the protection of persons and property.
As an agent of authority, he provides assistance and assistance to people, prevents delinquent acts and calls on the perpetrators of criminal offenses.
His work is carried out in investigative, intelligence, intervention or law enforcement services.
In the latter case, he will justify his quality by his professional card.
He assumes different tasks depending on the police services where he is assigned, for example:
He has no judicial qualification until he leaves school and enters an active judicial police service.
The custodian of the peace, holder or trainee, is a judicial police officer in article 20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
He records by PV the statements of any person giving him a clue, evidence or information useful to an investigation.
He carries out arrests, spinning, surveillance, protection and restores public order if necessary.
The custodian of the peace is the first rank of the body of supervision and application.
He can then specialize and go to the service of his choice (anti-crime, judicial police).
A police chief may be named "local police officer" (RULP), and can then replace a police officer.
He has also replaced career officers in the army and police with his own men.
He may also attempt the internal competitions of police officer or police commissioner.
Category B competition in the public service, peacekeepers are recruited through two separate competitions:
In addition, today there appears to be a desire to privatize certain police functions.
Finally, in recent years the number of officers and police commissioners has been reduced.
These three contemporary movements, without logical connections at first glance, finally affect the profession of guardian of peace.
To clarify this point, a peacekeeper out of school is a judicial police officer.
Its level then corresponds to that of police investigator (before the reform of 1995 removing this rank).
The 1995 reform thus simplified the organization of the institution, but also led to some confusion in collective thinking.
Indeed, the officer's corps complains of the constant decline in their numbers to exercise their former duties as investigators.
The transition to practice is however not possible at this time, because of the minimum speed to reach.
In 1910, the Romanian engineer Henri CoandƒÉ presented a plane equipped with a jet engine.
The first flight is very brief and ends with the crash of the aircraft.
On January 16, 1930, the Englishman Frank Whittle filed the first reactor patent.
On April 12, 1937, the first test on the bench of Whittle Unit by Frank Whittle took place.
For his part, Hans von Ohain made several prototypes in 1937 and 1938.
The takeoff and landing are done with the conventional piston engine, the reactor being ignited only once in flight.
It will be followed exactly one year later by the first Italian prototype, the Campini-Caproni CC-2.
The very first jet aircraft is the Heinkel HE178, which will also be the first combat jet aircraft.
In addition, the United Kingdom agrees to supply the engines that it has developed, including the Rolls-Royce Nene.
Thanks to this, the United States and Russia can catch up.
The United States can not continue the failed policies of the past 50 years.
The United States can benefit from the experience of other nations and share their experience with them.
For its part, the United States develop and mass-build the F-84 Thunderjet (first flight in February 1946).
quickly followed by planes able to fly to more than Mach 2:
Civil jet airplanes for passenger transport appeared in the 1950s.
This first flight of the Comet takes place 13 days before that of the Canadian Avro Jetliner project, which will eventually be abandoned.
Unlike the military, this type of aircraft will remain marginal for passenger transport.
Carbon finance is born of a junction between the fields of environment and energy.
These two sectors are set to grow in the coming years.
The boom period of carbon finance coincides with the globalization of trade and the development of e-commerce.
Carbon finance is the fruit of the new economy that is the knowledge economy.
There are several carbon exchanges, (Bluenext, IntercontinentalExchange, as well as the European Climate Exchange.
The Montreal Exchange is also preparing to launch its climate market in 2008.
The carbon market is one of the fastest growing sectors.
This strong growth will benefit emerging markets that export goods and services to the United States.
According to the IPCC, carbon emissions, mainly from fossil fuels, need to be stabilized by 2015 and then reduced.
Otherwise, the consequences could be disastrous, according to IPCC Chair Rajendra Kumar Pachauri.
However, the situation of Thysdrus, with its three amphitheatres studied scientifically, "seems unique in the world" according to Hedi Slim.
It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.
The building was indeed carved out of a tufa hill without any masonry and with irregular shapes.
The stands, in small numbers, were cut in the rock and the cavea was dug there.
There appear to have been 24 compartments of which 16 subsist in various states of conservation.
Golvin also evokes a lodge and a chapel located on the west axis.
The aesthetic is absent from the construction but the technical improvements are important, making it more functional.
Its construction would be linked to a manifestation of √©vrgetisme of the elite of the city.
For Hedi Slim, its cost contrasts with the few epigraphic traces of a local √©verg√©tisme, especially in terms of organization of games.
The monument, which is among the best preserved of its kind, has been little studied.
The recent exploration of the monument has not delivered an inscription to date its construction.
Hedi Slim, for his part, is in favor of completing the project.
Defeated and hunted, she takes refuge with her supporters in the amphitheater and resists for four years.
The disappearance of the bleachers and elements of the last floor would have been posterior and progressive.
The ruin of the monument has resulted in a considerable deposit of cuttings, with a height ranging from 1.50 to three or even four meters.
After further deterioration, people draw heavily on the ruins.
The site is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.
The consolidation prevented the new rock falls and removed the irremediably damaged parts.
One of the means for this increased accessibility has been the restoration of vaults and stairs.
Pillar reconstruction work also helped reconstruct the elliptical shape of the building.
Many fragments of the bleachers have been unearthed in the arena.
It is built on flat land north of the site of the ancient city.
The material, white at the time of its extraction, became ocher with time.
However, the stone used, weak, is sensitive to erosion and wear.
According to Golvin, this fragility of the stone is an explanation of the thickness of the walls and therefore the massive side of the building.
In spite of unfinished decorations, traces of ancient restoration demonstrate that the monument was used.
The shortening of the podium and an accentuation of the slope of the bleachers made it possible to reduce the blind spots.
This dominant is accentuated more because of the use of the large apparatus in the construction.
They were about forty centimeters high and sixty centimeters wide.
Under these runs a ring-shaped service corridor that communicates with the arena through six gates.
Last month the focus shifted to another form of transparency.
One of the pieces has been identified as devoted to the imperial cult.
Interior fittings, including access and evacuation, appear to be more elaborate here than in other monuments of the same type.
The ends of the small axis, seven meters wide, lead to the stairs to access the ground floor.
These hoists were also used for the staging of the shows, the appearance of animals arousing the surprise of the spectators.
There was also a well providing water for the monument, particularly underground parts.
In addition to the amphitheatres, the city had a theater and a circus, which have not yet been searched.
For Hedi Slim, the three amphitheatres in the country show a "permanent craze for games".
Such competition may have generated tension in the ancient city.
The bulls sleep "); in the foreground bulls are lying.
The discussion is noisy and leads to the awakening of some of the bulls who all wear symbols on their rump.
A certain number of other sodalities exercised their activity in Roman Africa, with various emblems and tutelary deities.
This group of conspirators formed a Committee of Public Safety, also known as the evocative "Annexation Club".
They were then determined to overthrow the monarchy, lay down the queen, and annex the archipelago to the United States.
This committee was led by a lawyer Sanford B. Dole and a businessman Lorrin Thurston.
They acted without the approval of the United States government, which no doubt was unaware of the existence of this initiative.
In addition, the United States is protesting the foreign exchange policies of other countries.
The coup took place the next day, and Queen Liliuokalani was forced to abdicate.
The act of abdication stated that she resigned her powers to the benefit of the United States federal government and not the Provisional Government.
It put Washington in front of its responsibilities, hoping to find quickly its throne.
In 1973, she became a professor of political science at Georgetown University.

At Columbia University, she links up with Franz Leopold Neumann, a Marxist revisionist.
In 1970, a member of the Democratic Party, she campaigned for former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, left-wing of the party.
Former Vice President Dick Cheney served in this role after being the CEO of Halliburton.
In 1980, she became a foreign policy advisor to Ronald Reagan during his presidential campaign.
In 1981, she became the only Democratic member of her government.

Infante was a notary, historian, anthropologist, musicologist, writer and journalist, and a great reader and lecturer.
A tireless traveler, lecturer and writer, he was also a political journalist.
The Parliament of Andalusia unanimously approved, in 1983, the Preamble for the Statute of Autonomy of Andalusia.
Where Blas Infante is recognized as "Father of the Andalusian Homeland".
He studied the baccalaureate in Escolapios de Archidona until 1899.
The observation of the condition of the Andalusian laborers leaves him strongly impressed and he writes:
"I have engraved in my consciousness since childhood the dark vision of the laborer.
I saw him walking his hunger for the village wheels.
I think that, for the birth, Nature signals to the soldiers of the Life the place where they must fight for her.
I want to work for the Cause of the Spirit in Andalusia because in her I was born.
If I were in another place, I would fight for this Cause as well.
In 1918, in Ronda, the first regionalist assembly was set up, inspired by the
Federal Constitution of Antequera of 1883, which establishes the way to follow for the Andalusian, to obtain a full autonomy for Andalusia.
These are currently the Andalusian institutional symbols, according to the Statute of Andalusia in its article 6.2:
"We feel the final hour arrived in which it will be necessary to definitively complete the completion of the old Spain (...).
Not good already protect his miserable interests with the blazon of solidarity or unity, which they call national.
By soliciting that Spain sends its army against Germany and for France.
During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Blas Infante rejects all collaboration.
In 1921, he published "the educational dictatorship", a complex philosophical analysis.
In 1928 he traveled to Galicia to meet with the ideologues of "galleguismo".
He takes part in the Galician regionalist magazine called "Nous".
He writes the book "The Truth about Tablada's Plot and the Free State of Andalusia".
And this one should come by means of a great agricultural reform in a new republican and federal Spain.
He defends on many occasions anarchism, for which he had sympathies and which was harshly repressed.
However current studies highlight that the Assembly of Cordova was a disaster for Andalusianism.
The representation was uneven: Cordova and Seville brought 70% of the assemblists, Malaga did not arrive at 2%.
When the assemblies of Seville and Cordova presented their preliminary project, the "Orientals" abandoned the assembly.
The preliminary draft was approved without the participation of the assemblies of Jaen, Almeria and Granada and the abstention of those of Malaga.
Shortly after General Franco's coup, several members of the Falange arrested him in his house in Coria del R√≠o.
Mark Curtis is a writer, British historian and journalist; specialized in investigative documentaries.
Until recently he was the director of the World Development Movement.

It is a strong criticism of the functioning of international organizations, especially the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The WTO judges all countries on the same level, while they are not equal.
The WTO should help to make countries more equal.
He also offers a detailed critique of the foreign policy of Tony Blair's government.
Obama's foreign policy is often criticized for its reactive or improvised side.
Curtis also lists the war crimes committed by the United Kingdom in the Yemen and Oman wars.
He entered "l'Express" in 1954 and became director after Claude Imbert's departure in 1971.
He also worked at "Crapouillot", founded "Pariscope", Parisian cultural guide.
He was deputy editor of the "Figaro" editorial staff during the 1980s.
He has been a member of the High Audiovisual Council and a director of the National Institute for Educational Research.
Soon after, the national council of the audio-visual one condemned the emission.
He produced films including Claude Chabrol's "Les Fant√¥mes du chapeau".
The standard made it possible to homogenize the different specifications associated with the radio resource in the defined radio spectrum bands.
A TETRA-type network offers a shared radio channel that is always open and reserved for a group of users.
Each user can push a button on his device to speak, and all other users will hear his voice.
This makes it possible to establish an immediate communication between a user in the field and a dispatcher, or a group of users.
TETRA portable radio devices can function as mobile phones, with a direct connection to the telephone network (PSTN).
Normal use for a caller group is to press the PTT (Push to Talk) button once.
The user will be connected to the dispatcher and to all other users in this group.
TETRA uses TDMA with four user channels multiplexed on a radio bearer; the carriers are spaced 25 kHz apart.
Digital data transmission is also included in the standard, but at a low rate.
This allows direct communication in situations where the radio coverage of the network has been lost.
This feature is called the DMO Gateway (from DMO to TMO) or the DMO Repeater (DMO to DMO).
In addition to voice and service management services, the TETRA system can carry several types of data communication.
Status messages and short data services (SDS) are provided on the main system control channel.
Packet data or circuit-switched data communication uses channels dedicated to these traffic.
TETRA provides encryption of the program as well as end-to-end encryption.
The main advantages of TETRA over other technologies (such as GSM) are:
This allows users to have a one-to-one radio link between mobiles without having to go through an operator or dispatcher.
and C2000 are currently the only TETRA networks covering an entire country.
The frequency of the symbols is 18000 symbols per second, and each symbol is coded on 2 bits.
Thanks to a phase-locked form, the power of the down-link is constant.
Although the system uses 18 frames per second only 17 are used for traffic channels.
The diagram shows two cells that overlap each other.
The initial choice of the cell is made by procedures located in the MLE and in the MAC layer.
The mobile is allowed to initially select any suitable cell that has a positive value of C1, i.e.
Access to the network will be conditioned by the successful choice of a cell
The mobile device initiates the reselection (handover) of cells in the following cases:
A toolkit for the use of TETRA in public transport applications has been defined.
PlaNYC encourages the use of public transport by providing disincentives for motorists.
The main menu presented to the user offers at least three possibilities:

He played a fundamental role in the economic war waged by France against Germany during the Great War.
Master Masamichi Noro was one of the internal students, uchi deshi ÂÜÖ ÂºüÂ≠ê, of Master Morihei Ueshiba Ê§ç Ëäù Áõõ Âπ≥, founder of Aikido Âêà Ê∞ó ÈÅì.
The Kinomichi¬Æ is a Japanese budo, literally the way (do) that stops the spear (drunk).
It is a discipline that aims at establishing peace and seeking conditions of peace.
Independent and interdependent, he questions the Way, the Do, the Tao.
He posits man as a link between the Earth and Heaven.
In Far Eastern understanding, "ki" is a breath present everywhere and at all times.
According to the Eastern tradition, if parents create man, the master makes the human being into man.
He does the same for his vis-√†-vis in the face to face movement.
From this mutual help come the confidence and the smile of understanding.

This helix distributes the effort from the ankles to the wrists and cervical.
It dissolves the tensions and prevents the articular constraints including those so frequent of the dorso-lumbar hinge.
[...] In both spirit and matter, breath ensures the organic coherence of the order of living at all levels.
It circulates and we are the supports, the channels, the drivers.
It is implemented by children, adolescents, adults to old age.
Its richness is explored by women and men, to each (e) according to his sensitivity.
Differences, often a source of conflict, are at the heart of listening, seeing and touching.
Oriental arts are understandable if one puts one's footsteps in those of the masters.
The shin as heart is both organ and space of perception.
Body, the shin invites us to feel the other, to test his ki, to contact the partner by his energy.
He continues Morihei Ueshiba's quest to make his art a bridge between men.
Master Masamichi Noro makes a point of transmitting the heart of his master's heart of technology.
The technique consists of driving the ki: borrow, drive and return the ki.
However, if the direction is vertical, the given direction is ascending.
To this end, Master Masamichi Noro resorts to the heart, shin ÂøÉ.
According to his perspective, the shin not only allows to feel the other but even more to overcome the antagonism oneself / others.
The shin is the condition of an empathy, of a movement towards the other.
In this sense, we can understand the speech of Morihei Ueshiba: "My Aikido is love" Âêà Ê∞£ „ÅØ ÊÑõ „Å™ „Çä.
If the ki supports the gesture, the shin modulates the palpitation.
It puts in harmony two cadences, which allows the two partners to tend towards the Aiki, the harmony of the breaths.
When asked by Arnaud Desjardins about his art, Master
Masamichi Noro replied, "If I could explain my art, I would not have

The technical richness of this art and the profusion of the variations can make believe in a complexity.
What's more, managers can easily make believe in high performance without being unmasked.
However, a thorough study supported by the presence of a master allows us to glimpse a simplicity that unfolds the understanding of the principles.
Repeating the didactic approach of his master Morihei Ueshiba, Master Masamichi Noro has selected 10 techniques as bases.

The term Kinomichi is a neologism created by Me Noro and also a trademark filed by him since 1983.
Only this term is able to guarantee compliance with the teaching and the method of Me Noro.
The French Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction speaks of "significant point alcoholism" (API).
In France, it has been increasing rapidly among adolescents since 2003.
At the end of August 2008, an "alcohol plan" was set up by the prefecture to take measures.
"This is" standard glasses "whose exact capacity varies significantly depending on the country.
In terms of tripling it: 8% of students reported 15 drinks and 2% of students, 12 drinks.
The typical student declares to drink on this occasion 18 glasses a day (10 for women).
Functional impairment in the short and medium term is also reported and studied.
Also, there are only three solutions in the short and medium term.
Some are short-term issues; most, in the medium term.
Similarly, the supply of free alcohol to minors in institutions becomes prohibited.
The report proposes to work on prevention with students rather than increase penalties.
Upon his return, he was appointed professor of philosophy at the Lyc√©e de Toulouse in September 1848.
A metaphysical prize, awarded by the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, bears his name.
The price of a moral foreign policy simply became too high.
It then gives way to the next period, called the Bronze Age, followed by the modern age.
In the 1950s, these three genres disappeared in their turn.
Then, it is the disappearance of the first distribution company which weakens even more the profession.
As the American society evolves, the formal aspects also change.
This accusation is unfounded, since it has since been shown that this increase was directly proportional to that of demography.
She is however virulent and finds many voices to wear it.
The fact that juvenile delinquents say they read comic books is especially taken as a common denominator.
The psychologist Fredric Wertham takes this idea in his book "Seduction of the Innocent", published in 1954.
The bankruptcy of these publishers causes that of distribution companies, which train themselves other publishers in their fall.
These are years of crisis, which many publishers stop their activities.
Tired of war, Atlas Comics released its latest superhero title, an issue of "Submariner Comics", in October 1955.
Other publishing houses are also trying to launch comics of superheroes, without more success.
The latter take the opportunity to impose adverse conditions on publishers.
In 1955, it is still one of the most important comic book publishing houses in the country, publishing 85 magazines.
The most important at the time, Dell Comics, continues to sell more than one million comic books.
Some historians consider this character as the first superhero of the silver age.
According to him, the Martian Limier did not have the potential to usher in a new era for superhero comics.
The rebirth of this character is the work of publisher Julius Schwartz, screenwriter Gardner Fox and cartoonist Carmine Infantino.
It is Julius Schwartz, big fan of science-fiction, which is at the origin of this evolution of the character.
1956 is therefore an important year for DC, since it sees the recreation of the former glories of the publisher.
She also sees the purchase of a former competitor: the publishing house Quality Comics.
DC becomes the owner of several heroes like Blackhawk, Plastic Man Jack Cole or Uncle Sam.
Batman and Superman are also members, although their appearances are, at first, reduced to cameos.
Tired of writing monster stories, Lee was about to leave the publishing world.
The script is served by the drawing of Jack Kirby who since 1959 is working again for Atlas.
Kirby often participates in the creation of heroes before leaving the hand to another designer.
The following year, Iron Man made his first appearance under the brush of Don Heck.
At the beginning of the silver age, the publisher Dell Comics remains the largest publisher on the market, ahead of DC and Marvel.
In 1955, Dell publishes more than half of the comics that appear in the United States.
The latter prefers in 1962 to create its own comic book publishing house: Gold Key Comics.
Both companies continue to publish adaptations of television series, but also original creations.
They stop buying licenses of existing characters and are content with those they own.
These series, however, are not very successful and all disappeared in 1967.
These series are of little interest and the authors, very poorly paid, do not seek to produce quality works.
They do not stay there long before finding elsewhere contracts worthy of their talent.
This production, generally of low level, persists throughout the silver age.
Dick Giordano leaves the following year Charlton for DC and takes with him many cartoonists.
Charlton then returns to its classic production: follow the fashions and limit production costs as much as possible.
During this period, comic strips lose their importance in the newspapers and the place granted to them decreases.
In addition, humorous strips begin to supplant other genres, such as adventure series.
Harvey Kurtzman, creator and editor of the first issues, left the magazine in April 1956.
His replacement, Al Feldstein, manages to make the magazine a huge success with sales consistently exceeding one million copies.
John Severin, another EC Comics alumnus who worked with Kurtzman, is one of the main contributors to this magazine.
After stopping this magazine, Kurtzman becomes responsible for a new comedy magazine called "Help!"
After the replacement of Gloria Steinem by Chuck Alverson as assistant editor, the number of comic books present increases.
New figures appear like Gilbert Shelton, Robert Crumb or Skip Williamson, future stars of the underground comics.
James Warren decides to publish more comic magazines: "Creepy" begins in 1964 and "Eerie" in 1966.
Warren Publishing's editorial director is Archie Goodwin, who is also a key writer.
Another publisher also publishes horror stories: Eerie Publications.
His magazines, however, are of much lower quality than Warren's.
Most of the stories are reissues from the lost publishers' funds.
Less important than Warren Publishing, however, Eerie Publications managed to maintain itself from 1966 to 1981.
It is especially during the Bronze Age comics that she is active.
The main meeting points for "comix" authors are then Austin, Texas, and California.
This implies printing in limited quantities, which does not prevent these comics from having an important influence.
Comix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe way for many authors to broadcast their comics.
Among these, we find Robert Crumb who published in 1967 "Zap Comix".
The success of these comix leads to the creation of the first specialized publishing houses in this genre.
In the late 1960s, as traditional comics go out of steam, underground comics are enjoying their golden age.
The Comics Code Authority had indeed lifted its ban on vampires and other fantastic creatures earlier in the year.
Craig Shutt refutes the idea that Gwen Stacy's death marks the end of the silver age.
It is therefore not with a crisis, but with a gradual transformation of comics that the silver age ends.
Marvel Comics characters are also eligible for cartoon adaptations.
Sometimes, during a fight, an arm or a leg can also be reworked to give the impression of movement.
Movies and television series are also the subject of comics.
The silver age is also marked by an increase in the price of comics.
The first publishing house to leapfrog the price increase is Dell Comics.
This is why designers are abandoning this aspect of the work to devote themselves above all to drawing, which is more lucrative.
Superhero comics of the Silver Age are dominated by two companies: DC Comics and Marvel Comics.
When he begins creating comics of superheroes, Stan Lee abandons the unwritten rules of the genre and innovates in several areas.
We discover then that the two characters live in parallel worlds to each other.
The characters who appeared during the Silver Age, as well as those who will come later, live on Earth.
From the start, the stories of the new Flash give up the humor that characterized those of the previous version of the character.
The adventures of the new Green Lantern are aimed at a readership of mature teenagers.
Without departing from the general style of superhero stories, the authors introduce various innovations that deepen the psychology of the characters.
Marvel's heroes are sometimes marginal, even rejected by society, like the "X-Men".
This idea is also found at DC in the series "Doom Patrol", created a few months before "X-Men".
DC and Marvel are also distinguished by their use of recitatives.
Stan Lee seeks to create a friendly relationship between readers and writers.
Nevertheless, they may provide additional information, serving as a counterpoint to the speech.
Some boxes are crossed with the usual form of the thought bubble to introduce a flashback.
The identity of the two publishing houses also depends on their artistic style.
Little by little, designers are inventing new ways to portray action.
Dives and downs are becoming more frequent, and designers are adopting a more expressive style, especially at Marvel.
Some style conventions are implicitly established on Silver Age titles.
At DC as at Marvel, the authors work under the authority of a director of publication.
DC is behind Marvel regarding author credit.
At the end of the period, writers and draftsmen enjoy greater recognition.
Stan Lee, by doing so, innovates less than he develops pre-existing ideas.
Finally, some publishers, such as Charlton Comics, organize writing competitions that contribute to the interactivity between the publisher and the reader.
They have their place in an America where the federal state is powerful and the middle class thrives.
During the early years of the silver age, DC comics continue to offer strong, optimistic and forward-looking characters.
It is mainly Marvel who, at the beginning of the period, innovates on this point by portraying characters prone to doubt.
The comics of the silver age also tackle the fight against communism.
Comics are also used by political and religious organizations for the fight against communism.
The context of the cold war is particularly present in Marvel, where espionage regularly plays an important role.
This fourth power role was particularly important at the time of the administration of President George W. Bush.
The communist enemies of Thor or Hulk disappear quickly enough, Iron Man remains an exception for a long time.
The heroes of the comics are always white and, for the most part, men.
Marvel, however, shows a lead on DC, creating Gabe Jones, a black teammate Nick Fury.
The creation of the character is however a sign of the progressive taking into account of the black population.
This is one of the signs of the gradual end of the silver age, followed by the Bronze Age.
The salesmen, seeing a black hero on the cover, had not even wanted to present the title.
This team brings together superheroes who are hated for who they are, namely mutants.
The series express more social concerns and the characters feel concerned by the world around them.
From 1972, Marvel publishes "Luke Cage, Hero for Hire", first series featuring a black superhero.
New heroes, new themes and new authors then impose a new age of comics.
Born into a Jewish family, Rubinstein was destined to become a rabbi.
This decision came after his fifth place in a 1903 tournament in Kiev.
His success comes largely from his training with the very strong player Henryk Jerzy Salwe.
At the end of the year, he won the Warsaw championship.
Before the Second World War, the world champion designated the opponents he wanted to face for the title.
After the Second World War, many European countries enshrined considerable social guarantees in their constitutions.

The Rubinstein variation of the nimzo-Indian defense is a regularly used line: 1.d4 Cf6 2.c4 e6 3.Cc3 Fb4 4.e3.
Finally, Rubinstein was particularly skilled in the finals of the game, especially in the rounds, where he made important contributions.
In 1912-1913, negotiations were held with world champion Emanuel Lasker for the organization of a match.

In 1994, Rouvoet invested heavily in the preparation of the program for the legislative elections.
In 1997, he was named honorary member of "Marnix van St.
Aldegonde Stichting ", whose leadership he had left after his election.
After the 1998 elections, Rouvoet became a member of the parliament's presidium.
In 2001, the RPF united with another Protestant party, the GVP, to form the party named ChristenUnie.
In Parliament, he shows particular interest in the values ‚Äã‚Äãand standards debate initiated by Prime Minister Balkenende.

It is important to know that this curve, although bell, is not superimposed with that of Gauss.
Hubbert concluded that US oil production (48 states) would peak in 1970.
The production curve was modeled by the following formula (called the logistic function):
This formula above is a simplification of a more general formula:
then the annual production formula_11 that is to say that it is defined by a parabola of intersection zero and U.
The shape of the curve and its implications make it also known as "Hubbert's Peak".
In practice, the peak is reached when about half of the resource has been exploited.
In the case of oil, this curve is called the oil spike (see graph opposite), a controversial subject.
Of course, non-renewable resources (fossil fuels, metal ores, for example) provide the most examples.
Of course, the expansion of renewable energies alone is not enough to combat climate change.
A reorganization is an operation in which an organized group has its organizational structure reworked to achieve a new configuration.
Apprehended in generality, the nature of the phenomenon is however debated, the keys of entry being multiple.
If we therefore abstract from more semantic than actual differences, we find two major categories of definition:
In this respect, Vincent Ramus (1999) distinguishes seven main "drivers" of restructuring:
Restructuring is the subject of much debate, but the extent of the phenomenon and its consequences is poorly understood.
Bernard Gazier (2005) notes that "job losses due to industrial restructuring are as old as capitalism".
The forms they use, however, vary according to places and times.
But since then we have been experiencing a new acceleration and restructuring over the last forty years has changed in nature.
Restructuring is part of the permanent movement driven by the capitalist economy.
Indeed, as Lassudrie-Duch√™ne and √únal-Kesenci observe, "the exchange gain analyzed by the theory is not a net gain.
Originally, the theory of comparative advantages applies to exchanges between countries.
They will join the theory of competitive advantages formalized by Michael Porter in the early 1980s.
Schumpeter thus distinguishes three economic cycles in relation to so many clusters of innovations relating to a technology:
Economic crises are another vector of restructuring through the effects of the disappearance and concentration of the companies they generate.
The proposed approaches can be divided into two broad categories:
In any case, in a crisis situation, the restructuring of enterprises and that of the financial sector are closely linked.
As in the financial sector, in the nuclear crisis could be the mother of the reform.
Bowman and Singh (1993) distinguish three broad categories of restructuring, most often related to:
It also shows contrasting results whose synthesis leads to the following main conclusions:
The authors also highlight four limitations to these approaches:
In other words, when the personal and environmental context of individuals generates a strong feeling of insecurity of employment.
This impact on the remaining employees appears, according to the author, as "a blind point of restructuring", still insufficiently studied.
They, in turn, led to very heavy restructuring of administrations and companies in the countries concerned.
The failure of the Seattle Conference in 1999 and the events surrounding it provide an illustration.
However, this convention has only been ratified by a small number of countries, including France.
Three European directives requiring national legislative transpositions have thus been adopted to produce, depending on the country, variable results:
But they are also part of the general framework of employment policies deployed nationally.
The necessary policy framework must be a regional framework and, luckily, it exists.
However, these policies come from various conceptions that lead to favoring one or another lever of action.
They also find their coherence only within a wider institutional system that gives them their effectiveness.
However, the degree of social or managerial acceptability of some of these responses is influenced by the current model.
It is during this period that are set up:
Active employment policies as developed in Denmark are one example of such an approach.
Most corporate restructurings take place in silence or cause only local excitement.
Over the last ten years, in France and Belgium, this has been the case in particular:
Some films halfway between documentary and fiction or pure fiction have also taken hold of this problem.
His father is the physiologist Oskar Minkowski and his uncle is the mathematician and physicist Hermann Minkowski.
He works in Germany until the rise of Nazism makes him lose his teaching position.
He goes to the United States, first with the intention of staying there for one year.

Once the elections are over, however, there is hope that the new government will restart the negotiations.
The Edrians are giants of turquoise color with heavy black beards, with a severe and mystical temperament.
In the first edition of "Chronicles of Erdor", this people was described as follows:
The color of these eyes ranges from blue to green, sometimes with exceptional colors.
Edrians do not wear fingerprints on fingers or toes.
On the other hand, palms extend to the middle of the finger, as well as from the middle of the forearm to the mid-biceps.
The [females] are as robust as the [males], sporting a solid frame and protruding kidneys.
The hair of the latter takes on a silvery tinge as they get older.
(...) Of a massive constitution, the Edriens are giants who exceed a head Sirens and Jamiriens.
Their tolerance, however, takes root in their religious prescriptions and denotes a profound indifference to the rest of Erdor.
Although they venerate the four Old Gods of the South, their tutelary deity is the Sublime Predator ("Hirchtak", in the Edrienne language).
The cold barrens of the South suffer from a stormy climate, where isolated communities struggle to survive tyrants and elements.
Their heart is nevertheless generous: nothing could break their hospitality once granted.
This strange attitude is not without causing some discomfort among strangers, worried about their coldness.
The fundamental values ‚Äã‚Äãof their society are: tradition, piety, hospitality and stoicism.
Old societies have their customs and traditions; more recent societies have laws and courts.
In addition to the Edrians, the South is divided between several peoples who share a certain common culture:
‚Ä¢ The Threx'griks, though ethnically similar to the Edrians, are savage looters who have reneged on their civilization.
Having refused the Ancestral Pact, their bellicose tribes plunder the Southerners.
(Their name, in the English version, is in this title "", alias "Those who betrayed the pact").
‚Ä¢ The Gemishs, blue crosses from crossings between Edrians and Jamiriens.
The majority shares the culture of the Edrians, but lives on the margins of it.
‚Ä¢ The Aythrofs are huge corals, living recluse in the Plain of the Ancients.
They share the religion of the Edrians; their tutelary deity is the one who waits ("Shyruk" in the Edrienne language).
‚Ä¢ The Dryylphs are enigmatic fairy-plants of the Eternal Forest, a cold and eternal recklessness.
They share the religion of the Edrians; their tutelary deity is the Lady of Rotting ("Kelaratt" in the Edrienne language).
‚Ä¢ S'Uuraks are crocodile-octopus living under the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDreams.
They share the religion of the Edrians; their tutelary deity is the Mother of the Depths ("Ishagash" in the Edrienne language).
It is by misuse of meaning that the substantive assistantship has become in certain speeches synonymous with assistance or the condition of being assisted.
The term assistantship refers pejoratively to a system of redistribution of wealth or solidarity, whose perverse effects ruin the function.
More broadly, the term is then often used to designate and criticize all forms of welfare policy drift.
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãassistantship was put forward by several of the candidates for the 2007 French presidential election.
During the French presidential elections, the two candidates tried to separate their private life from their campaign.
His experimentation in certain departments is provided for in the "TEPA law" passed under the Fillon government.
The Asterinidae form a family of sea stars, of the order Valvatida.
The periphery of the body is thin and formed of tiny, indistinct marginal plates.
Several species have access to asexual reproduction by fission, increasing their population potential.
Some species may "hatch" their juveniles (which do not pass through a planktonic larval stage), such as "Asterina panceri".
They are found in almost all the seas of the world, from the abyss to the surface and from the poles to the tropics.
It turns out that almost every system in the world is composed of such levels.
A third quasi-contract has been discovered by jurisprudence, unjust enrichment.
Quasi-contract is a legal fact, more precisely a purely voluntary fact, according to the legal expression.
The person for whom he acts is called the master of
For there to be compensation, the Civil Code supposes the proof of a useful management by the manager.
This condition can also be fulfilled even if the manager and the master of the case do not know each other.
This intervention must be for the benefit of a specific person, that is to say that the manager must not have acted in the public interest.
Case management must be useful and timely and the manager can practice legal and / or material acts.
The manager should not have thought he managed his own business.
This is the assumption that a person is sure of inheriting a building and that it repairs it only because it is sure to inherit it.
More and more, she admits that the act is only partially disinterested.
Conversely, the master of the case must not have opposed the intervention of the manager.
We can not ignore the refusal of the master of the case.
In the event that the business owner does not have the legal capacity, he is held acts by the manager.
Business management can result from either a legal act or a material act.
The way the manager intervenes can be either
In the event that it is a legal act, it is said that this act can be passed:
Some authors oppose the latter possibility because the acts of disposition are too serious.
The case law seems to stop at the idea that business management can result in an act of disposition.
Business management does not depend on the seriousness of the act by which it has materialized.
This condition of utility of the act of management is the heart of the problem.
Jurisprudence hopes that it is this criterion of utility that will discourage inconsiderate interventions.
We find that utility does not necessarily mean that there was an emergency.
The act of repairing a roof will be considered useful, even if two days later a fire destroys the building.
The usefulness of the act will be appreciated without taking into account the results that this act will have given.
We can therefore compensate for acts that have not really been useful.
Without being required by law, he will bear the financial consequences of running the business.
The effects of business management are to create legal, legal obligations.
The obligations weigh as much on the manager as on the master of the case.
The first of these is to manage as a "good father" the business of others.
He must bring others' belongings as if they were his own.
If not, he may be held responsible.
In each case, US institutions and officials held responsibility for other institutions and officials in the country.
The Civil Code will only be understanding if the act of devotion is serious.
Management started and interrupted may have more harmful results than if nothing had been done.
The manager can not limit himself to the management of this or that part of the business.
When a business management is taken, the manager agrees on the whole of it.
This also helps to know what the manager has to give back to the master of the case.
The master of the case must compensate the manager for all necessary expenses that have been made for his benefit.
Expenditures of an excessive nature will not be compensated.
The master of the case must also compensate the manager for damages that may have been suffered during the management.
Thus the master of the case will have to take back this contract to his account, as if he had always been the sole contractor.
Whatever the elements of the contract, he will be required to respect the clauses, and pay the price.
The docks of the same name were formerly part of the Port of London, one of the largest in the world at the time.
It is high time everyone participated equitably in the common good.
This area has now been rehabilitated under the auspices of the London Docklands Development Corporation for commercial and residential use.
The London "Docklands" include an old docks complex (from west to east):
Hugh Hellmut Iltis is Professor Emeritus of Botany at the University of Wisconsin (USA).
He is best known for his discoveries in the field of corn genetics.
As a botanist, Iltis served as director of the herbarium at the University of Wisconsin.
It was thought at one time that the wild ancestor of cultivated corn was an extinct species.
However, controversies remain as to what steps separate modern maize from its distant cousin, teosinte.
Some species are endangered and all have a very small dissemination area.
¬∑ Most species occupy a small geographical area and are locally rare
For its work, Iltis convince le gouvernement mexicain to dedicate resources to the preservation of habitat from tenacious sauvages.
I received a tomato salvo who was still in class because of the taxonomists and whose note No. 832.
He sent samples and seeds to various specialists in the field, and collected specimens for several herbaria.
It has been used to improve the flavor and the content of the cultivated tomatoes by hybridization.
He is a convinced and uncompromising environmentalist, a champion of the safeguarding of endangered or endangered habitats to preserve biodiversity.
The signatures formalizing its creation were made in the Hermitage Castle in Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, property of Emmanuel de Cro√ø-Solre at the time.
It operated its mines for nearly two centuries (1757-1949), until the nationalization of mines.
This research is extremely difficult because the deposit does not flush on the surface.
In addition, the water table was at a relatively small distance from the surface.
As we deepened the wells, we had to evacuate the water.
At Christmas 1720, the casing of one yields, several partners withdraw and equipment is sold.
The work was continued for ten years, digging new pits, but moving east towards Valenciennes.
From 1734 to 1734, most of the 35 wells found are profitable.
During the merger, it becomes one of the first industrial companies in Europe.
"(The families Desprez, Lecouteulx, Claude Perier, Guillaume Sabatier, Bernier, Pourrat, Thieffries).
Therefore, "" Thanks to the financial support of Sabatier, the Periers gradually take control of the Mines of Anzin.
In each commune, the soil was probed; and the companies were created and the concessions grew overnight. "
Anzin is "one of the first major industrial companies in France".
The claim was the cancellation of a pay cut of the amount decided by the company in 1824.
But another cause was the failure to take into account the difficulties of minors.
√âmile Zola chose to visit it to situate the action of his novel "Germinal".
He arrives at the time of the strike of the 12,000 miners of the company.
From the beginning of the strike, the dismissal of 140 trade unionists hardens the conflict.
It lasted 56 days and, echoed by the press, had a national repercussion.
But the mining company did not give in, and on April 17 the miners had to go back to work.
One consequence of this strike was the authorization of the unions by the Waldeck-Rousseau law.
Two wells were dug by the Desaubois Company, but it is a failure, hence the name of the day's swallows.
The mill's avaleresses, dug a little to the north of Escautpont church, were begun in 1716 and abandoned the following year.
The rupture of a piece of casing in 1721 leads to the destruction of the well and its abandonment.
The three wells are located in the same area, rue Jacques Renard in Fresnes-sur-Escaut.
The avaresses of the Sars were undertaken on the territory of Petite-For√™t.
Wolf Skin Exhaustion is the ventilation well, located right next to the first well.
This well is located outside any concession, the date of abandonment is not known.
The avaleresses of the Bosquiau were started in 1728 in Bruay-sur-l'Escaut, and abandoned in 1729.
Quarouble's avaleresses were opened in 1729 in Quarouble and abandoned the same year.

The swallows of the Cross are the first two wells attempted on the territory of Anzin.
The well of the pit Toussaint Carlier is dark in 1730.
The pit pit of the Citadel was opened in 1731, and abandoned in 1733.
They seem to correspond to those cut on the concession of Marly by the pits Petit and Saint-Saulve.
This is the first ever well open on the territory of Valenciennes.
Opened the same year, the pit Saint-Pierre is located in the south-west of the pit Cr√®ve-Coeur.
The Avaleresse du Bois de Hurlies was opened in 1732 on the territory of Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut and abandoned ten years later.
It is necessary to dig a second well, Pav√© Sud, before exploiting to ensure the drainage of water, it was started in 1735.
The first well is closed in 1750 and the second in 1760.
This space gradually gave way to private companies from 1990.
Both wells are indicated by materialized wellheads.
This one is located in Anzin, and the well is indicated by a non-materialized wellhead.
This well is located along the Schelde towpath near the former industrial site Vallourec, in Anzin.
It is less than five meters from the Scheldt Canal.
This street formerly depended on Anzin, until 1834, when the hamlet of Ecorchoir was attached to Valenciennes.
A non-materialized wellhead is installed at the intersection of Dupontel and Gambetta Streets, near a wooden post.
The wells are, according to the inscriptions, located in the gardens of two houses.
The well is dark in 1738 in Anzin, and abandoned in 1764.
A non-materialized wellhead indicates the well, it should be located Cour Daubresse, or Impasse Pouill√©.
The extraction pit is located six meters behind its stele, the depletion well three meters behind.
In 1738, the Durfin pit was opened between the Caulier and Clausin pits, opened the same year, in Fresnes-sur-Escaut.
Non-materialized wellheads are located along Jacques Renard Street.
The pit is located at the place called "La Croix d'Anzin" in Anzin.
The sinking of the pit Saint-Nicolas is undertaken in 1740, two wells are dug, spaced about twenty meters.
The materialized wellheads both have a firedamp outlet, also known as a "vent".
The closing date is not known with certainty but is probably in 1746.
For reasons unknown, it is abandoned six toises or eleven meters deep, and becomes an avaleresse.
It is installed on the top of a concrete fence pillar.
The passage of the calcareous or sandy zone in which the water bodies are concentrated is always scabrous.
Many wells were submerged despite the intervention of many hand pump batteries, the only means available at that time.
This name comes from the fact that this well was placed "in the center of gravity of the panel to d√©houiller".
The well of exhaustion is abandoned in 1848, the well of extraction is in 1860.
The pit is now located south of Marcel Caby School, in the city of Three Trees.
The wellhead materialized well extraction is located on the road, that of the well of exhaustion on the sidewalk.
The well was dug in 1751, by the "Compagnie de Mortagnes" on the "Odomez Concession".
She exploited six beautiful veins of good dimensions: "Nine Palms", "Escaille", "Eight Palms", "Twelve Palms", "A.Filons" and "Five Palms".
After 35 years of exploitation, it was abandoned in favor of the Saint-Roch pit.
From the name of the place where this avaleress was attempted, the Scarlet Pit was a failure.
Opened in 1753, this well was 679 toises from the Saint-Thomas Pit.
He intersected five veins called "Fourteen Palms", "Pascal", "Six Palms", "Elizabeth" and "Saint Peter" that we exploited until the turn of the century.
"Veins", veins in which Saint Thomas still exploited four sizes at the end of the year 1810.
Toutefois, this fossa was later abandoned and higher than in October 1811.
The swallow of 1754 was opened on the territory of Petite-For√™t.
The Small Fire Machine well was started in Valenciennes in 1755.
Equipped with a firedamp outlet, it is located rue Pierre Warin between two residences, and facing corons.
The exhaust well of the Old Machine is then backfilled in part.
Its final closure dates from 1823, when the squeeze was made.
Having become useless the well of the Old Machine was tightened and filled in 1916.
The Br√ªl√©e pit is the first pit opened by the Anzin mining company in Fresnes.
The two wells opened in 1760 are burned the same year.
That of the Pit of the Foot, in very bad condition, was the first closed.
Odomez's avaleresse was opened in 1762 in the territory of Odomez and abandoned the same year.
She exploits the greasy veins of "Voisine", "Maugr√©tout" et "Grande Veine".
We meet for the first time what will be called later the "Torrent of Anzin".
This is the last concrete frame of Mines Anzin still visible in 1992, it still exists.
The exhaustion well, backfilled in 1854, is located along the college fence.
There is every reason to believe that the extraction pit is located within the precincts of this college.
In 1770, after a long trial, an arrangement was finally found between the two rival companies.
In the long run, an open society can only survive if the people living there believe in it.
The well kept its name and the corons attached to it.
We will notice the spelling of the name Desm√©zi√®res became Dem√©zi√®res and Long Pr√©s became Lomprez.
Its name comes from the fact that its opening took place on the day of the feast of this Saint.
The well is located in the perimeter of the Tessier Clinic in the North, near the D√©sandrouin Avenue.
A well will remain until 1804, unless both wells were tightened in 1804.
The My Desire South well is equipped in 1807 with a wheel machine.
Squeezed and filled on the surface July 22, 1861, it is the secondary well.
The well of the Avaleresse d'Oisy was dark in 1776, southwest of Oisy.
A past (vein) of coal of three centimeters has been discovered.
This well is mentioned as an avalitor by the BRGM
This swallow was opened north of Scarlet Pit in 1779.
It was abandoned thirty meters deep after a sudden rise in water.
The well is dark in 1780, the pit is stopped in 1822
The Marais pit was started in 1782 in Valenciennes and abandoned in 1834.
Four wells had been dug without success on the same premises.
The digging is very difficult: it takes three years to cross the water level.
Recognition being considered sufficient, the pit was abandoned, decayed and even filled.
The well was finally backfilled and tightened in August 1897.
The Avaleresse des Quatre Pagnons was opened without success in Fresnes-sur-Escaut.
The first grave of Hergnies, then named avaleresse d'Hergnies, is open from March to December 1791.

The Great Wez Pit begins to extract in January 1816.
It stops the extraction in 1844 and serves as ventilation for the Bonne Part and Outre Wez pits until 1879.
After some unsuccessful attempts, the installation was commissioned in 1823.
A fan was temporarily installed on the well during the repair of the Old Machine pit.
Located a few hundred meters from the center of the town of Vieux-Cond√©, but in the territory of Fresnes-sur-Escaut.
Dark in 1822 in Abscon, the pit La Pens√©e began to produce in 1824.
The pit will then be used for the ventilation of the Saint Mark pit at Escaudain, a few hundred meters away.
Abscon is at the limit of the concessions of the mining companies of Anzin, Azincourt and Aniche.
After its closure, the deposit will be taken over by the Dutemple and Success pits.
The pit pit Successful is located in the territory of Saint-Waast, a hamlet of Valenciennes.
The pit quickly concentrated the productions of the pits of the R√©gie, Ernest and Tinchon.
The search was unsuccessful and at that time was provisionally abandoned.
But the existence of broken sections having been proved, new investigations resumed in 1826.
A year later, a second well was opened for water exhaustion and for ventilation (Villars √âpuisement).
The sinking alone was a record, having lasted less than eight months.
The ventilation was partly ensured by the R√©ussite and Desmaizi√®res wells.
It is with the Ernest pit that the last searches were completed in the "fat beam of Anzin".
Abandoned by the mining police before 1909, a mining city was established on the old pit tile (current Ernest city).
The Pit Vedette Pit was opened in 1825 at La Sentinelle.
The Saint Mark Pit is located in the immediate vicinity of downtown Abscon.
The exploitation of the Pit Jean Bart pit dates from 1831.
It is indeed that year that began digging the basement.
The precise date of the start of coal extraction is, however, unknown.
This well was exploited until 1859 is 28 years and the mine was permanently closed in 1881.
It therefore passed 22 years before the final closure of the site.
The well of the Napoleon pit was dug in 1833 in Denain.
Used as a ventilation well, Amaury was backfilled only in 1949.
To prevent the water from getting into the well it was surmounted by a concrete tower.
Today it is a simple concrete slab that covers this entrance.
Part of the pit, which had been transformed into a dwelling house, still exists.
The Renard Pit is the one in which √âmile Zola descended in 1884 before writing Germinal.
It is also in this pit that worked for 46 years the minor-poet Jules Mousseron, father of the famous Cafougnette.
On May 3, 1838, new layers are discovered, the survey is abandoned on May 6.
A bowette a hundred meters long is led to the north.
During the months of March and April 1844, the machines were dismantled and shipped to Denain.
In June and July 1844, the facilities were demolished, the well filled, and the ground cleared.
It was the third Hasnon pit, located on the territory of Wallers.
It was dug in 1841 and the extraction began there in 1859, until 1918.
The buildings of the P√©rier pit have long remained in excellent condition: they were still used until their recent demolition.
During these aforementioned demolitions of the coron Perier, we found the exact location of the well.

The Scheldt Avaleresse was opened and abandoned in 1848 at Anzin.
The pit will provide ventilation and service for the Renard Pit from that date.
A mine-image is still in the immediate vicinity of the pit tile.
The Vieux-Cond√© pit, still called "L'avaleresse de Vieux-Cond√©", has always remained known as the Avaleresse pit.
The pit, attached to the Ledoux pit of Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, will cease mining in June 1972.
Destroyed during the 1914-1918 war, surface installations were rebuilt around 1920.
Bowettes dug in the north and south meet many charcoal veins, many of which are not exploitable.
The farm ceases in 1968, when the Saint Mark grave is closed.
A few meters deep remains the mine-image although access is condemned.
The two wells of the Haveluy Pit are dark in 1866.
Wells were backfilled in 1954 and headframes destroyed in 1974.
Three wells were dug simultaneously from June 5, 1873.
The swallow of Hasnon was opened and closed in 1875 in Wallers.
At the opening, the most beautiful veins discovered are Lambrecht and Adolphine.
The pit went into operation in 1884, producing half-fat coal.
The pit is assigned as a service and ventilation well for Saint Mark.
From this pit, only one slag remains, Audiffret Sud, Audiffret Nord having been exploited since 1978.
The Cuvette Pit is a ventilation pit that is not connected to the rail network that was started southeast of Escaudain.
The two wells of the Bligni√®res pit were started in 1893 and crossed the famous Anzin torrent.

The last real recovery is in camera, Friday, March 31, a week later.
Then came the clashes at 418 in 1928, at 500 in 1928, at 580 in 1954, and 660 in December 1968.
At nationalization, the facilities of the day were modernized with the creation of a wash house and two electric extraction machines.
The start of this floor takes place in 1972.
The beginning of the extraction of a rich deposit of anthracitic coals begins in 1913.
The Saint-Georges crack is located in the Bonsecours national forest, in Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut.
This is the only split in the mining basin of Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
In the vicinity of Bonsecours, the dead lands are very thin.
In July 1961, a miniature tile was built over the manhole.
This air intake makes it possible to exploit the Saint-Georges vein, one meter thick.
The well is backfilled in 1970, and the facilities are destroyed.
The concession dates from October 24, 1835, and work is commenced immediately.
The Prime Minister and the other most important ministers sit on the Supreme Decision Committee, known as the Cabinet.
This authority is exercised only by, or on the advice of, the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
They also exercise power directly as heads of the executive departments of the government.
Most of the nations that use the Westminster system are the nations now or formerly members of the Commonwealth.
The current Prime Minister is Theresa May of the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom.
So the current Prime Minister will probably not be able to form a new government.
The Prime Minister is based at 10 Downing Street in Westminster, which is also the meeting place of the Cabinet.
Most of the government's executive departments are also located in the Whitehall district.
The validation and procedural limits of these powers are controlled by the courts as part of the review of legality.
In the United Kingdom, ministers are called Secretary of State, and most are Cabinet members.
In general, most Ministers are elected to the House of Commons rather than to the House of Lords.
In practice, the Chancellor of the Exchequer must also be a member of the Commons.
With the exception of Members of Parliament and local authorities, no public officers are elected.
According to the Constitution of the United Kingdom, the monarch has the following powers:
Many other authorities and agencies also have legal powers, usually subject to central government supervision.
The more centralized political power, the more central authority can intervene on market development.
Until 2008, he was Chairman of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Qu√©bec.
He also published numerous books on politics and culture.
It is based on culture, political ideals and policies.
Belinda Carlisle was born in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.
She is the daughter of Harold, a traveling salesman, and Joanne, a housewife.
Belinda is the eldest of seven siblings, having three brothers and three sisters.
Carlisle began a solo career, although she continues to collaborate with Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin.
This new career gives Belinda Carlisle the opportunity to forge a new image.
In 1986, she married Morgan Mason, who works in the Ronald Reagan administration.
In June 1986 released the solo album "Belinda", on the label I.R.S.
The album has some success in North America, being certified gold in the United States and platinum in Canada.
Other singles from the album are released, such as "I Feel The Magic" and "Since You've Gone".
The album is little different from the Californian pop of the time, represented in particular by the Bangles.
Other collaborators include Andy Taylor of Duran Duran, who is on guitar on the track "Mad About You".
For her second album, Carlisle is again working on the image she is projecting.
She gives up her short blonde "Californian" hair for longer, auburn hair.
Rick Nowels is hired as a producer and Thomas Dolby is the keynote part of some titles.
The first single of "Heaven on Earth" is "Heaven Is a Place on Earth", which devotes the transformation of Carlisle.
"World Without You" and "Love Never Dies" singles will be moderately successful.
It works well in Canada as well, but it is not the case in the United States.
The United States has benefited from one of the most successful stock markets of the twentieth century.
Finally, note that on the song "Whatever It Takes", Bryan Adams contributes as a singer.
In the 1990s, Belinda Carlisle released three albums that went more or less unnoticed, as well as a Best of.
She converted to Buddhism and says she stopped using tobacco, drugs or alcohol.
She moved to the south of France since the early 1990s and has been living there ever since.
In 2001, Carlisle and his old Go-Go comrades gathered for a tour.
In 2007, she released "Voila", her first studio album for more than ten years.
This album includes titles in French, including covers of Edith Piaf and Fran√ßoise Hardy.
Since 2008, she has been involved in various tours, often with bands that were her contemporaries in the 1980s.
In 2011, Carlisle played solo in Australia, where she remains more popular than in her native America.

Hoshin management- Hoshin means in Japanese what shows the right direction (Ho = direction, Shin = compass).
This is what points the direction (like the needle of the compass).
This management method contributes to the implementation of an establishment policy centered on the priority objectives.
In fact, the implementation of unconventional monetary policies has generated a significant excess of liquidity.
The goal is to provide the resources for setting up a new fast organization.
In the late 1960s, breakthrough management was structured.
The method follows the logic of the quality loop known as the "Deming Wheel" (Plan Do Check Act).
It becomes a challenge for everyone because it is a sum of individual actions for a common project.
Hoshin is a strategic process with repercussions at all levels of the company.
In the Hoshin process, goals are set by the highest authorities.
Finally, this methodical deployment of an activity, a product or a process is limited in time.
It focuses many resources on a limited number of priority actions. <br>
Each stakeholder involved must develop a strategy to achieve the top-level deployment goal.
Identify the areas of breakthrough consistent with the themes of continuous improvement:
Define ambitious and realistic goals to incorporate into daily work.
Define the means to commit the effort and obtain the consensus on the approach that will be undertaken. <br>
Each involved actor or service must develop a strategy to achieve the goal of the higher level of deployment.
Facilitate the consultation with its own employees, with the other departments involved, those responsible for transversal processes, its line manager ... <br>
This process is evolutionary and it follows the PDCA principle (called Deming Wheel):
It is an anticipatory approach and a way of efficiently managing important projects for the company.
This diagnosis plays a key role in Breakthrough Management.
The President conducts this audit in person, announced one year in advance.
He listens to the team and checks the progress of the process. <br>
It is a mark of interest and a source of enrichment and exchange for all.
The Hoshin technique is part of a progressive and constant improvement policy. <br>
The duration can be fatal if we are not careful to keep the system alive. <br>
Certain conditions are necessary for the smooth running of this project:
The members of the "Christuskirche" live throughout the √éle-de-France.
The funding of parish activities is different from the German system.
Unlike the German churches, the churches in France are associations, which must finance themselves.
Expenses consist of salaries for pastors and the secretariat, maintenance of buildings and between aid.
The preparation of the parish bulletin is also a significant expense.
Contributions and donations give rise to the establishment of receipts for tax deductions from the French or German tax authorities.
The beginnings of the Church are at the Swedish Embassy in Paris.
The first pastor, Jonas Hambraeus, also took care of the many Germans, mostly refugees from the Thirty Years' War.
With the expulsion and emigration of the Huguenots (the French Reformed) the social structure of the German parish was changing profoundly.
Theologian and Alsatian historian Baer is the representative of the ascension of the parish.
But finally the Revolution will facilitate the integration of foreigners and legalize Protestantism.
From 1821, the number of German immigrants increased so much that a German worship service will be celebrated every Sunday.
Under Louis-Philippe, whose daughter-in-law and therefore potential queen, was a German Lutheran princess, the Lutheran church reached its peak.
For political and economic reasons, thousands of Germans come to Paris.
Street sweepers come almost exclusively from Hesse.
Poverty is great, industrialization attracts workers and laborers, who live in homes of misery.
Pastor Meyer created the "German Evangelical Mission" as a first aid institution, co-financed by Germany.
From 1858 to 1864 the great organizer of mutual aid Friedrich von Bodelschwingh is a pastor in Paris.
The defeat of France in 1871 led to the definitive break:
In 1879 a compromise was found, but that remained provisional.
From 1888 the new Emperor Wilhelm II (William II) pursued a more active foreign policy.
The German parish was to have a nationalist orientation, and to be independent.
His supporters favored the creation of an independent parish in the center of Paris.
From 1905 it is, like all the churches in France a "cult association".
In 1911 the building of the church "White Street" is completed by halls, an office and housing for the pastor.
As a result, the beginning of the war in 1914 meant the end of the parish.
The churches were confiscated, the majority of the members returned to Germany, all institutions and associations were closed.
The global economic crisis is significantly affecting the German parish.
The global economic crisis has barely helped to mask the chronic structural imbalances of the region.
At the heart of the global economic crisis, there is above all a growth crisis.
As a result of the global economic crisis, emerging markets have become the engines of global growth.
The parish life is concentrated on White Street, the other churches will be sold.
On the other side it hosts refugees and people persecuted by the Nazi regime.
In 1945 it is again the collapse: the Germans leave the city, the buildings are again requisitioned.
From 1948 the remaining Germans received support from the Lutheran Refugee Assistance Committee (CLAIR).
It will be the home of all German-speaking Christians of all Protestant denominations.
Julien Pouchard, born in 1656 in Passais and died on December 12, 1705, is a French teacher and journalist.
Julien Pouchard made his first studies at Le Mans, at the Fathers of the Oratory, and finished them at the college of Lisieux.
Some time later, he entrusted to him the government of the young pupils who received a free education in his establishment.
Secondary education is free, with institutions all over the country.
Pouchard, who did not neglect his particular studies, soon had the opportunity to show his great knowledge.
Pouchard worked for several years on the Greek manuscripts of the King's Library, editing and correcting defective texts.
Still very poor, he entered the Marquis de Marseliere, who entrusted him with the education of his son.
This young man being dead, the steward of the finances Caumartin gave him as governor to his only son, Antoine-Louis de Saint-Ange.
In 1701, the new regulations of the Academy of Inscriptions opened the doors of this body, first as an associate member.
His profound erudition, in his memoirs on "the Antiquity of the Egyptians" and on the "Liberalities of the Roman people," was soon noticed.
The "History of the Academy of Inscriptions" analyzes one of these memoirs devoted to the obelisks of Sesostris.
At the creation of the "Journal des Savans", the management was entrusted to Julien Pouchard.
There was therefore a serious debate on this point, in which the editor of the "Journal des savans" had to intervene.
As reserved as they were, his conclusions not being favorable to the professor of rhetoric, Gibert replied bitterly.
De Sacy made even more noise about an article on his "Treaty of Friendship."
It has not been printed since the death of Pouchard, and the fate of his manuscript is unknown.
It will be Karl Baedeker's policy to publish most of his guides in three languages: German, English and French.
Thus the Baedeker guide is probably the travel guide having gained the greatest notoriety in the world.
Finally, it focuses on the regular updating of information.
The great interest of this collection, at the time, was to present the transport facilities that rail provided.
It was at this time that the different countries studied with great interest the financial models developed elsewhere.
Karl Baedeker writes a large part of the guides and reviews all the titles before they are published.
Today, some of these guides are highly sought after by collectors.
This point is the place of a correspondence between the higher and lower realms.
In some Polynesian cultures, the banyan tree (from the fig tree family of pagodas) is home to ancestral spirits.
In the Hindu religion, the banyan is considered sacred and called "Ashwath Vriksha".
It represents eternal life because of the impressive growth of its branches.
Economic growth has been impressive, and life is definitely improving.
The Yggdrasil, site of Odin's illumination, fulfills the same symbolic function in Nordic mythology.
The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge present in Genesis represent two aspects of the same picture.
They are each supposed to stand in the center of a Garden of Eden which flows four rivers that irrigate the entire world.
The Christmas tree, whose origins refer to pre-Christian European beliefs, is also a representation of the axis mundi.
The symbolism of the axis mundi can be applied to the human body.
It is also a fundamental principle of Yoga and Tai Chi.
Axis Mundi is referred to in episode 16 of Season 5 of the television series "Supernatural".
The fourth and last of these levels is called "Axis Mundi".
The first episode of season 2 of "The Leftovers" is entitled "Axis Mundi".
Thanks to the political friendships of his father, he became mayor of the municipality of Mon√≥var, in the province of Alicante, in 1833.
The troubled regency of Marie Christine de Bourbon propels it to the forefront of national political life.
Energy policy is defined at the national level, while the externalities of the sector are global.
In 1837, after the pronunciamento of La Granja, he was elected to the new parliament as deputy of Malaga.
Once settled in Madrid, he shows great talents for negotiation.
In 1839 he obtained a monopoly on salt and began investing in the Madrid Stock Exchange.
The liberal revolution of 1854 chases it again in fantastic conditions.
This railroad from Madrid to Aranjuez is the first of a long series.
Located in the center-west of the capital, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, it is part of the district of Almadies.
The name of the district Mermoz pays homage to Jean Mermoz, French pilot, legendary figure of A√©ropostale.
With Ngor, Ouakam and Yoff, she is part of the district of Almadies, in the department of Dakar.
Most of Senegal's ethnic groups are represented, but Capverdians, Guineans and Beninese also live in Mermoz-Sacr√©-Coeur.
The municipality is facing housing and environmental problems, aggravated by the high population growth.
On the other hand, the problems created by too rapid population growth are rooted in real and unavoidable constraints.
Some people live in total destitution, while others live in luxurious villas.
In 2010, the town is beset by people who can not find where to build, the city center becoming saturated.
The system could then be used to guide the bombers on their targets.
When this strategy failed, the air effort was redirected to serve the anti-infiltration strategy.
"Rolling Thunder" was also an expensive operation and not just financially.
The physical barrier would have been equipped with electronic sensors and large minefields.
Fisher estimated that this would require approximately five US divisions to erect and defend this system.
The original plan provided for the deployment of a physical barrier in addition to an air barrier based on several electronic sensors.
On June 6, the launch ceremonies for the project were celebrated from the command center of the operation.
Since its creation, the ISC (and the operations it directed) was known as the "Task Force Alpha".
The research and development program of the Defense Communications Planning Group had created a state-of-the-art technology system.
The first consists of acoustic and seismic sensors battery released by air.
The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped by series at predetermined geographical points along the VANPA logistics network.
Once in place, they were to serve as a trigger as soon as a movement or activity was detected by the system.
The first seismic detector model (Phase I) outperformed these contemporary acoustic systems in the quality and quantity of information it processed.
Thirty-one channels were assigned to each sensor type with 375 kilohertz (kHz) separation between each channel.
All channels contained 27 identification codes or addresses, which could be entered before the sensors were put in place.
The deployment of button mines and anti-personnel mines became an integral part of the operation.
But they fear the deployment of a missile defense system targeting exclusively the neighbors of Turkey.
Other weapons were specifically developed or associated with the campaign.
The sensors were designed to be dropped by air in two different ways.
The first was to parachute the sensor, which ended up landing in the trees and melted among the foliage.
Surprisingly, about 80 percent of the sensors dropped by these methods were found in working order after landing.
By the end of 1969, Phase IV sensors were beginning to be deployed in the theater of operations.
The center's technicians controlled the system on different screens that were connected to the computers.
For example, a well-placed chain with several defective sensors was more effective than an operational chain in the wrong place.
The exploitation of the collected electronic data was, however, possible thanks to the skills of analysts and human operators of the SAI.
US fighter planes were directed to planned target areas through a variety of means.
As the program (and the air defenses of the APVN) evolved, the relay aircraft did the same.
The aircraft, however, suffered from mechanical problems and was never sent on a pilotless operational mission.
On November 25, 1967, "Muscle Shoals" began to undergo field and evaluation tests in southeastern Laos.
The Marines estimated that 40 per cent of the information available at the Khe Sahn Fire Support Coordination Center came from sensors.
General Westmoreland was excited about the Task Force Alpha's contribution to Khe Sanh's victory.
He was indeed one of the only senior military officers to have supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa barrier since the beginning.
For the next four years, "Igloo White" and "Commando Hunt" were going to be interconnected in the anti-infiltration effort.
With the arrival of "Igloo White" / "Commando Hunt" operations, the air harassment effort entered a new phase.
This does not mean that the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft carrying out the missions.
Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh Air Force by collecting, analyzing and disseminating intelligence.
The ABCCC were also under the control of the Seventh Air Force and not the Alpha Task Force.
A technical error, however, would have huge consequences for the entire program.
The mines were deteriorating too quickly because of the heat and humidity in Laos, which compromised the system.
The North Vietnamese response to the threat created by the sensors was straightforward.
If the APVN troops could detect the location of a sensor, they would immediately start looking for others to destroy them.
The last idea among anti-sensor measures had been to try to deceive them.
A combined force of a single regiment of the Marine Corps and a single ARVN regiment was to hold these positions.
On 28 January 1968, COMUSMACV communicated its own orders for the planning of the creation of the ARVN's "Dyemarker" Regiment.
COMUSMACV envisaged a regiment composed of 5 battalions of 4 companies each plus an armored cavalry squadron.
The loss of life for the APVN / NLF was high, but it was a price that Hanoi was willing and able to pay.
She questioned not only the reliability of the sensors, but the adequacy of the entire system.
The Pacific Air Force command then launched an apparent failure investigation and said "our estimates were wrong".
"Igloo White" cost about $ 1 billion a year in operating costs.
The cost of bombing operations was approximately $ 18.3 million per week.
These costs did not include the hundreds of planes lost during the air campaign or the invaluable teams flying them.
This was understandable because the Vietnamese were rather quiet during the 1970s and 1980s.
Only the opening of the Vietnamese archives to the researchers will reveal the real efficiency (or lack of efficiency) of the American electronic and air effort.
But the Constitution goes even further by recognizing the right of suffrage to foreigners under certain conditions:
The conditions for being a first degree elector or citizen are:
Citizens meet as part of a primary assembly to elect voters.
The concern is always to remove the popular masses, ignorant of public things.
Citizenship as defined in the Constitution of Year VIII is largely taken up in the Constitution of Year III.
However, in the Constitution of the year VIII is excluded the suffrage and is restored universal suffrage.
The system invented by Siey√®s looks like a pyramid on three floors:
The appointment replaces the election and above all allows the government to control both the administration and the legislature
The rights of citizens to form these colleges are strengthened, at least at the cantonal level.
Voters have the right to elect justices at the cantonal level.
But in reality the role of citizens and these constituencies is very passive and limited.
For district colleges, voters must choose from among the 600 wealthiest citizens.
Voters must choose between a left-wing coalition and a right-wing coalition.
The bourgeoisie becomes by this measure one of the social foundations of the Napoleonic regime.
In 1804, the suffrage is the same as under the life consulate.
At the same time, it presupposes popular sovereignty, which is exercised through plebiscites.
The sovereign people are consulted and approve the amendment of the Constitution.
In 1814, a good example of compromise of the constitutional monarchy, it is the suffrage censitaire.
To be eligible, the conditions are even stricter and require:
The annual income of a worker is therefore lower than the requirement to be eligible.
In addition, elections are controlled by the government in many ways.
In such conditions can we always speak of concessions to the revolution?
Dominique Barberi was born in a modest family of peasants of Lazio.
He was received by the Passionists in 1814 under the name of "Dominic of the Mother of God".
In Rome, he met Georges Spencer, who lived there from 1830 to 1832.
He founded in 1840 the first passionate house outside Italy: in Ere (Belgium), near Tournai.
He is very interested in the Oxford Movement, and maintains a dialogue with its members.
In 1841 he wrote his famous "Letter to Oxford Teachers", which John Henry Newman studied with great care.
This letter was published at the time in French in the newspaper l'Univers.
For example, a newspaper published a letter accusing Toledo of using drugs.
In 1842 he founded the first house in England at Aston Hall (Staffordshire).
In the 1840s, while on a mission to Stone, he led the conversion of Elizabeth Prout.
Randall Jarrell (May 6, 1914 - October 15, 1965), is a poet, writer and critic of the United States.
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Randall Jarrell is educated at Vanderbilt University.
He teaches in several universities the latest being the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He published "Blood from a Stranger", his first collection of poems, in 1942.
The same year, he was incorporated into the US Air Force, where he worked at the control tower.
He also published a satirical novel, "Pictures from an Institution", in 1954, on teaching at the university.
There followed a few years of teaching at the University of Pennsylvania and finally Columbia.
Encouraged by Edmund Wilson, he publishes literary reviews in "The New Republic".
He thus contributes to the works of Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and William Carlos Williams.
He also had a great deal of admiration for Walt Whitman, Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens, who influenced him.
He was a poetry consultant for the Library of Congress between 1956 and 1958.
He also writes children's books: "The Gingerbread Rabbit", "The Bat-Poet" (1964) and "The Animal Family" (1965).
Oscar Fanyau also acquired the rest of the property from:
Building built around 1905, Place de la R√©publique, Marcelin Krebs being mayor.
The division of property, made with his sister Adolphine took place on March 29, 1873 (Reuflet to Ascq).

The origin of previous property is such that for the land used for the construction of the old town hall.
The grounds of the current Place Hentg√®s had been approached for their reconstruction.
The property had been acquired by the sellers in two parts:
Former cinema "The Kursaal" bought by the city in 1975 to serve as a theater.
At the beginning of its implantation in Hellemmes, the Leo-Lagrange club had its seat there.
A general renovation to make it a real theater that took over the old name of Kursaal in 2006.
Building used by school built before 1905 and comprising three classes.
The walls were mounted on part of the old cemetery and part of the old church.
An archaeological survey was conducted by the department in June and July 2001 (see the chapter on the church of Saint-Denis).
The frame, of origin, was all pegged wood, reinforcements nails and irons are later.
The walls are said with error of Spanish construction (limestone beds interspersed with bricks).
These last materials are local: the stones of Lezennes, the bricks of Hellemmoise manufacture.
The cessation of this activity comes essentially from a problem of people.
The transfer of the "library" activity was done during the last quarter of 1997.
The First World War was to put it to sleep until after the Second World War.
During the last war, barracks were installed on the ground to accommodate the families affected.
The liberation of these barracks was achieved by the creation, in 1966, of the social relocation program (rue Pierre-Curie).
The replacement of old barracks with more functional premises was carried out in 1974, 1977, 1979 and 1981.
In 1976, 234 Jacquard Street, adjacent to the property, was purchased from the Family Allowance Fund, which was demolished in 1977.
In 2001, a new gym, with no shooting, is envisaged.
The main contractor is the firm Otton, Sanchez, Loiez (represented by Loiez) of Lambersart.
This is the construction of a room to cover three pre-existing tennis courts.

An agreement of use has been passed with the Hellenic Tennis Club for a period of twenty years.
Built in 1981 under the responsibility of G. and A. Fauchille, architects at Hellemmes.
During the study of a redevelopment plan for the city center, the problem of public facilities arose.
In 1982, a socio-cultural center project was to be integrated into this framework.
A study by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry highlighted the opportunity of opening a covered market (1987).
The project developed two years later added, on the floor, a multipurpose room.
The ground floor of the premises had to make room for an exhibition room, a kitchen, a nursery stop.
Built for SCI Guinguette by the company Fauvel Habitat de Wasquehal; architects Guy Fauchille and Philippe Guittard d'Hellemmes.
She returned to Aniche in 1950 and was removed to the pit Wallers-Arenberg (North) and Vieux-Cond√© (North) until 1982.
She was then transported to the Anzin Railway depot at Bruay-sur-l'Escaut.
By finishing her career at Hellemmes, she returns to her point of departure.
Formerly installed in the old workshop of the forges of F.C.B., this hammer dates from 1870.
It was classified in the technical and industrial heritage of historical monuments on November 3, 1986.
Mechanical forging machine acting by shock and operating with steam or compressed air.
The Th√©√¢tre de Verdure was built in 1934 at the end of today's Place Hentg√®s.
All kinds of shows were held there: dance, concerts, awards, etc.
This was also the place where the name change ceremony took place on Sadi-Carnot Street in Roger-Salengro Street.
It was destroyed in 1975 to give place, partly and later, to the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAcacias.
All of the lands depended on the property of the Sainte Marthe Hospital and the Charit√© de Lille General Hospital.
They were reunited by royal edict in 1750 to be transferred to the charity office of Lille.

The surrendered land was previously the union of two parcels containing respectively 79 ares 74 centiares and 17 ares 72 centiares.
It was passed on to Mrs. Cocheteux born Marie Dubar by succession.
Subsequently, the cemetery had to be enlarged several times (including in 1905 and 1921).
Under the old regime, the parish clerk had many functions including teaching.
He had to teach the children to read, write, count, teach them catechism, and so on.
The first known parish clerk is Jacquemart Crespel, quoted in a tax survey in 1491.
It is the object of vexations and violence, the population preferring the former priest.
Before the Second World War, there were only two school groups in Hellemmes that were badly hit by the bombings:
After the bombing of January 13, 1943, all schools had to be closed.
Only Jean Jaur√®s and Salengro could be reopened in October 1944.

Construction began late 1932 on plans by Architect Cools
Mr Descamps had become the owner of the property as explained below.
When the property of Auguste Descamps was shared on July 12, 1898, the land was allocated to Jules Descamps.
The establishment of these schools conditioned the opening of the Anatole-France street.
A plan, drawn up by Guy Fauchille, architect at Hellemmes, is dated September 8, 1955.
The maternal part in the S√©vign√© school (already called Jenner) was thus transferred to new premises.

In 1939, the government forced SNCF to train apprentices in 12 months.
The set was bought and built by the City in 1984, sold a few years later.
They are given here for information purposes, the denominations and functions of each may vary over time.
In addition to the evolution of the population, the organization of the town hall, as an administration has also undergone various changes.
At the end of the last century, it was decided to build the "old town hall" in the center of a new district.
Finally, in April 1921, the municipal services were housed in the current "castle" and in the annex (former stables).
The vicissitudes of the Second World War caused the service to move to the Camp de Vacances.
The current organization chart was introduced in mimicry with that of Lille, in 1996.
The Environment and Public Services department is split into two parts: a Buildings-Buildings-Logistics department and an Environment department.
The same remark as for the previous paragraph also applies here.
What applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions.
A quota of 10% of seats is reserved for the Hellenic institutions (12 members).

Created by deliberation of the Communal Council dated October 8, 1999.
In addition, the following extra-municipal commissions are created or renewed:
Born in 1992, the main axis of this association took its current form in 1992.
Its axis is the fight against illiteracy and a homework help with a supervision of volunteers.
It is subsidized by the Municipality of Hellemmes and the Caisse d'Allocations Familiales of Lille.
Created in 1999, it consists of 3 working groups:
Created in 1997 and installed in the former baths rue Jules Guesde
From the 1920s, a need for skilled labor was felt in France.
This task is the responsibility of the Information and Orientation Centers that succeed O.O.P.
An annex to the C.I.O is located on Hellemmes in 1957 and will become autonomous in 1974.
being created on Villeneuve d'Ascq, the one located in our commune becomes the current C.I.O.
Installed in 1971 in the former school Carnot, he was transferred rue de l'Innovation.
In 1935, the Dominicans of the Holy Angels replaced the nuns of Saint Vincent de Paul.
The accompaniment of the dying and the burial were also part of the activities of the nuns.
The nuns leave gradually to take care of other missions; they settle at 11 rue Charles Saint Venant

At the corner of Ferdinand-Mathias and Innovation Streets, the construction of the Nord Departmental Media Library began in 1993.
Normal track material comes from Romania, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
Traction is entrusted to a number of companies created for the occasion.
The BR Series 37 consists of 309 mixed locomotives built from 1960 to 1965.
Originally, they form the series D 6600 to 6608 and D 6700 to 6999.
During the passages in major revisions, many are modified in the 1980s, giving rise to several sub-series.
After BR privatization, they are shared between EWS, DRS, Fragonet, HRNC, West Coast Railway Company, Riviera Train, and Eurostar.
Many class 37 are thus involved in the construction of the LGV M√©diterran√©e in France.
Continental Rail signs a contract to lease 14 machines in November 2000.
The first unit is officially presented in Thornaby in April 2001.
The L 33 had already done service in France in 1999/2000.
In Salillas del Jalon they tow ballast trains to Calatayud and Zaragoza.
L 21 and L 24 derail in the suburbs of Zaragoza on March 26, 2002.
Shipped to the Vias y Construcciones depot in Madrid for repairs, they are quickly parked and cut on site in July 2003.
The L 32, also hilly, is cut at Calatayud at the same time.
The eleven survivors are all paid to the WZKS-EWS pool in 2004.
At that time, they are still working on the AVE line, some involved in the construction of the Huesca branch.
At present, there is no article on the service of class 37 in Spain.
At present, productivity in services is six times lower than in industry.
During this university period, she belongs to the first selection of the United States in 1985.
The United States, which has experienced a long period of growth without savings, is a case in point.
She scored fifteen goals in 24 games with the US team between 1985 and 1990.
In 1992, she set a record for the competition by scoring 43 goals and winning with her club the Swedish championship.
Despite her illness, she is a major member of her national team.
In 1991, she took part in the first FIFA Women's World Cup, organized by FIFA in China.
She left the professional competition in 2000, shortly before the Sydney Olympics.
In the jersey of the United States, she scored a total of 105 goals.
It is part of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.
The "eternal order of the fields", adds P√©cout, is not a reality.
Politicization can indeed play the role of integrator within liberal democratization and the nation.
At that time, Italian society was divided into two separate layers: the ruling class and the peasantry.
We must speak of both: there are not only peasants in the country.
The ruling class in the countryside ("possidenti") et l'√âglise influencing effet les peursants (cf.
"The Cheetah", even if out of season), and to understand the Italian countryside at that time, we need an overview.
We are even reduced to looking for heat in the stables in winter.
There are two possibilities: the rural exodus to unwelcoming and already saturated cities or revolt.
Thus we witness looting, destruction of registers and occupations that are without "precise political significance".
Campaigns to play a role in political and social developments have had to find derivatives (public discussions).
Political choices will also have their role to play in the financial troubles of Argentina.
In the 1830s and 1840s, the pre-unitary elites dreamed of a unified economy that went through the modernization of the countryside.
The South hardly benefits, as the modernization mentioned above.
A voodoo doll is a doll representing the spirit of a person used to cast spells on him.
This supposedly magical object, now a stereotype of witchcraft, is often represented in popular culture.
Popular culture can often be an important source of "soft" power.
Dolls do not appear as such in voodoo.
The faithful offer dolls on the altars of Erzulie, but they do not aim to bewitch.
Wangas or ouangas, however, allow to cast spells (sickness, failure, breakup ...) without going to the death.
However, they take the form of bundled packages containing several ingredients, not dolls.
Bokors are voodoo sorcerers who are known to cast spells.
In the French West Indies, packages to captivate people are called quimbois.
In black magic, the doll is stitched with needles, cut or burned in some places.
The target person is supposed to suffer at the places where the doll was hit.
A character from "L√†-bas" (1891) by Joris-Karl Huysmans is said to be bewitched.
In his novel "The Mesmer is in the Stairs" (1985), Mr. Lebrun tells a revenge made using a doll pierced with needles.
The image of the dolls sometimes accompanies the representations of voodoo to fantastic cinema.
In "Child's Play", a serial killer invokes voodoo to bewitch a doll.
Many other films, however, present the ensorting dolls outside the voodoo culture.
Thus in "The House that kills" where a little girl makes a figurine with candles to torture her father.
In the Italian film "Blue Holocaust", a woman kills another with the help of a voodoo doll.
Or the movie "", where Captain Black Beard uses a doll to control Jack Sparrow.
The "Voodoo Manual" is therefore within the limits of freedom of expression.
The current system incorporates older rivers and canals, as well as new achievements.
The bad news is that those who benefit from the current system are opposed to progress.
Among the rivers, Bega, Brzava, Mostonga and Kara≈° are partly integrated into the canal.
The Krivaja flows into the canal and the Zlatica is connected to the network by the Kikinda canal.
After studying in Milan during the years of fascism, Danilo Dolci developed a deep aversion to dictatorship.
Arrested in Genoa in 1943 by the Nazis, he managed to flee.
Danilo Dolci is considered one of the most important figures of non-violence in the world.
In his militant actions, Danilo Dolci has consistently used the tools of non-violence.
He decides to set up a similar community himself, Ceffarello.
The authorities close Nomadelfia and Ceffarello, transferring the orphans to state structures.
Sweet to tell stories like the "Gandhi de Sicilia".
His strike ends when the authorities make a public commitment to carry out some urgent projects, such as building a sewer system.
This action allows him to get in touch with the Perugino philosopher Aldo Capitini.
Hundreds of unemployed get organized to repair an abandoned country road.
The police put an end to the protest, calling it "obstruction".
This event provokes outrage across the country and causes many questions in parliament.
Nominated person's apportent leur soutien √† Dolci, dont les √©crivains Ignazio Silone, Alberto Moravia, and Carlo Levi.
Released, he resumed his campaign to build the dam and economic development of this miserable region.
Over the years, support for Dolci has been consolidated both nationally and internationally.
During the 1960s, the international monetary order became the object of a fierce political struggle.
Dolci's working method is an important feature of his social and educational work.
His vision of progress values ‚Äã‚Äãlocal culture and skills, the contribution of each community and each person.
To achieve this, Dolci integrated the Socratic method with his own methods.
During meetings led by Dolci, everyone questions, learns to confront others, to listen and to decide.
Ten years later, he fights to help the victims of the earthquake in the Belice Valley in Sicily.
Since the 1970s, educational commitment has been central to Dolci's work.
Thanks to the contributions of international experts, it starts the experience of the "Mirto educational center", attended by hundreds of children.
A constraint is a relationship between several variables that limit the set of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat these variables can take simultaneously.
We call assignment, associating a value of its domain to a variable.
When looking for solutions to a problem of satisfaction of constraints, one can wish for example:
However, this is impractical for medium size problems because of the large number of possible combinations.
Many medium-sized banks and some large banks will plunge with the turmoil of the stock market.
One of the major parts of the resolution, called "filtering", aims to avoid this exhaustive enumeration.
It consists in deducing from the constraints the impossible values.
When a variable has only one candidate, it is instantiated (i.e.
This series of breakdowns of the problem can be represented as a tree.
It is called local consistency to verify that certain variables do not violate the constraints that are linked to it.
This makes it possible to filter some impossible values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a reduced cost.
There are several local consistencies, each offering a different balance between filtering efficiency and speed of computation.
Typical problems that can be addressed by constraint programming include:
Neurotoxicity is the action of a poison (or neurotoxic substance) on the nervous system.
It can be chemical elements such as heavy metals, chemical compounds or biological substances such as neurotoxins.
However, the lack of heart rate regulation by the autonomic nervous system can result in bradycardia or tachycardia.
These products are active at very low doses on the fetus or embryo with irreversible effects.
Asset purchases have no impact on the balance sheet because assets replace money.
The currently most used antidotes consist of a combination of atropine and avizafone.
Man or animal are exposed "via" air, water, soil.
This is particularly the case of cocaine, alcohol, MDMA and amphetamine.
Alcohol is one of the most neurotoxic psychotropic known, eventually causing the cell death of neurons.
However, the distinction between "concentration camp" and "coercive labor camp" remains purely theoretical.
At the end of the civil war, the Soviet concentration camp system deeply changed.
Is their goal to end the civil war or to bring about regime change?
The concept of "work camp" for common law prisoners is developed.
Noticeable difference with the future Gulag: these labor camps are not yet a link in the Soviet economy.
Founded in 1429, first one and then several monasteries were built on these islands.
However, with the arrival of the Bolsheviks, the fate of these islands changed.
Indeed, transformed into a concentration camp in 1920, the camp received tens of thousands of prisoners including socialists.
From 1929, the concentration camp system experienced a series of brutal evolutions.
This controversy joins a broader debate on the peculiarity of Stalinism vis-√†-vis Bolshevism.

In many countries, the greyhound race is amateurish and is made for the entertainment of the public.
There is also a greyhound racing world championship.
In France the first race was organized by Eug√®ne Chapus in Bagatelle on November 28, 1879.
In 1933 a decree authorized the operation of pari-mutuel betting on greyhound racing.
The Courbevoie cynodrome will operate from 1936 to 1951, the date of the closure of this cynodrome.
For 10 years the mutual wager remained banned and in 1961, at the initiative of Jacques Verchere, he was again authorized.
It was not until the mid-1970s that new cynodrome reopened: Mont de Marsan, Carnoux-en-Provence etc.
Greyhound racing companies are run by a French Federation of Greyhound Racing Societies (FFSCL).
In 1985, the most recent period, the FFSCL had 22 affiliated companies.
In 2007, greyhound racing continues in many countries around the world.
In many countries, the ongoing reconstruction is not complete.
In France, greyhound racing is often practiced by greyhounds belonging to individuals, in an official setting.
There may be financial issues but there is no racing industry behind these meetings.
They are then "reformed" and proposed for adoption by associations.
The greyhound equipment consists of two essential things:
In South Africa, dogs are kept by their owners.
Pastor Chebance blessed some dogs to win competitions and was sentenced to imprisonment.
Finally, Antoniotti, the famous greyhound, was tested positive for guronsan, notably provided by Chief Sergeant Jipex.
He was born on April 20, 1741 in Talarrubias and died in today's Ciudad Bol√≠var on October 17, 1804.
It plays an important role in the introduction of coffee culture in Venezuela.
And no one plays a more important role in creating such a public climate otherwise Vladislav Surkov.
It was Fran√ßois Van Belle of Li√®ge who was the president and Maurice Bologne, the secretary.
Fernand Schreurs, Arille Carlier, Eugene Duchesne, Englebert Renier (etc.) are also members.
He even considered turning into a Party bringing together all the left in Wallonia.
He studied with the liberal Fernand Schreurs and the socialist Fernand Dehousse the future status of Wallonia.
Some mention the participation of 250 members throughout Wallonia in this work.
The idea is then abandoned in favor of a meeting in France where however Wallonia would retain the autonomy of a separate community.
The movement will finally be divided on issues such as the opportunity to turn the movement into a party (option by Fernand Dehousse).
His coalition was divided on this issue and his party lost regional elections.
What is striking is the convergence of ideas between people of liberal sensibility and people of socialist sensibility.
The Encyclopedia of the Walloon Movement devotes several pages to the study of this movement on pages 1339-1345 of its Volume III.
The natives of Quebec are the first inhabitants of the territory of the province of Quebec in Canada.
They consist of eleven distinct nations by ethnicity, language, culture and history:
They belong to three linguistic families: the Algonquian, Iroquoian and Eskimo-Aleut languages.
The Inuit of Quebec, called Nunavimiut, are located in fourteen northern villages.
Inuit live along the coast in Nunavik and are divided into three main groups:
Itivimiut living along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay,
Taqramiut living along the southern shore of Hudson Strait and
They are the only representatives of the language family of the Askimo-Aleut languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Quebec.
Amerindian nations include eight Algonquian nations and two Iroquian nations.
These include the Mohawks in the Montreal area and the Hurons in the Quebec City area.
Native Americans live primarily in reserves or institutions administered by a band council.
The Abenaki live mainly in two communes, Odanak and W√¥linak, near Trois-Rivi√®res.
Algonquins live primarily in ten communities in Abitibi-T√©miscamingue and one in the Outaouais.
Attikameks live primarily in three communities in the Mauricie region.
The Crees of Quebec live in Jam√©sie and Nunavik.
The Malecites of Quebec live mainly in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region.
The Micmacs of Quebec live mainly in the Gasp√©sie region.
70% of them live in one of the nine Montagnais communities located on the North Shore.
They live mainly in the C√¥te-Nord region near Schefferville.
Only the Mohawks (Mohawks) and the Huron-Wendat who represent this linguistic family in Quebec remain.
The Iroquoians are distinguished from the Algonquians by their sedentary lifestyle and the practice of agriculture.
Good yields sometimes allowed the accumulation of reserves and surplus which favored a certain concentration of populations.
On the other hand, hunting and fishing had to supplement and diversify this diet.
In the villages, the longhouses were home to five to ten families of the same matrilineal lineage.
From the political point of view, a confederal system was the form of organization favored by these Iroquoians.
The Iroquois people were actually a confederation of Iroquoian-speaking nations, first five and then six nations.
The Iroquois were enemies of the French until the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701.
The Wendats (formerly the "Hurons") live near Quebec City.
Their home country was located in Ontario near Lake Simcoe.
The Wendat lived in "long houses"; there were 10 to 100 per village.
The Wendat fed on fish, game and vegetables.
In Quebec, it is the most eastern and longest powerful ethnic group that is present: the Mohawks.
But since the Iroquois are mostly American and English-speaking citizens, the English adaptation of their name has long been imposed.
Today, these three Mohawk centers in Quebec are the direct heirs.
Many others enlisted in the American army during several wars, including that of Vietnam.
However, since the mid-1950s, their population has been growing steadily.
In the years 2000 and 2010, they make up 1% of the Quebec population.
A first trading post was opened in Tadoussac in 1600 and a second in Quebec City in 1608.
The fur trade and the demographic decline of several tribes cause interminable wars between nations.
For example, Champlain has accompanied his Innu, Algonquin and Huron allies against the Iroquois three times.
All these inter-tribal wars will end with the Great Peace of Montreal, in 1701.
The rivalry between French and British for the control of the fur trade finally ends with the Conquest of 1760.
However, the arrival of the British does not put an end to the various alliances adopted during the French Regime.
On the contrary, the Conquest places the Amerindians in a position of strength in front of the new occupant.
In just a few years, the forest industry has become the nerve center of Qu√©bec's economic development.
From 1820, military and economic partners, Amerindians become a social problem that must be resolved at the earliest.
The assimilation to the colonial civilization becomes the tool advocated by the British.
Lands reserved for the use of the Amerindians, taken from their own territories, are delimited.
By building up these reserves, it is hoped to gain easier access to mineral resources.
In addition, it was necessary to define a legal status for these Indians.
In 1850, therefore, the term "Indian" was fairly flexible and inclusive.
However, as early as the following year, Parliament changed the criteria to make them much more restrictive.
The law had to be more respectful of the civilizing values ‚Äã‚Äãof the conquerors.
A few years later, in 1857, a law was adopted which openly aimed at the assimilation of natives.
In doing so, he became a citizen in the same way as the others.
In reality, obtaining this title of ownership by an emancipated Indian allowed the bursting of communities from within.
Tribal governments had lost exclusive control over reserve lands.
The Act to Encourage Gradual Civilization was also another step toward government control of Indian status decisions.
This abundance of new energy will enable the creation of the aluminum industry and the accelerated development of the pulp and paper sector.
The creation of new bubbles is not the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour government's development.
All of these changes are irreversibly upsetting Quebec's hunting, fishing and trapping activities.
Starting in 1950, several new reserves were added to the 24 already existing in Quebec.
The loss of Aboriginal cultural identity is then pushed to its climax.
Surprised by the magnitude and ardor of opposition to this program, the government had to withdraw its proposal in 1970.
Thus, the Indian Act, essentially unchanged, remains in effect today.
In 1763, New France was ceded to England, which created, by the Royal Proclamation, the province of Quebec.
Between Rupert's Land and the newly created province, an Indian domain is inserted.
After 1774, the subsequent laws of 1791 and 1867 did not change the northern boundary of the province.
In 1875, a law was passed providing for the division of the NWT into provisional districts.
It is under this law that the district of Ungava is created.
In 1898, Quebec took steps to extend its territory further north.
The Cree Bands of James Bay were then under two territorial jurisdictions.
The federal government invokes their difficult inventory and the strategic importance for navigation, trade and defense.
In the 1960s, the study commission on the integrity of the Quebec territory looked into the question of these peripheral islands.
This study highlights that, for a purely geographical reason, the islands should have been integrated into the province.
Now, the shore, or more precisely the foreshore where the action of the tides is exercised, is not a fixed and fixed territorial limit.
After many steps, the case is brought to the Privy Council in London, which hears the case in 1926.
The following year, the report is approved and the last external border of Quebec is then established.
Quebec has never acquiesced in this judgment or ruled on the issue of this interprovincial boundary.
Aboriginal peoples in Quebec have expressed their feelings, feelings and aspirations through a multitude of art forms.
These artistic traditions are the most diverse and ancient found in Canada.
This wide variety includes woodcarving, porcupine pricking, skin painting and many more.
Aboriginal art is not only inspired by the tangible world, but also by the spiritual world.
Ces grands peuples avaient a particular concept of harmony that regulates the universe and those who failed to integrate.
When the native art was discovered by the Europeans, it caused a real stir.
These masterpieces were quickly admired for their audacity, ingenuity and the technical skill of Aboriginal artists.
It was around the 1920s that Native art flourished among the Americans.
Each indigenous people, from the prehistoric period, had their own form of art.
The Cree and Naskapi painted the skins they used for their blankets, bags, leggings, etc.
Animals being of fundamental importance, they respected the otter and the muskrat which were sacred to them.
Using their skin, the Ojibwe made medicine bags that were used to store tobacco.
These Algonquians adorned their bags with delicate repeated motifs, each with its distinct religious significance.
Inuit are an indigenous people in the far north of Quebec.
In Inuit beliefs, the animal is essential to life, so many works represent animals.
In religious rituals, the Inuit made masks that were decorated with engravings representing series of animals and natural phenomena.
Quebeckers today have a lot of eating habits that come from aboriginal people.
In the 1700s, Aboriginal people and Europeans did a lot of commercial and cultural exchanges.
They hunted more moose, caribou, deer, bear, goose and duck.
To meet their food needs, they also resorted to trapping.
The animals who are more aware of them are suffering from excessive muscle abuse, the beaver and le li√®vre.
These herbal teas were made of leaves, bark, stems and shrub fruits.
Today, we still eat a lot of these traditional herbal teas that Native people were preparing.
The Iroquois, unlike other peoples, eat much less meat than other peoples.
It was a metane that was prepared in the mixing of the meat and seafood with the graisse of ours.
He was also able to boil birch sap for syrup.
The cooking methods of foods vary greatly depending on the region and the foods available.
They showed them tomatoes, potatoes, squash, cucumbers and beans.
Europeans also showed some foods to Aboriginal people when they arrived in Canada.
This is a branch of the Linux kernel, modified for use on mobile devices.
Until version 4.4, Android has a virtual machine named Dalvik, which allows to run programs planned for the Java platform.
Indeed, the contemporary mobile devices of 2011 have the computing power of a personal computer ten years old.
Most, if not all, applications are run by the Dalvik VM.
The main difference is that the AWT and Swing GUI libraries are replaced by Android libraries.
These tools are made available as a plugin for the Eclipse development environment.
Android 3.0, intended for tablets, introduces the concept of "fragments": panels containing several visual elements.
A tablet - unlike a phone - usually enough space on the screen for several panels.
Starting in Release 5.0 released in 2014, the ART runtime (Android RunTime) replaces the Dalvik VM.
This more efficient runtime environment was developed by Google to mitigate the limited potential of Dalvik, created in 2007.

The gPhone was launched in October 2008 in the United States in an exclusive distribution partnership between Google and T-Mobile.
In the summer of 2015, Android has to deal with several crises.
Developed by a security researcher, it can disrupt 95% of devices running Google's OS with a simple MMS.
The hacker can have access to almost all data on the phone.
The second is a bug discovered by Trend Micro researchers that paralyzes phones and tablets.
In November 2016, Chinese spyware is discovered in Android smartphones.
It has installed natively by the Chinese company AdUps on 700 million Android devices to collect data from their users.
So, there should be a new version every year.
The delivery of a sculpture is the sign of the upcoming release of a new version.
This error raises rumors and the wrath of the community.
These 50 applications are for the most part calling for geolocation and social networking services.
When the user has to enter a text, Android displays at the bottom of the screen the "virtual keyboard" - a simulation of a computer keyboard.
Android can move all or part of the applications on an additional memory micro-SD type.
This possibility is based on the instruction coded in the application by its developer, which authorizes, privileges or forbids it.
This makes it possible to optimize the use of old or entry-level terminals with little internal memory.
It allows you to download software, books, movies or music, paid or not.
It is also possible to note them and to comment on them.
Applications are written in Java or C ++ and can be distributed other than through the Android Market.
This service is now closed since August 2011, but taken over in Beta by MIT.
Archos offers its independent Appslib service which also allows users to download and install applications on their tablets.
Samsung smartphones have them Galaxy Apps (formerly Samsung Apps).
Other small brands use their own store less provided failing to access the Play Store.
Android being a mainly open source system, alternative versions also called Custom ROMs (or "forks") have developed.
In fact, manufacturers update the system version 2 to 3 times during the life of the phone.
The alternative ROMs can therefore take advantage of the latest versions of Android and benefit from extensive support.
The main sites that can be accessed are usually developer forums grouping together several projects such as XDA developers
These ROMs often have a so-called participatory development where a team of independent developers creates their own system.
These alternative versions can even lead to the creation of a specially dedicated phone.
This is the case, for example, with OnePlus One from OnePlus, which has a version of the system developed by the CyanogenMod team.
The Android project defines compatible media as a medium capable of running any Android application.
To enable manufacturers to achieve this, the Android project achieves the "Compatibility Program".
Once Android is in control of the equipment, it is necessary to carry out any updates.
The HTC Magic arrived at the beginning of May 2009 at SFR, followed by the Samsung Galaxy (or i7500) at Bouygues.
The HTC Hero, available at the end of July 2009 without subscription, benefits from Sense, a particular skin (specific to HTC) of the interface.
It was indeed the first smartphone to benefit from Android 2.2 Froyo in June 2010.
It includes unlocking by facial recognition, the use of virtual buttons and an advanced voice recognition system.
On October 31, 2013, Google released the LG Nexus 5 with Android 4.4 (KitKat) and supporting the 4G.
In 2015, LG joins Google again by launching the Nexus 5X that replaces the Nexus 5.
The Nexus 6 will be replaced by the Nexus 6P manufactured by Huawei (Chinese manufacturer of smartphones).
These two smartphones are the first to have Android 6.0 alias "Marshmallow".
On October 4, 2016, Google announces two smartphones, Pixel and Pixel XL.
Android Nougat, they ship exclusively the "Pixel Launcher", the interface of Google, and virtual assistance 24/7.
It is developed by the Swedish company People of Lava and is called Scandinavia.
It has Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps and Twitter, has a web browser and an email client.
In the same vein, the Gen 8 Archos tablets (Gen 8) include Android 2.2 (FroYo).
Follows many Android tablets Honeycomb offered by several manufacturers, including Samsung, Acer, Asus, Toshiba and Sony.
It is available for sale on the Play Store since November 13, 2012.
However because of too much demand she finds herself out of stock very quickly.
DEA sells from September 2012, under the name of MyPlay, an Android-based video game console.
In the face of competition with Apple, Google has decided to iconize its OS by launching the Nexus One, manufactured by HTC.
These are smartphones that benefit from the latest versions of Google's OS and a pure interface with no overbuilder.
These are, among others, ZTE, Huawei, Acer, HTC, LG, Samsung, Archos, Sony, Dell, Motorola, Fujitsu, Sharp ...
It is an anti-theft and anti-loss service for remote control of mobile devices using the Android system.
The smartwatch or Android Wear works with any Android device regardless of the brand.
It should be noted that the company bought Sun, which had this patent less than a year before the announcement.
Various attempts at amicable agreement between the two companies have failed.
Also, the American justice has planned to hold a trial, which started in 2012.
His senior vice president believes that Android has reported more than a billion dollars in revenue at the end of 2010.
Beginning this year, this mechanism is expected to generate $ 40 million a year.
According to Millennial Media, Android generates more advertising revenue than iOS since October 2010.
For David Lawee, "the purchase of Android is Google's best deal."
It was during the Napoleonic wars that England began to speak of "allotments" or lands allotted to the workers.
But everyone agreed on the important role of gardens.
The private sector around the world also has an important role to play in sustainable development.
In France, rented or sold, the land attached the worker to his factory and kept him away from the cabaret.
If they had a paternalistic character, allotment gardens seduced because they corresponded to a real need.
In addition, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables for direct consumption is supposed to improve the food of the workers.
In homage to his father-in-law, he calls it "Schreberplatz" (literally: Schreber Square).
Soon the parents take possession of the space and begin to cultivate it.
These gardens are often collectively maintained by the workers, forming small communities that fuel the social bond.
Around this initiative, an organization was constituted in 1893, under the name of "work of the reconstitution of the family".
Five years later, this organization brings together 530 people from 125 families.
One of its particularities is that it is exclusively run by women.
In 1904, there are only 48 industrial gardens in the Paris region for 3.5 million inhabitants.
Through the Allotment Garden Society of Paris and the suburbs, their multiplication is favored.
The two world wars caused the setting in gardens of many parks and historical parcels.
The law of July 26, 1952 retains the expression "allotment gardens".
On October 15, 2003, a proposed law on collective gardens is considered by the Senate.
In contrast to Germany, allotment gardens in France retain the depreciated image of allotment gardens.
These settlements pose problems of access, security and are often without water networks and sometimes polluted.
Those who benefit from better locations are not immune to real estate transactions coveting their land.
Family garden plots are managed by private associations and assigned to individuals for their own production.
The demand being much higher than the offer, the time of obtaining a garden can reach several years.
This prize rewards a municipality that has achieved a remarkable policy of collective family gardens, flowered and accessible to the public.
During the Second World War, the owners of these gardens asked to direct themselves the associations concerning these gardens.
Until the 1950s, gardens were used primarily to produce vegetables.
It was founded in January 1990 and has participated in many Latvian governments since the independence of the country.
Compared to many emerging countries, the Chinese government is stable and encourages foreign investment.
In 1993, the Greens entered the Latvian government, with Indulis Emsis as Minister of the Environment.
In 2004, Indulis Emsis became Prime Minister of Latvia for a few months.
He is the first ecologist in the world to become head of a government.
(Ecologist Moana Carcasses Kalosil becomes prime minister of Vanuatu in 2013.)
In 2015, the Parliament elects the co-chairman of the party, Raimonds Vƒìjonis, President of the Republic of Latvia.
During the Second World War, he served in the Wehrmacht and was captured by the Americans in 1943.
He taught at the Free University of Berlin between 1950 and 1958 and at the University of Bonn from 1959.
Bracher is mainly concerned with the problems of the preservation and development of democracy.
He regards democracy as a frail institution and has argued that only concerned citizens can guarantee it.
His 1955 book "Die Aufl√∂sung der Weimarer Republik" ("The Disintegration of the Weimar Republic") is the best known.
Bracher advocates the idea that Nazi Germany was a totalitarian regime.
According to Bracher's opinion, Hitler was the "captain of the Third Reich".
Bracher is opposed to the use of the generic notion of fascism to explain the Nazi dictatorship.
Pro-American, he was one of the few German professors to fully support United States foreign policy during the Cold War.
Finally, US foreign policy has accelerated the relative decline of the United States vis-√†-vis others.
Serge Ankri (Hebrew ◊°◊®◊í'◊ê◊†◊ß◊®◊ô) is an Israeli actor born in Tunisia in 1949.
His family moved to the south of France in 1957.
He studied literature and theater at the University of Nice, and obtained a degree in literature.
Then, he works as a cameraman and director on Israeli television.
He teaches film at Tel Aviv University and Bet Zvi.
He directs the film department of the "Camera Obscura" art school from 1984 to 1990.
In 1993, he directed the regional cable channel Matav which is broadcast throughout the north of the country.
In the north of the country, a Syrian militia, led by Fawzi al-Kaoukji, attacked Jewish villages.
In 1993, he directed "Strangers in the night", an Israeli-French-American co-production with Anthony Delon and Charlotte V√©ry.
In 1994, he directed "Le Couscous de ma m√®re", a feature-length documentary presented at the Marseille Festival.
In 1995, he was appointed director of the "Documentary Film Fund".
He then returns to teaching in high schools and colleges of National Education.
In 2005, he directed "Question of Time", a feature-length documentary for the television channel Yes.
It welcomes students after the baccalaureate and delivers national diplomas up to grade MASTER II.
He is part of the network of art schools in France.
The school hosts approximately 300 students annually under the responsibility of a teaching team of 45 teachers.
The school successively carried the names of "free school of drawing of the city of Orleans", of "School of the fine arts" then of "Institute of visual arts".
The √âSAD is the heir to the former "Free School of Drawing of the City of Orleans", which has existed since 1787.
This autonomous status was necessary to fit into the European system.
The teaching at the √âSAD Orl√©ans finds its specificity in the articulation between sensitive training and anchoring in a social reality.
The creation is approached as a research that allows to emerge a personal approach where the artistic approach remains essential.
The tools of design and communication are therefore the subject of specific learning.
The fields taught are numerous (drawing, design, communication, illustration, graphic design, engraving, video, photography, model, multimedia ...)
Contacts are made with the professional world through internships, meetings and participation in competitions.
For many years, √âSAD Orl√©ans has forged links with international networks of art and design schools.
After the adoption of this system in the 1990s, many private schools were created.

All these territories are officially annexed to the kingdom after plebiscites.
It remains to successfully integrate different states that for centuries were separated.
In January 1861 the elections of the first unitary parliament take place.
In 1870, with the capture of Rome, Lazio was annexed to the kingdom, permanently removed from the Papal States.
Rome officially becomes the capital of Italy (as had previously been Turin and Florence).
After the fascist period and the Second World War, Istria with Fiume and Zara were sold in 1947 to Yugoslavia.
The basis of the new regime is extremely narrow and gives it great fragility.
The major problem of the new kingdom is the situation in the south of the peninsula (the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies).
Southern Italy is the domain of large latifundian property.
Rare assets in Italy are no longer invested in the south of the peninsula, which is abandoned to its situation.
The new state must also deal with a catastrophic financial situation.
The public debt soared from 420 million lire in 1850 to 725 million in 1858.
In 1866, the budget deficit is 721 million lire.
In addition to trade and budget deficits, there has now been a deficit of jobs.
It is therefore necessary to constantly resort to borrowing from foreign bankers (Rothschild, Barings, Hambros Bank ...).
Already in 1866, to avoid bankruptcy, the convertibility of gold notes is suspended.
The kingdom of Italy, heir to the kingdom of Sardinia, is born with a significant liability.
The decision of compulsory military service in 1872 will only aggravate the situation.
He moved away from France, the traditional ally who greatly helped Italy achieve unification.
For the Italian patriots the latter still holds territories that they consider as Italian, Trentino and Trieste (lands irredent).
The kingdom of Italy is a census democracy characterized by the weakness of the civic body, clientelism and coalition ministries.
The civic body is also reduced by the conditions of access to the right to vote.
The preconditions for the enjoyment of civil and political rights do not come into being in a day.
In 1882, the conditions are eased, the tax is lowered to 21 lire, the literate can register.
There are now 1 million voters and the influence of cities is increasing in political life.
Nevertheless, the abstention is particularly strong (65% of registered in Rome in 1913).

In 1870 Rome was conquered and became the capital of Italy the following year.
The government unilaterally regulates state-church relations by the law of guarantees.

With the economic crisis in Europe (1873), the misery of the day laborers increases which causes agricultural strikes.
The government is developing infrastructure and providing support to certain sectors.
Industrial production is increasing, but a favorable international situation, a national market and a suitable banking system are still lacking.
Above all, there is a strong collusion between economic power and political power.
But above all, there is no one in power who can change the country's economic policy.
But all power, whether political or economic, without a legitimate basis, is arbitrary.
They have no economic or political power in a society that gives them little value.
Some economists will say that the economy is an artificial process produced by the state economy and not private initiative.
France having removed it from the stranglehold on Tunisia (French protectorate in 1881), Italy conquered Eritrea between 1882 and 1885.
Francesco Crispi is the chef du gouvernement in 1887-1891 and 1893-1896.
Neapolitan lawyer, former Garibaldian, he is very authoritarian and wishes to restore to his country his past glory.

It symbolizes the arrival in power of men who did not participate in the Risorgimento.
He is the president of the Council of Ministers of fact, and often in title, between 1901 and 1914.
Giolitti practices corruption and electoral pressure to have a majority.
This Piedmontese is very moderate and a reformer to limit the progress of the Socialists.
To improve the situation of peasants it promotes the development of agricultural credit and rural banks.
Investments in agricultural and rural development are therefore crucial for food security and sustainable economic development.

There is a temporary emigration of a few years to Germany, Austria and France.
Every year, they send money back to their families back home, and then they come back.
Italians also migrate to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
On the eve of the First World War, Italy is a country whose economy is improving but remains fragile.
No single country, even the world's largest economy, can stop cooperation from other countries.

Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany led the country to enter the Second World War.
In 1943, the Allies landed in Sicily, marking the start of the Italian campaign.

The SB8R appears at the Milan motorcycle show in 1997.
The goal of this machine was to allow the Rimini factory to enter the World Superbike Championship.
It is a V-twin open at 90 ¬∞, four times with liquid cooling.
The rear part of the side members where the swingarm is anchored is made of carbon fiber.
This configuration increases stiffness and gain weight.
The flush angle is adjustable and can range from 22.9 to 23.9 ¬∞.
From the standard version, it adds an adjustable anodized aluminum crown and footrests.
The SB8R was available in red and white, enhanced with golden nets.
The first prototype, introduced in 1997, had a round double lens.
Nevertheless, the factory has considered but never realized, to produce a version, named SB8R Biposto, two-seater.
The SB8R is produced until 2000, the year of bankruptcy of the plant.
Bankruptcy occurs (when there is bankruptcy) under specific and identifiable reasons.
In order to engage the SB8 in the World Superbike Championship, Bimota released 150 copies of the SB8K.
She wears a white and orange dress embellished with golden threads.
These values ‚Äã‚Äãare achieved through the use of special camshafts and elements of the Suzuki Competition Kit.
The two air intakes on the fork head are replaced by a more discreet one.
If the Gobert version has a Pa√Øoli fork, the Santa Monica is equipped with an √ñhlins fork.

Nephew of General Robert Lee, he was a cavalry commander in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.
As the supreme commander of an army at war, Hollande has the leisure to redefine himself.

The wrestling style in Europe is mainly inspired by American and sometimes British wrestling.
Many countries have a wrestling scene developed or in the development phase.
Developed and developing countries must all invest in reducing emissions.
Developed and developing countries could benefit from greater coordination of economic policies.
Here is a list of the countries and their main federations and wrestlers (the list is to be completed).
In the 1970s, the, founded by Otto Wanz, proposed wrestling matches.
WWE also organized houseshows in Germany when they visited Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the 2000s, wrestling has taken off in Germany.
Today, the big names of the country are considered as small stars that are regularly found on the TV sets.
Germany does not have a particular style, we find all kinds of influences: American, Japanese, Mexican.
The "technical" style, however, remains a favorite, as in most European countries.
Salvatore Bellomo, a former wrestler at WWE and of Belgian origin, developed the first wrestling structures in Belgium.
The Belgian wrestling remains unpopular and promotions still very numerous attract only a very small public.
We can also consider wrestling in France as a special case.
Wrestling developed in France in the 1940s, with its own scene and its own stars.
Finally, it is the public that is best served, since it has the choice.
This is probably the country in Europe where wrestling is the best developed at the independent level.
The "English catch" base its system on sequences and small quick catch are favored.
It is also rare to see recurring finishes on the English scene.
Wrestlers often use particularly effective matches to finish matches, while others favor submission.
The broadcast was not done in order, and with a delay of about 4 months.
Once a year, the federation organizes a special show: "" Resliada "" where participate foreign wrestlers specially invited.
The IWF also has a professional wrestling school run by an instructor who has been trained in Canada.
Regional wrestling therefore remains an underground show but may meet with some success occasionally.
During the great years of French wrestling, many championships were organized in Switzerland.
The pile of the comb to passer may be added to a non-negotiable plutot produced.
Between 2000 and 2007, many promotions appeared: Ring of Europe, IWA-Switzerland, Swiss Wrestling Federation.
En 2008, la Ring of Europe devient la Swiss Championship Wrestling.
Adrian Johnatans, at the helm of the initiative, was trying to make catching known as best he could.
The public is much more numerous among the Alemannic than the Romans, and the scene takes a real form.
Each promotion is independent in its own region, but has votes for the overall decisions of the SPW.
In addition, many small businesses needed an inexpensive means of locomotion to grow.
On the other hand, the needs of growing medium-sized enterprises can not be met by microfinance institutions.
Finally, "keijid≈çsha" was a good way to help develop a Japanese car industry that was weak at the time.
In 2014, they still accounted for more than 30% of sales.
These small cars, which belong to the category of city cars in Europe, are not considered as such in Japan.
Most Japanese automakers produce "keijid≈çsha": Daihatsu, Honda, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Suzuki.
Until September 2011, Toyota was the only Japanese manufacturer not to offer in its range.
Since then, he has been broadcasting Pixis Space, which is a Daihatsu Move Conte rebadg√©e.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is the principal organization of the World Bank Group.
This year, the World Bank Group's support to developing countries will reach a new record.
The same is true for other international institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
Its original mission was to finance reconstruction after the Second World War.
Its headquarters were in Washington, and it contributed to the development of the United States as a world-economy.
Nowadays, she brings loans, mainly to states.
These loans are granted at very low interest rates or zero (equivalent to negative rates in present value).
Japan's weak growth and low interest rates over the last two decades are emblematic.
Low interest rates discouraged capital inflows and encouraged asset price inflation.
Of course, low long-term interest rates are needed for recovery.
The low level of real interest rates does not seem to be due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The electoral campaign of candidates therefore tends to avoid states where one candidate is sure to arrive in front of the other.
The swing states of Illinois and Texas determined the outcome of the 1960s.
Swing state status may change over time.
Groups for or against the euro have changed over time and differ from country to country.
In 2016, these two states are still considered "swing states".
And that's without counting the recourse to periphrases of the type:

There are 3, located in the cities of Abidjan, Bouak√© and Daloa.

In return, Venizelos managed to convince the military League to dissolve so as not to hinder the political game.
The sovereign summoned new elections in March 1910; three days later, the League announced its dissolution.
His partisans gave a brief introduction to Attique-B√©otie but he did not participate in the electoral campaign.
The officials became irremovable, and part of the recruiting was by competition.
The magistrates were protected by a Superior Council of the Judiciary.
The stabilization of the drachma allowed new loans abroad.
The navy was reorganized by a British mission led by Admiral Tufnell.
However, the military were excluded from the political life and the diadem Constantine and his brothers found their positions in the army.
She had an older sister, Annie (born in 1906), and two brothers, Dolf (1904) and Wim (1910).
When the young princess Juliana went to the city, Wim and Florrie were invited to play with her.
She undertook the study of biology at the University of Utrecht, showing a particular interest in ethology.
During the German invasion of the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, she was in Berlin.
On December 21, 1940, the day of the winter solstice, Heubel married Meinoud Rost van Tonningen.
She flees as soon as possible by Cuxhaven to Goslar in Germany, where her parents had a property.
Her husband was captured and imprisoned on May 8 by Canadian forces.
In 2000, during a TV show "Het zwarte schaap" (The Black Sheep), A.J.
After the death of her husband, Rost de Tonningen-Heubel remained active in several far-right movements.
Initially, she was placed under curatorship, like many former National Socialists.
His son Grimbert left his mother and went to live in the Fentener van Vlissingen family.
In 1952 she moved from The Hague to Villa Ben Trovato in Velp.
She brought the name of the villa "(T) rovato" closer to that of her husband "ROst VAn TOnningen", discovering a supernatural sign.
At that time, she had a private company in heating equipment.
At the same time, different private or semi-private entities have invested abroad.
Several times she was found guilty of distributing propaganda and organizing Nazi meetings.
From 1990, she had many contacts with the journalist Willem Oltmans.
The revelation to the general public of this fact in 1986 caused great emotion.
Nevertheless, this pension was maintained after a hearing in the lower house.
She defended herself so fiercely that the producer thought for a moment to give up the broadcast of the show.
Shortly after, considering that she could no longer live in the Netherlands, she went "into exile" in Belgium.
Florentine Van Tonningen-Heube died on March 24, 2007 at her home in Waasmunster, at age 92.
Residents in the area fear that the tomb will attract rallies or pilgrimages from right-wing extremists.
In times of crisis, cities are sometimes offered to people perceived as strong enough to save the state.
The same crisis is perceived as a solvency crisis for those who are geographically distant.
The communal institutions remain in place and often limit themselves to ratifying the decisions of the lords.
These, having governed for one or two generations, decide to legitimize their power and make it hereditary.
The attribution of these titles is the sign of the stabilization of seigneurial powers.
In those times, in northern Italy, the German emperors claimed feudal sovereignty.
The composition and the specific functions of the "signoria" vary from city to city.
Due to this disagreement of sovereignty, no border agreement has been signed between the two countries.
Countries that have signed such agreements have had to pay the price.
Its four lateral towers are considered the symbol of the city.
The hill where the castle of Bratislava will be built, overlooks the plain of Pannonia.
It has been inhabited for thousands of years, in particular because of its central and strategic position in Europe.
The place is also close to a ford to easily cross the Danube.
Other major discoveries date from the Hallstatt Civilization (Iron Age, 750-450 BC).
These early inhabitants founded an oppidum in which the current location of the castle was the main square.
Many objects (coins, tools ...) and foundations attest to this.
The situation changed with the arrival of the Slavs, considered as the direct ancestors of the Slovaks, in 500 in the region of Bratislava.
Initially, they partially used the ancient Roman and Celtic installations by adding fortifications.
The materials of the Roman constructions were used to build this Slavic castle.
Turmair mentions the names of Uratislaburgium / Wratisslaburgium, taken from the prince's name.
It is from the name of Predslav that the city and the castle took the Germanic name Pressburg.
Nevertheless, the exact location of the battle remains unknown and some place it west of Lake Balaton
Stephen III of Hungary escaped his enemies by taking refuge in the castle nearly 100 years later.
The construction was similar to that carried out in Germany under Frederick Barbarossa.
In 1182, Frederick Barbarossa gathered his Crusader army near the castle.
The castle was one of the few castles of the Kingdom of Hungary to resist the Mongol attacks in 1241 and 1242.
In addition, 7 square towers were built in the old city walls and a stone wall was erected around the castle.
As a result, he orders the Rozgonyis to upgrade the castle's fortifications to protect themselves from Hussite attacks.
In the years that followed, these improvements continued and the "residential" tower was destroyed.
The only current trace of the castle of this period is the Sigismund gate.
The castle becomes the headquarters of the diet and place of coronation.
As a result, the place became the most important place of Vienna.
For example, Gabriel Bethlen's troops occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621.
Imre Th√∂k√∂ly also tried it in 1682-1683 but did not manage to occupy the castle.
It is a stinging defeat for the Hungarians and Louis II dies drowned during his flight.
Immediately after her death, Queen Mary of Hungary fled Budapest with her retinue and moved to Bratislava.
She brings with her many objects (scepter, sword ...) which then constitute a treasure of great value.
The remains of the treasure were transferred to Vienna or recovered by Mary.
The shape of the castle was not changed except for the entrance.
Unfortunately, only part of the castle chapel has been preserved.
The works, which intensified in 1635 and ended in about 1647, were financed by Paul P√°lffy.
This transformation will give the castle a form very close to that currently known.
A year later, this title and function became hereditary for the P√°lffy family.
In 1653, it was the wooden ceiling's turn to be replaced.
Ten years later, the fortifications had to be reinforced to cope with the frequent attacks of the Ottoman Empire.
Josef Priami, the military engineer of the imperial court of Vienna, directed the work.
This decisive defeat of the Ottomans gradually put an end to the need to strengthen the fortifications.
The Vienna Gate was built in 1711 for the coronation of Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire.
She kept her promise by spending a lot of time in the castle, which she changed according to this new usage.
The bad news is that it will take much more time, effort and coordination globally.
Minor changes were made inside, a large garden added to the north.
Her husband Francis I of the Holy Empire, interested in botany, created a small garden east of the site.
These modifications were supervised by Johann Baptist Martinelli, the architect of the Viennese Imperial Court.
During this period, the castle was decorated for his son, Albert of Saxe-Teschen, appointed governor of Hungary 1765.
Albert was a keen art collector and he installed his works in his castle.
He left the castle in 1780 for Brussels, where he was appointed governor.
Part of his art collection was sent to his new home and to Vienna.
The entire collection was later repatriated to Vienna to become the Albertina gallery today.
In 1784, Joseph II installed at the castle a seminary for the training of Catholic priests.
This seminar played an important role in Slovak history, for having trained many intellectuals.
Anton Bernol√°k, the author of the first codification of the rules of standardization of the Slovak language, can be mentioned.
In 1802, the seminary is closed and the castle resumes military functions.
The interior rococo not being adapted, arrangements were made to accommodate 1500 soldiers.
The castle is the target of an attack by Napoleon's troops and is bombarded by their guns.
The castle is partially destroyed by flames that will also spread in parts of the city.
For more than a century, the castle remained abandoned and continuously deteriorated.
Parts of the castle were sold as building materials.
These projects were aborted and parts of the castle, preserved by the flames, were used as barracks until 1946.
From 1946, the castle, or rather its ruins, are open to the public.
In 1948, the city of Bratislava built an amphitheater north of the castle, which will be used for 15 years.
In the period 1953-1968 it was rebuilt in its original form before the fire.
Its reconstruction was initiated by the academic painter Janko Alexy, Professor Alfred Palffy and architect Mikul√°≈° Ba≈°o.
The castle is used for representations of the Slovak Republic.
It is also a museum and houses the collections of the Historical Institute of the Slovak National Museum.
In 2008, a last restoration of the castle was started, to end and June 2010.
A playground for younger visitors has been set up on the lower terrace to the east.
In the middle of the main courtyard, a statue of King Sv√§topluk has been erected.
Today, the castle is one of the main sights of Bratislava.
Harvey Rupert Elder aka The Mole Man ("Mole Man") is a character from the Marvel Comics universe.
He was the first enemy of the Fantastic Four and appeared in the first issue devoted to these new superheroes.

Thus, he decides to destroy all power plants in order to weaken the world population.
His hopes of conquest are halted by the intervention of the Fantastic Four who have just obtained their powers.
A new attempt, during which he tries to sink entire cities, is not more successful.
The results of ongoing clinical trials and new studies will be needed to fill these gaps.

He must also defend himself against Terminus who tries to absorb his loyal Moloids.
The municipal district of Motheo covers the center of the state-free, including the regional capital, Bloemfontein.
This district is the political, economic and industrial heart of the province.
When the economic structure changes, economic policy must also change, otherwise development may be hampered.
It was at the heart of French economic policy in the aftermath of the Second World War.
In 149-148, the city, despite its isolation, withstands the military pressure of Rome and even knows some tactical success.
In 147-146, thanks to the arrival of a new Roman leader, Carthage is methodically invested.
Assaulted, the Punic capital is sacked and destroyed.
The victory against Carthage gives Rome a new province: Africa.
Carthage remains in ruins more than a century before being reborn under the Empire.
It can align tens of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of warships.
However, when news of the Roman mobilization comes, it is panic.
The city is perfectly aware that the power of Rome, on land as on sea is now much higher.
Whatever the prosperity of the city, Rome has more money, more men and more boats than its rival.
Almost at the same time, she intervenes on the other side of the Mediterranean in a fourth war against Macedonia.
When the fleet is ready, they finally choose to embark and carry the war to Africa.
A new embassy goes directly to the two consuls who present a second requirement: the delivery of weapons.
They get immediate satisfaction, and a long line of wagons connects Carthage to Utica.
Carthage is completely disarmed and no longer threatens Rome.
In a great speech, Censorinus first recalls the "wrongs" of Carthage, then he gives a moral lesson.
Proponents of submission and Italians present suffer the same fate.
The Senate of Carthage has no choice: in turn, it declares war on Rome.
Carthage must urgently rearm and reorganize to resist.
The war party, now in command, is making aggressive decisions.
He even requisitioned slaves, proof that the situation seems hopeless: in fact, we normally do not mobilize them.
Pregnant who will become, in the words of Serge Lancel, "the true hero of this long seat".
The consuls, who understand that the affair will last, each establish their camp.
From there he harasses the communications and the rear of the Romans.
Dans la ville, an excellent genre of cavalry, Hamilcar (or Himilcon) Pham√©as, rejoined for the effectuer's mission from the outings against the beleaguered.
Several groups of legionaries are surprised and massacred in various ambushes.
With summer, swamps of the isthmus become putrid and many men are affected by fevers.
"A popular tradition is that the sick, before dying, enjoy a temporary recovery.
For Carthage, this improvement corresponds to the year 148 "notes the historian Yann Le Bohec.
Massinissa, however, made the Romans his executors in the person of Scipio Emiliano.
The new kings observe a cautious wait-and-see, probably for the same reasons that inspired their late father.
After the assassination of Hasdrubal grandson of Massinissa, Hasdrubal Bo√©tharque comes to assume the supreme command in the besieged city.
In this one, not only the situation improves, but that of the Romans deteriorates.
An improvement of a few months which stops abruptly in 147 with the arrival of a new leader: Scipion √âmilien.
In Rome, his prestige grew with the plebs as the siege dragged on.
He was also a good negotiator, which explains why Massinissa made him his executor.
When he got in touch with Pham√©as, he literally managed to turn it over.
For Carthage, it was a very rough blow that showed the precariousness of its recovery.
But Scipion is very popular and it's also an excellent policy.
In addition to his military qualities, he is considered to be temperate, generous and sincerely pious.
In the spring of the year 147, Scipio Emilian returns under the walls of the besieged city.
In many ways, the seat is to start again, if not to start.
In the emergency, we must remobilize men whose morale and discipline have changed dramatically after months of failure.
Joining the act to the word, he immediately reinstated a military operation badly engaged by a legate named Mancinus.
The company fails to turn disaster and the situation is just restored by the intervention of Scipio Emilien.
Having saved his legate, Scipion then tries a maneuver similar to the one he has just missed.
He organizes a landing, probably at Jebel Khaoui, which is quite far from the heart of the city.
It is necessary to isolate completely the city which for almost two years has never ceased to be supplied from its hinterland.
During the two previous Punic wars, the consuls had already led gigantic and endless seats.
An old Roman precept even states that a war is gained more with the pickaxe than with the sword.
Famine is emerging and strikes civilians first, with serious political consequences.
The consequences for the political economy of the region are serious.
He has the Roman prisoners conquered at the top of the ramparts, under the eyes of their helpless compatriots.
This war that they never had the means to earn now becomes "inexpiable".
With the energy of despair, the Carthaginians are trying to break the blockade.
With what remains of wood in the city, a fleet is built in record time.
For the Romans, many of whom were landed to participate in the siege, the surprise is complete.
They were totally unaware of the secretly constructed port of war, probably shortly before the conflict.
But the Carthaginians, because of the inadequacies of their admiral, fail to exploit the effect of surprise.
Even caught off guard, the Romans retain their naval superiority acquired during the first Punic War.
"The empire of the sea" of Carthage was only a distant memory.
Scipion has identified the new exit by its fleet and focuses its efforts on the ports area.
From there, he installs war machines to start destroying the sea wall.
With great courage, the Punic soldiers launch a real suicide counter-attack.
Indifferent to the blows that are carried to them, they reach the swimming platform and manage to burn the rams.
The Romans, however, remain on the position, even if the assault attempts cease for a time.
Before resuming the offensive against the city, Scipion Emilien wants to liquidate everything that still poses a problem on his back.
He begins by defeating a reinforcement troop arrived from Mauritania.
It is thus Scipio who takes the initiative and succeeds in annihilating the army of Nepheris, constrained to the capitulation.
This series of strategic successes achieved in the winter of 147-146 ends up removing any hope of relief to the Carthaginians.
The situation in the city is such that a series of defections strikes the highest level of the state.
After the departure of Pham√©as, it is the turn of Hasdrubal the Bo√©tharque to seek a way out.
Seeing that the situation of his people is hopeless, he thinks of negotiating, but only for his own account.
He accepts the mission, which proves in passing that carriers of bold despatch could still cross the Roman lines.
But the outcome of the conflict is hardly any doubt for the besiegers.
Scipio thus confines himself to promising life saved and the free disposal of only a part of the property.
In spring 146, the Carthaginians, pressed by hunger and fatigue resist more and more difficult.
Scipio promises them a warm welcome to his homeland, a temple, sacrifices.
The city is now ready to be delivered without restraint to the iron and fire of the legions.
It is given from the quay conquered in front of the commercial port the previous year.
In an attempt to slow their advance, Hasdrubal set the commercial port on fire.
Pushing back their enemies exhausted by hunger, the Romans also seized the port of war and debouch on the lower town.
From there, they reach the main square of the city, the agora.
Ancient authors have very rarely described this type of commitment, which, even today, is extremely difficult and deadly.
The Romans must progress from the agora to the foot of Byrsa Hill.
Three wide avenues, lined with six-storey buildings, open in front of them.
Legionaries advance through alleys and go from one terrace to another using beams and planks.
At the sound of the trumpets, the cohorts take turns to leave no respite to the defenders.
Terraces, we launch on the assailants all kinds of projectiles.
no-valid-translation
In the streets, the progression is hampered by the mass of the dead and wounded.
The low city destroyed by the flames, the genius traces a single avenue through the rubble.
Byrsa Hill is surrounded by a rampart, making it a great citadel.
Anyway, the Romans methodically undermine the wall and begin the investment of the place.
In addition to the last defenders under the orders of Hasdrubal the Bo√©tharque, there have taken refuge the Roman or Italian defectors.
It is then that Hasdrubal abandons the last square of the defenders and passes to the Romans on the only promise to have life saved.
The fight being a moment suspended, his wife then asks to speak.
A messenger is going to bring the news to Rome, who is organizing a big party.
The fire that was lit to facilitate the assault does not end until the tenth day.
Ancient writers insist on the complete, systematic and organized destruction of the city.
Archaeological excavations confirm the facts, despite some expert debates on the details.
Salt watering - besides its exorbitant cost - does not belong to the traditions of the Roman religion.
They are thus dispersed to Rome, Italy, Sicily and the rest of Africa.
They will be lost little by little, to the great disappointment of historians.
As the law of war demands, soldiers are rewarded with the plunder of all that can be.
Empires are not eternal, regardless of their glory and power.
In reality, it is only an internal autonomy for the price of their rallying.
It becomes officially "ager publicus", that is to say collective property of the Roman people, taken of war.
Historians still discuss the behavior of Rome during these three years.
The historian Ben Kiernan sees for it the "first genocide" in history.
Erik Christiansen thinks it's impossible to say why the last clash broke out ...
Seventy years earlier, with Hannibal, Rome had almost been defeated.
The Punic culture, however, remains for a long time with its language and its gods some of which mingle with the Roman deities.
This is the case for example of Saturn-Baal Hammon which is still figured during the Christian period.
Time-sharing and reduction of working hours correspond to related concepts but are significantly different.
The counterparts obtained by the companies, the increased flexibility of the work and the wage moderation, dissatisfied a part of the wage-earning.
So the reduction in working time has been a massive job creator (almost 200,000 jobs created in mid-2000).
At the same time, existing and newly created jobs are far from offering rising wages.
In Germany, the state seeks to promote tripartite negotiations through the Employment Alliances.
The goal is to save as many jobs as possible among the 3,000 threatened.
The reduction of working time is therefore here at the service of work sharing.
In Denmark, the state intervened in 1998 to increase the legal number of days off.
In Belgium, the statutory working week was reduced to 38 hours per week in 2003.
In 1928, a $ 6 million envelope was voted and the park system began to expand.
The organization currently manages coastal areas composed of estuaries, beaches, dunes and forest parks.
Areas are totally protected and others serve as relaxation spots for visitors.
The organization also has museums, classified housing, lighthouses, ghost towns, etc.
The parks aim to preserve the flora and fauna as well as the cultural heritage of the region.
But a cultural heritage should not be preserved everywhere and not at any price.
In the end, power remained in the hands of the king, at least during his lifetime.
In the end, the ruling elite is torn apart because they have no one else to face.
He bears towards his regents, very marked marks of mistrust.
This text shows a renewal of royalty by its originality.
Indeed, the ordinance of 1190 is the first real royal ordinance issued by a French monarch.
Philip Augustus then instituted a kind of administrative royalty: the royal office served the public utility.
It was from the summer of 1190 that Philippe Auguste and Richard Coeur de Lion left for the crusade.
The King of France participates in the siege of Acre but the Crusaders must surrender in July 1191.
On the way back, Philip Augustus goes through Rome where the Pope authorizes him to leave the crusade.
The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as well as many French lords take the road towards Jerusalem.
Philippe Auguste (1165-1223) then decided to leave, accompanied by Richard the Lionheart, in 1190.
Philip II, said Philip Augustus, is the seventh king of France of the Capetian dynasty.
Philippe then organizes sumptuous funerals, but this death reminds him of the fragility of every human being.
The arrangements made by Philip for the administration and the government of the kingdom have been called wills.
Rather, it is an order or a testamentary ordinance rather than a mere testament of last wish or legation of property.
It sets a power for bailiffs, bailiffs and industrial tribunals in the management of justice cases.
And sets up a new administrative system for the questions of the royal churches.
The judicial question, and in particular that of the bailiffs and provosts, is dealt with from the beginning of the text.
With this order, Philippe Auguste organizes the administration of justice exercised until then by the stationary provost.
The bailiffs replace the provost as agents of local justice.
The provosts, meanwhile, are tacitly admitted in the order, and keep their financial functions.
They appear as officers of justice for whom the surveillance of provosts is only a task like the others.
The bailiffs, as active agents, are virtually unknown to the Capetian charters before the reign of Philip Augustus.
Before 1190, he associated more and more the bailiffs with the provosts as recipients of the royal orders.
After the return of the king in 1191, the royal instructions are more and more often addressed to the only bailiffs.
If they also concern provosts, they are almost always appointed second.
Philippe Auguste specifies besides: "And in our lands properly designated for this purpose we institute our bailiffs".
This certainly means that jurisdiction is defined by the name of the bailiff and not by the territory.
no-valid-translation
The intention of Philippe Auguste, in matters of justice, is to extend the wheels by which the royal court resolves disputes.
The forfeitures that belong to us will be registered "".
The Assizes are one of the judicial innovations of 1190 that will become a permanent fixture of royal justice.
The bailiffs then report on the affairs of the kingdom and the conduct of the provosts.
If complaints are raised against the bailiffs, they are presented to the regents during these sessions.
Thanks to the information gathered three times a year, the regents keep the king informed of the state of the kingdom.
Periodic sessions of the "curia regis" will no longer take place at the return of the king.
The other two would be Nicolas Baucel and Baudouin Bruneau, but these are just suppositions.
These six men therefore have similar roles to provincial labor courts, but they also have financial roles.
The judicial organization thus takes an important place in the order of 1190 of Philippe Auguste.
We are seeing major changes in the management and administration of justice.
The bailiffs take the ascendancy on provos, sits are put in place, the "curia regis" is reformed.
In addition, the regents then have a mandatory role of justice.
In this ordinance, the social relations between religious power and royal power are in favor of the ecclesiastics.
This ordinance then prescribed to the regents the procedures that Philippe Auguste followed in the matter.
Once the bishop elected and duly consecrated by the ecclesiastical authority, it is restored, again, without opposition.
It is the first time that a French king publishes in their main features the rules governing the elections.
But these procedures, in fact, were a common practice since the beginning of the Capetian era.
For this, the regents must appeal to the advice of Brother Bernard.
Bernard was prior of Grandmont before managing a community of hermits in Vincennes.
But the regal may be open to some abuses for a long time practiced by the Capetians.
It is to avoid these abuses on the part of the regents that Philippe Auguste submits them to the advice of Bernard de Vincennes.
In 1185, Henry II and Philip Augustus raise extraordinary taxes when they prepare for the Third Crusade.
The valuation method and the rates used differ, but the basis of this tax, movable property, remains the same.
The clergy protested that the poor and the weak had never been so oppressed by this "odious tithe".
This rule is therefore a continuity of waiver of aid for the crusade.
Philippe Auguste seems to have preferred earth reliefs and silver aids.
It is assumed that Philip demanded this service during the wars of the first decade.
In the last three lines of the text, Philippe Auguste explains that the royal revenues must be transported to the Temple.
The choice of a cross order as depositary of the Royal Treasury was certainly intended to facilitate the preparations for the crusade.
It is not known whether Louis VII left the Royal Treasury at the Temple after his return from crusade.
It is also said that Adam, a royal cleric, canon of Noyon, is instructed to have to record the accounts thus rendered.
Each of them owns the keys of the chests where the money is stored, plus a key to the Temple.
In particular, he is responsible for complex analyzes of bureaucracy, the advent of capitalism and the process of rationalization in the West.
In addition to his research work, Weber has engaged in political action.
In particular, he was invited to contribute to the drafting of the Constitution of the Weimar Republic in 1919.
Max Weber is considered the founder of comprehensive sociology.
Comprehensive sociology is a sociological approach that makes the subjective meaning of the actors' behaviors the foundation of social action.
"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" is a classic of sociology, over which it has had considerable influence.
This process is particularly marked by the birth and deployment of capitalism and bureaucracy.
The reception of Max Weber's work has only been progressive, particularly in France.
In this editorial activity, we can see the ever-increasing importance and timelessness of a leading sociological thought.
Contemporary philosophy, especially the Frankfurt School, has been marked by its characterization of modernity as a rationalization of life.
By the works of Catherine Colliot-Th√©l√®ne, Weber's readings are no longer perceived as anti-Marx.
Chapter 2 of this book takes stock of "Max Weber and Marxism".
We already find in Bourdieu this idea that Weber can be read as an extension of Marx.
Max Weber owes the highlighting of bureaucracy as a form of social organization.
Karl Emil "Maximilian" Weber, eldest of eight children, born into a Protestant bourgeois family.
One of his younger brothers, Alfred, will also become a prominent sociologist.
His father (also "Max"), initially high official, will be elected deputy of the Liberal-national party in the Reichstag after the German unification.
His mother (H√©l√®ne, n√©e Fallenstein), of Huguenot origin by his maternal family (the Souchay), was a cultured and deeply believing woman.
After obtaining his "Abitur" (equivalent of the baccalaureate), he enrolled in law at the faculty of Heidelberg.
In addition to law school, he attended courses in political economy, philosophy, history and theology.
In 1883, at the age of 19, Max Weber left for Strasbourg to do his military service.
Unlike the latter, H. Baumgarten was a liberal hostile to compromise with Bismark's policy.
In 1884, he resumed his studies in Berlin, under pressure from his family who wished to separate him from the Baumgarten.
Become a hard worker, Weber specializes in the history of law, while pursuing a course leading to a career as a lawyer.
He married that same year with a relative of his mother, Marianne Schnitger.
Their marriage was built on a constant intellectual complicity, but the couple remained childless.
In 1894, Max Weber was appointed to a chair of political economy at the University of Friborg.
In May 1895 he delivered his inaugural lecture, "The National State and Economic Policy", which caused a sensation.
First, Iran's national economic and political conditions have changed significantly since the last round of talks.
Max Weber has not stopped supporting the power politics of reunified Germany.
It will change however, during his public life, often of political position.
He put the greatness of the nation and the power of the state above all.
Weber then goes to rest on Lake Geneva on the advice of his doctor.
He resumed his classes a year later but relapsed in 1899.
He leaves then a second time on a trip: he visits Corsica, Italy and Switzerland.
Faced with his nervous fragility, Weber, helped by an inheritance, gives up teaching.
He will not return to teaching until more than 10 years later, after the war.
When the First World War broke out, Weber, who was 50, asked to be recalled as a reserve officer.
He will then manage, but only for a short time, the management of eight hospitals in the Heidelberg region.
It was indeed during the war that Weber began writing his vast project of comparative sociology of world religions.
He also participated in the commission charged with drafting the new Reich Constitution.
In the midst of the revolutionary agitation of 1918, Max Weber will be one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party.
In 1918, he left for Vienna where a temporary post of teaching economics awaits him.

Max Weber died suddenly in 1920, at the age of 56, due to poor pneumonia.
Max Weber's epistemology (ie, thinking about science) is extremely sophisticated and complex.
Only a few of its elements will be reported here.
Weber is an important representative of the German dualistic and anti-positivist tradition from which German sociology was constructed.
For Weber, these sciences are too far removed from the natural sciences for them to be inspired by their methods.
On the other hand, political economy is characterized by a methodology inspired by the natural sciences.
A general rule in political science is that a faltering economy causes greater mistrust in institutions.
Axiological neutrality poses a certain number of epistemological problems, on which Max Weber has given a decisive reflection.
How, then, can they escape normative assessments, based on values, on their objects, and claiming objectivity?
To overcome this problem, Weber distinguishes between "value judgments" and "value relationships".
Weber, posing the understanding against the explanation, which prevails in the hard sciences, questions the relations of causality.
The sociologist must therefore try to isolate a certain number of causes, but these do not come under simple causality.
That is to say, it is more a question of conditioning than of causality in the usual sense.
The book in which his conception of causality is most sensitive is "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism".
This is the definition of sociology that Weber proposes in the first pages of 'Economy and Society'.
For Weber, the social world is thus constituted by the aggregation of the actions produced by all the agents that compose it.
The basic unit of sociology is therefore the social action of an agent.
Analyzing the social is therefore starting from these actions and the intentions that constitute them.
Thus, for Weber, the accidental collision of two cyclists is not a social action.
The second part of Weber's definition of sociology is often put aside.
It is essential, however, and is the specificity of Weberian sociology.
But for Weber, these consequences are most often unwanted, not consistent with the intentions of the actor.
Weber, in his analysis of the motives for action, proposes his famous typology of determinants of action.
The "emotional" action is the type of act committed under the influence of an emotion, like a slap given under the influence of anger.
Action "rational in value" corresponds to the actions by which an actor seeks to achieve a value.
The judgment of the observer is irrelevant for judging the rationality of the action.
Weber attaches great importance to the process of rationalization of the world.
However, it seems to him that this process has had a specific direction in the West.
The world thus comes to be considered meaningless, being a pure physical mechanism without intention.
A collection of texts on this theme, "Sociology of Religions", was published by Gallimard in 1996.
His goal was to find an explanation for the different evolutions of Western and Eastern cultures.
Aplysia fasciata, the black sea hare, is a large, naked-bodied gastropod mollusc species.
Two little undeveloped eyes are visible almost below the rhinophores.
In metropolitan France, this species can be found on all coasts (Atlantic and Mediterranean, including Corsica).
The animal is more active at night, much of the day being spent resting (sometimes buried in the sand).
The success of Morales is largely based on a paradox.
The parliamentary model based on two major parties appeared in the 19th century in Great Britain.
Experimental ablation of the rhinophore does not suppress foraging, but greatly decreases the time spent on sexual activities.
Swimming: the animal swims in open water only if the body of water is calm.
The exact manner in which the displacement and effected is still imperfectly understood.
A videoinformatic analysis of the swimming movements shows that different regions of the parapodia are then animated by cyclical movements.
According to the available data, the swimming speed and the oscillation period also depend on the temperature of the water.
This hormone is emitted by the genital tract and present in the egg cord.
They lay long cylindrical and thickening threads forming a long sequence of thousands of tiny egg packets.
They visually evoke by far a pack of spagetti, usually glued to a hard substrate.
Spawning behavior and egg masses were observed in the areas usually not frequented by these animals.
The time spent mating increases with the number of partners present.
In the plankton stage, large numbers of larvae are eaten by many predators.
These defensive molecules are lactones and their chemical structures were described in 1992).
Although provided with means of effective defenses (toxins, ink and opaline), if it is handled with precaution, it turns out to be harmless.
However, since the use of credit cards, their use is much less widespread than before.
At the end of 2012, American Express decided to stop the sale of travelers checks in several countries, particularly in France.
Some banks like Travelex have chosen to sell "cash travelers", Cash Passport, which work like credit cards.
Banks and credit card companies are more reluctant to renew credit.
The amounts often have a value representing 20, 50 or 100 units of the chosen currency.
When there is a commission, it rarely exceeds 1% of the total value of the checks.
Thus, American Express, the historic market leader, has not issued more in France since May 2013.

Bachelor's degree in law, former Brazzaville University College of Education (CESB), 1969.
Forest groups of hunter-gatherers are identified differently according to the regions in which they live.
The cultures and languages ‚Äã‚Äãof nomadic groups and subgroups show significant variations across the island.
Several terms have been and are still used by farmer groups in different regions to designate their nomads.
The few classification attempts made, especially for Sarawak groups, are not generalizable to the whole island.
Our ethnic, cultural and linguistic knowledge of Borneo's nomads is limited by few historical and ethnographic sources.
Colonial literature on Kalimantan and Sarawak is abundant, but there is little mention of Borneo nomads.
The earliest sources point to the existence of nomads - sometimes described with a tail - in the interior of the island.
These references are often short notes based on indirect information.
The publication of substantial information succeeds them, curiously most of them concern Kalimantan first.
A generation of social scientists working on the Borneo nomads are gradually forming.
Other works are published in the 1970s, both in Sarawak and in Kalimantan province.
From the 1980s on, theses devoted to the nomads of Kalimantan, as well as several notable works are the subject of publications.
In the mid-1990s, new researchers completed the existing ethnography.
Several research programs on nomadic groups in Borneo have been launched in recent years.
Research in recent years has shown how important and important the concept of equity is.
The majority is about local ecological knowledge and the management of natural resources.
These programs currently cover two regions, Betung Kerihun National Park and Malinau District in East Kalimantan.
According to the custom of the time in France, his family name was spelled in French Ignatieff.
Pavel Nikolayevich Ignatiev was Minister of Education from 9 January 1915 to 27 December 1916.

During this meeting, he described the direction of the new school policy that he intended to apply.
It was recognized as necessary to ensure continuity of the secondary school curriculum and subsequent phases of training.
A very important component of the educational reform project was the democratization of national education in Russia.
It was also proposed to create a high school committee made up of members of the society.
The educational councils of the schools obtained the right to independently develop curricula and programs to solve economic problems.
These problems can only be solved by sustainable economic development.
As a result, on January 1, 1917, Count Ignatiev received the honorary title of cavalry master of the court.
On January 9, 1917, Nicholas II of Russia dismissed him.
After the events of February 1917, the Interim Government's Inquiry Commission subjected Count Ignatiev to an interrogation.

The goal of a world without nuclear weapons is of utmost importance for the common good.
He participates in the hom√©ostasis of sodium, potassium and water in salts of renal excretion, and has a vasodilator action.
In humans, its gene, called "ANP", is located on chromosome1.
The FNA receptor is a guanylate cyclase receptor which makes it possible to produce cGMP from GTP.
The main effect of ANF is to lower blood pressure by several mechanisms:
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is thus inhibited in its vasoconstrictor function in particular.
The resistance in the vessels is lower, the blood pressure drops.
It has a myorelaxant action on the vascular smooth muscle cells, and thus induces a vasodilatation of the vessels.
The radius of the vessels increases, the resistance decreases and the blood pressure drops.
Health spending will increase, putting more pressure on budgets.
The baby hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) is a hippopotamus species native to the forests and swamps of West Africa.
Mating and farrowing can occur in water or on land.
They are threatened mainly by the loss of their habitat, as forests are deforested and converted to agricultural land.
They are also threatened by poaching, hunting, natural predators and war.
Dwarf hippopotamuses have roughly the same general shape as common hippos.
They have a hippopotamoid skeleton, with four short legs and four fingers on each foot, supporting a heavy body.
It is very similar to that of the common hippopotamus with a thin epidermis surmounting a dermis several centimeters thick.
This alkaline substance would have antiseptic properties and would also play the role of sunscreen.
The skeleton of the dwarf hippopotamus is slenderer than that of the common hippopotamus with proportionately thinner bones.
Proportionately, the dwarf hippopotamuses have longer legs and neck, smaller heads than their cousins.
The behavior of the dwarf hippopotamus differs from that of the common hippopotamus in many ways.
It is much closer to that of tapir due to the evolutionary convergence between these two species.
Dwarf hippopotamuses tend to ignore each other rather than confront one another in the event of a meeting.
Like the common hippopotamus, the baby hippopotamus comes out of the water at dusk to feed.
It circulates on pre-existing trails to travel in the dense forest.
He marks his passage by projecting his faeces by an energetic agitation of the tail while defecating.
He spends about six hours a day looking for food.
Most of their diet consists of ferns, large dicotyledon leaves and fallen fruit.
Their diet is of better quality than that of the common hippopotamus.
No study of behavior during the breeding season was conducted in the wild.
Sexual maturity for the dwarf hippopotamus occurs between three and five years.
The dwarf hippopotamuses remain together during the mating period but the duration of the relationship is not known.
In captivity, the small hippopotamus dwarves were designed and are born throughout the year.
Young dwarf hippopotamuses can swim almost immediately after birth.
The mother returns about three times a day to the place where the young are hidden to nurse them.
The largest population of Liberian Dwarf hippopotamuses is found in Sapo National Park.
It is in the Southern Ocean that the largest population of krill is found.
Studies of these populations, however, have been complicated by civil wars in this country.
In C√¥te d'Ivoire, the dwarf hippopotamus lives in several forest areas, particularly in the Tai National Park.
In Guinea, dwarf hippopotamuses live in the Ziama Reserve on the border with Liberia.
The smallest population is Sierra Leone, estimated in 1993 at about 100 individuals.
According to MSW there are two subspecies, the second being extinct:
The Nigerian Dwarf hippopotamus (called "C. liberiensis heslopi") has never been studied in the wild and has never been captured.
He estimated that there were probably no more than thirty dwarf hippopotamuses in the area at the time.
Heslop reportedly sent four dwarf hippopotamus skulls to the London Museum of Natural History.
These specimens had not been subjected to taxonomic evaluation until 1969, when G.B.
Nigerian Dwarf hippopotamuses were seen or slaughtered in Rivers, Imo and Bayelsa states in Nigeria.
The biggest threat to dwarf hippos in the wild is the loss of their habitat.
The number of hippopotamuses killed in this way is not known, however.
Although threatened in the wild, hippopotamuses breed easily in zoos.
Between 1970 and 1991, the population of hippopotamuses born in captivity more than doubled.
In captivity, the dwarf hippopotamus lives from 30 to 55 years, more than in nature.
Since 1919, only 41 percent of the dwarf hippopotamuses born in zoos were males.
In Liberia the animal was traditionally known as "water cow".
Early reports described the animal as a kind of wild pig.
Several skulls were sent to the American naturalist, Samuel G. Morton, while residing in Monrovia, Liberia.
Johann B√ºttikofer and were sent to the Museum of Natural History in Leiden, the Netherlands.
The first dwarf hippopotamuses introduced to Europe and surviving were in 1911.
He offered it at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington.
Villagers believed that baby hippo babies were not their mother but licked the secretions of her skin.
Under the control of the Ministry of Defense, it is under the direct command of the President of Brazil.

In fact, war often represents the failure of politics, of political imagination.
It is repealed and replaced by the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD 2), adopted on 25 November 2015.
The directive aims to ensure fair and open access to payment markets and to strengthen consumer protection.
This prevents payment service providers from offering competitive services throughout the EU.
This directive has important advantages for all users of payment services.
This approach has a significant advantage: it does not require redenomination of bank assets and liabilities.
It provides a legal basis for launching cross-border automatic debit payment systems.
Yet modern transponders and automatic payment systems have erased the issue.
The purpose of the Directive is to provide the legal basis for the creation of a single euro payment area.
This implies the removal of all technical, legal and commercial barriers between national payment markets.

Hurricane Kyle is the eleventh tropical storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2008 hurricane season in the North Atlantic Ocean.
It comes from a tropical disturbance that passed in the northern part of the West Indies during the third week of September.
On September 24, the wave began to move north and became a tropical storm.
"Kyle" gave torrential rains over Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, before even becoming a tropical storm, causing four deaths.
A tropical wave from the West African coast crossed the Atlantic.
On the morning of September 28, Kyle had a more disorganized look.
The center of the upper part of the colder clouds was north-east of the central surface.
Flood warnings were issued in Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands.
In the Dominican Republic, a green alert was issued for some areas on the 22nd.
On the 23rd, the authorities switched to the yellow alert for eight provinces and the red alert for eight others.
The evacuation was ordered for the vulnerable areas of San Pedro de Macoris, La Romana, Barahona and San Jose de Ocoa.
Early on September 26, tropical storm Kyle approaching Bermuda, local authorities issued storm watches.
The warnings were lifted on September 27 at 17h local.
With locally over 760 millimeters of accumulation, the rivers overflowed and flooded the lower areas.
The Dominican Republic also had heavy rains while Haiti was largely spared.
Household savings are only part of a country's net savings.
No damage or death has been reported in these two countries.
On September 28th at 9:00 pm local time (00:00 GMT on the 29th), Kyle made landfall just north of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.
He barely reached category 1 of the Saffir-Simpson Ladder.

Indeed, there are some products that the private sector is simply unable to provide.
For some, this controversy is a spiritual one and the Dalai Lama's disapproval a simple recommendation.
Thus, for historian Patrick French, the Dalai Lama warned against the worship of Dorje Shugden.
Immediately, the Tibetan government in exile promulgated its opinion transforming it into a total ban.
Continuing, Helmut Gassner talks about the unexpected reaction of practitioners of the Dorje Shugden worship:
The latter then wrote an open letter to the Dalai Lama, which remained unanswered.
According to historian Patrick French, the Dalai Lama warned against the worship of Dorje Shugden.
In January 2012, the Shugden movement was called an anti-Dalai Lama group by the Indian secret services.
"People& Power- The Dalai Lama: The devil within", Aljazeera):
The Al Jazeera TV channel sent journalists to India to investigate the ban and persecution.
On March 21, 2014, the Tibetan Parliament in Exile proclaimed a resolution against the community of Shugden practitioners.
In the Mahayana Preservation Foundation (FPMT) manual, Lama Zopa Rinpoche says:
On the IMI / FPMT website, students considering ordination should "NOT be Shugden practitioners."
Lama Zopa says this while talking about himself and his teacher Lama Yeshe, the founder of the FPMT:
After two postponements, the trial was scheduled to take place on December 9, 2008.
According to Dorje Shougden practitioners speaking through associations such as the Western Shugden Society (Western Shugden Society):
Article 10 of the Tibetan Charter in Exile promulgated by the Dalai Lama states that
In a speech to the Naumann Foundation in 1999, Helmut Gassner considers another explanation for this ban:
Dans son livre "The Tibetan Independence Movement: Political, Religious and Gandhian Perspectives", Jane Ardley d√©clare:
According to Ursula Bernis, the Chinese authorities seized controversy as early as 1996 in order to divide.
Ursula Bernis, referring to an essay by Jamyang Norbu from 1990, writes:
According to a report from France24, more than a spiritual divergence, this case is a political issue.
The Shugden people are openly accused by relatives of the Dalai Lama of supporting China and betraying the Tibetan cause.
On the Al Jazeera news channel, the Tibetan government's exile minister says:
The emergence of a new Palestinian prime minister and government is an important opening in this direction.
[...] The journalist states that "no one saw the attackers entering or leaving the monastery chamber.
So far there is no evidence that the followers of Shugden are behind these homicides. "
In one of his speeches Helmut Gassner evokes an internal track:
The writer Gilles van Grasdorff evokes other suspects in his book "The Secret History of the Dalai Llamas" (2009).
Protested on May 30, 2008 in Oxford in front of the Sheldonian Theater where the Dalai Lama had come to give a lecture.
Many had already demonstrated in London and Nottingham previously during the Buddhist leader's travels.
Likewise, the German Association of Buddhist Orders (BOD) declared itself formally dissociated from these manifestations throughout the world.
According to Lama Tseta, a former leader of the Shugden movement, China is organizing demonstrations of this movement targeting the Dalai Lama.
The philatelic and postal history of Christmas Island of the Indian Ocean is linked to its original economic situation until 1993.
Those issued by Australia Post since 1993 are also valid in Australia, and vice versa.
From March 1993 to February 2003, during the first ten years of its responsibility, Australia Post issued 153 stamps.
It is then managed by the District Officer, representing the settlement of the Straits Settlements.
Stamps of this colony bearing the effigy of British sovereigns are used.
The island's mail is transported to Singapore with material and migrant workers by a shipping line sponsored by the company.
The little mail seems to have been sent and received by the small group of Europeans present on the island.
During the Second World War, the island was conquered by Japanese forces on March 31, 1942.
Upon his release, the stamps of the British Military Administration for Malaya are available at Christmas.
Subsequently, the postal system follows political changes in the Malay Peninsula.
In addition, political reform has been accompanied by political changes aimed at rebalancing the economy.
The Malaysian dollar remains in circulation to facilitate the payment of workers of Chinese and Malay origins.
The first philatelic issue is issued urgently on October 15, 1958.
The same royal effigy is also used for registered postal stationery issued on May 18, 1959.
The first stamps are intended as a temporary issue, but it takes five years to produce the next series.
Finally, ten stamps are planned, drawn and engraved by G. Lissenden, Peter Morriss and Bruce Stewart.
A third series of common use is issued the same day, May 6, 1968, on the theme of the fish of the Indian Ocean.
The philatelic program does not exceed four emissions per year at most.
The main themes are local: fauna and flora, local history (political, economic and daily life).
Mail movements are carried out by phosphate cargo ships to Australia or steamers to Singapore.
In June 1974, the courier took advantage of the new scheduled airlines between the island, Perth and Singapore.
In the early 1990s, Australia decided to impose all Australian legislation on Christmas.
Between the 70s and the 90s, Australie was known as massive shotguns.
As a result, the Christmas and Australian stamps issued since 1993 are usable in these two territories.

The food pyramid is a visual guide that proposes to develop a balanced omnivorous diet.
In other countries, the structure of the old pyramid has been retained for drawing a food pyramid adapted to the national context.
The model of the food pyramid has emerged as the standard bearer of the concept of balanced diet.
The very concept of the food pyramid has its supporters, but also its detractors.
Critics criticize essentially the excessive space allocated to the family of cereals and starchy foods.
Nutritional recommendations have not been subject to profound upheaval in recent years, the structure of the pyramid has not changed.
Physical activity is the main modulable compartment of energy expenditure.
And our increasingly sedentary lifestyle contributes significantly to the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure.
Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is a priority public health goal.
But the reason why fruits and vegetables are so beneficial to health is unclear.
For most people, reaching four hundred grams of fruits and vegetables is already a famous challenge.
Cereals and starches remain the most important solid foundation of the building.
These sources of animal protein are useful, but often present in unnecessarily high amounts.

Alosa pseudoharengus is a fish of the shad family.
Born in the Atlantic Ocean, his French common name is gaspareau.
It looks like herring, which explains the origin of its Latin name.
Gaspareau, Gasparot, Gaspereau, alewife, sawbelly, spreau, kyak, kiack, river herring, glut herring.
The coloring of the flanks is silvery and iridescent, when freshly fished, and that of the back is gray-green.
Individuals returning from the sea may have golden or coppery reflections.
This fish is characterized by the presence of a black spot behind the gills just at the level of the eye.
It is also possible to observe several black lines above the lateral line in adults.
Gaspereau has relatively large eyes with well developed fat eyelids.
The dorsal fin may have 12-18 rays; the anal is rather short and can have 15-20 rays; and the caudal is forked.
This characteristic can be used to differentiate these two species that have a very similar appearance and biology.
It is also found, but rarely, in the Restigouche River and the Chaleur Bay area.
There are also a few introduced freshwater populations in many lakes in Ontario and New York State.
In the marine environment, gaspereau is generally found in coastal waters up to a depth of 100 meters.
At such a depth, the water temperature is 4 ¬∞ C.
The adult can withstand temperatures as high as 25 ¬∞ C, while the juvenile can live up to 30 ¬∞ C.
Spawning of "Alosa pseudoharengus" occurs in the spring and seems to be triggered by the temperature of the water.
Thus, populations farther south spawn earlier in the spring.
Females can lay from 48,000 to 360,000 eggs; the larger ones produce more eggs.
Fertilized eggs are about 1 mm in diameter and are adhesive for a few hours.
Females confined to freshwater are much smaller and can lay a quantity of around 12,000 eggs.
The hatching occurs after about 3 to 6 days, depending on the incubation temperature.
The optimum incubation temperature is around 20 ¬∞ C and egg survival decreases significantly with increasing temperature.
Most young people leave their natal stream around August-September.
The adult surviving reproduction returns to the sea shortly after spawning.
Young alewives typically feed three to five years at sea before breeding.
Freshwater individuals reach sexual maturity more rapidly (2-3 years).
Gaspereau feeds mainly on zooplankton (amphipods, copepods and mysids), but also small fish and fish eggs.
In freshwater environments, gaspereau larvae feed primarily on cladocerans.
Larvae are very selective in their choice of prey, unlike adult alewives.
Being light-sensitive, alewives practice a daily vertical migration that allows them to track zooplankton populations.
Alewife feeds little or no food during the spawning season.
It is estimated that only one young fish out of 80,000 laid eggs survives long enough to leave the spawning grounds.
This high mortality rate is due, among other things, to predation.
In the Great Lakes, alewives have contributed to the decline of many fish species due to competition.
There is also a species of mussel ("Anodonta implicata"), whose larval form, called glochydium, is a gaspereau parasite.
Glochydia attach to the gills and fins of gaspereau for the duration of their larval phase.
This fish is considered one of the easiest species to catch.
They are also used as bait in lobster and snow crab fisheries.
Alewife meat is white and sweet, but contains many bones.
Gaspereau are considered a nuisance species in the Great Lakes.
It is not popular for consumption, given its small size and many edges.
It can also cause public health problems during periods of mass mortality.
The public health system is in decline, mortality is on the rise and birth rates are falling.
It also contributes to the increase in sport fishing in this area.

The Fiat 619 is a versatile truck, carrier or semi-trailer tractor, manufactured by the Italian manufacturer Fiat V.I.
He is part of the huge family of Fiat V.I heavy trucks.
The Fiat 619 as a tractor-trailer was originally intended for Northern European markets.
It will first be manufactured in the Netherlands by Van Hool, who was very close to the Italian manufacturer at the time and then to Turin.
"H" type, with square shapes, was presented in 1970, the 619 benefited from it.
The Italian manufacturer launched the Fiat 619N1 and 619T1 in 1970.
This same cabin will be mounted on the Unic Isoard of the last series.
It will be replaced by the Fiat 170/190 in 1975, the first Fiat V.I universal truck.
which will be manufactured both in France at Unic and in Germany at Magirus.
The Fiat 619 has been produced in many foreign countries:
The second 619N1 / T1 series was never produced in Belgium but imported from Italy.
From 1973, it will be declined with the new cabin type "H", still under the name 619N.
It remained in production until 1994 and represented the heavy transport structure of the country.
In conclusion, a country's production structure can effectively determine its supply and demand for capital.
This model will be the first truck manufactured locally by the Argentine subsidiary of the Italian manufacturer Fiat V.I ..
From 1993, it receives the new Iveco cab type "T" identical to that of the Fiat-Iveco 190 Turbo.

The term live steam refers to reduced models of leisure or study, driven by a steam engine.
These are mostly model steam locomotives, steamboats or locomobiles.
The operation of a model live steam engine is close to that of a real machine.
For a small model, the simplicity of manufacturing the components takes performance.
As models to start, single-cylinder machines that require assistance to start.
Steam is produced from water and a heat source that can vary depending on the scale chosen.
In France, from 1880 to the 1930s, Radiguet and Massiot manufacture lively steam toys.
Before the appearance of the internal combustion engine, there are some achievements of steam airplanes.
It is located in the south of England in Kent, not far from Dover and still works today.
There are many suppliers of plans, foundries and models in Europe, and some craftsmen in France.
There are many models of democracy, some of which can not be exported.
In England, there is one of the oldest journals on the subject, founded in 1898 ,.
There is also information on beautiful achievements in specialized journals on naval model making.
The actual scale of reduction is obtained by dividing the gauge of the rails of the real model reproduced by the spacing of the model in reduction.
The types of steam generators (boiler) are mainly of the "smoke tube" type (see Boiler.
The engines used are of all types, single or double expansion for the most complex.
For shipbuilding, the fuel used is usually propane or butane gas.
The types of steam generators (boilers) are of the smoke tube type, water and flash.
The simplest model, which is also a toy, is nicknamed the POP POP.
The engines used are of all types, single, double or triple expansion or steam turbines.
There are also reproductions of steam trucks and automobiles.
The boilers are very simple and generally only have a hearth tube, without return tubes or economizer.
The steam generator (boiler) must include the following safety devices:
The vaporization of the water imposes minimum dimensions of the generators (cf.
It is for these reasons that the dimensions of the model are not exactly identical to the model reproduced.
For instantaneous vaporization, the same principle as the Serpollet generator is used, regulation is done by the introduction of water.
These systems being complex, on the basic models one often finds simple distributions said to eccentric.
Used mainly on boat models, it allows to recover water to increase the autonomy.
The use of gasoline is now completely abandoned, its use carries the risk of explosion and fire in case of rollover.
These models have sufficient autonomy to operate for several hours by drawing the feed water into tanks.
The control of the feed equipment is done manually or by model-making servomotors.
The boiler is equipped with a water level which makes it possible to check the quantity of water remaining in the boiler.
The heating is generally constant and regulated by modulating the gas valve.
When there is too much steam, the pressure rises until it escapes through the valve, safety organ.
There are gas regulators depending on the pressure of the boiler.
The heating is generally not adjustable, the amount of fuel is generally adapted to the boiler by the manufacturer.
There are several factors to manage, among the main draw is the most important.
The quality of the coal and its distribution have an influence on the behavior of the fire.
In some cases they are removable nozzles at the exhaust outlet.
The action on the distribution acts on the relaxation of the steam.

The most common are: carp, cat, crab, crane, dog, duck, fox, hare, monkey, raccoon, rat and sparrow.
Each animal form has its own alignment restrictions and special abilities.

He stands on his hind legs at the height of a normal man.
The front legs (wings, legs or fins) change into hands capable of grasping and using normal weapons.
In human form, a hengeyokai looks like a normal human being.

For example, a hengeyokai sparrow may have a sharp nose and a hengeyokai rat with long whiskers.

Florence Rey and Audry Maupin were presented as revolutionary anarchists or at least activists close to this movement.
This news has revived the debate on the death penalty in France.
It generated great media interest and inspired a major artistic production.
Florence Rey was nicknamed by the press the "killer born" or the "killer of cops".
Audry Maupin, 22, met in May 1994, Abdelhakim Dekhar nicknamed "Toumi", 28 years.
Audry and Abdelhakim rub shoulders with the extreme left, the anarchists and the alternative milieu.
Abdelhakim Dekhar lives in Aubervilliers and the Porte de Pantin is on his route.
Her car has already been taken to the pre-impounding area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPantin.
The place has no radio link, the alert is not likely to be immediate.
On 29 September 1994, her friend Florence Rey, 19, inquired about the purchase of a weapon by telephone, at La Samaritaine.
On the Monday evening of October 3, 1994, Audry Maupin and Abdelhakim Dekhar perform a reconnaissance at the pre-impounding of Pantin.
This money is used to buy two hoods and gloves in a motorcycle shop.
In fact, the tool in question will be used to saw the butts of rifles.
The plan is as follows: Florence Rey and Audry Maupin will take the RER, Abdelhakim Dekhar will go alone to Pantin.
Florence Rey and Audry Maupin will pass by the fence, peripheral side and will attack the sentry box.
Their output will be through the main entrance, rue de la Marseillaise.
Then, the trio will return to their squat of Nanterre by the subway.
At the ring road, a taxi is waiting for the traffic light to turn green.
She opens the left rear door of the Peugeot 405 station wagon and sits first.
Audry Maupin surprised by the reaction of Florence, is obliged to follow.
Inside the taxi is a passenger, Dr. Georges Monnier.
From the Place de la Nation, the couple plans to take the metro to Nanterre.
Amadou Diallo, terrified, assures that he can not drive and look for his papers at the same time.
The taxi driver Amadou Diallo, 49, escapes from the taxi and succumbs to Audry Maupin's shots.
Florence Rey from the back seat of the taxi, also begins to shoot.
The doctor takes advantage of the general confusion, opens his door and slips on the ground, out of the car.
The detonations echo the exchange of fire.
Florence Rey is now outside the taxi, kneeling, a bandolier slung over her shoulder, charging her shotgun.
Dr. Monnier just has time to hide behind a lamppost.
Audry Maupin seizes the service weapons of the guardians in agony and abandons one of the shotguns.
The human toll of the double shooting, Place de la Nation and Bois de Vincennes, is extremely heavy:
Biker Jean-Luc Poulouin is injured slightly during the pursuit race at Bois de Vincennes.
Alain Roussel, 43, touched on the scalp is brought to the hospital Saint-Antoine.
He is taken to H√¥tel-Dieu where he is hospitalized until October 15, 1994.
In the ranks of the majority, Philippe S√©guin excludes any debate on the reintroduction of the death penalty.
They pay tribute to their murdered colleague and call for better measures to protect them.
This news item comes in full debate in the National Assembly on the bill "security".
The so-called Pasqua security laws will finally be adopted on January 21, 1995.
Brought to the premises of the judicial police this Tuesday evening October 4, 1994, Florence Rey mura in silence.
It took more than ten hours of interrogation to finally give her name.
This almost complete silence, which lasted several months, is interpreted by psychiatrists as a "state of stupefaction".
In the absence of the accused's statements and clear motives, she is the subject of all comments.
This mediatized affair, involving a woman, provokes both fascination and aversion.
She engraves her imprint in the collective memory and inspires writers, musicians, artists, film directors.
Some journalists argue that their madness could be inspired by Oliver Stone's vision of "Born Killers".
They are based on the fact that a poster of the film is found in the squat of Florence Rey and Audry Maupin.
A debate is launched on the influence of violent films and on their prohibition.
Part of the press sees in the two young men heirs of Direct Action.
The hypothesis that the two young anarchists could have been the victims of manipulation has even been advanced.
On October 8, St√©phane and his friend C√©cile Debrenne leave France for Lisbon in Portugal.
Abdelhakim Dekhar stubbornly contests being the "third man" and exonerates himself by denouncing several far-left activists.
In this house resident Philippe and his fianc√©e Marie, as well as friends of the couple.
Dekhar also involves St√©phane Violet in the concealment of one of the weapons stolen from Pantin and which has never been found.
Abdelhakim Dekhar suggests that St√©phane Violet may have handed the gun to Maxime Aubin.
After a new arrest and search, without any results, Maxime Aubin and Emmanuelle Coupart are out of the question.
At trial, no evidence came to confirm the existence of a larger revolutionary group to which belonged Florence Rey and Audry Maupin.
They would have been caught in a spiral of violence that would have passed them.
Is he the watchman of the pre-impound Pantin, nicknamed the "third man"?
St√©phane Violet was actively sought after and under an international arrest warrant since June 29, 1995.
St√©phane Violet was released on February 23, 1996 and will be dismissed in this case, as will his friend C√©cile.
The investigating judge completed his investigations on 8 May 1997.
Florence Rey appeared prostrate and was almost unable to speak during the two weeks of the hearing.
His lawyers, masters Henri Leclerc and Olivia Cligman criticized him even publicly his attitude.
The co-accused Abdelhakim Dekhar aka "Toumi", is defended by Master Emmanuelle Hauser-Phelizon and Master Raphael Constant.
He claims to be the victim of a plot by the autonomous movement and his line of defense remains invariable.
According to him, he was charged by the Algerian government to infiltrate the French far left, in connection with Islamist networks.
The families of the victims declared themselves disappointed with the leniency of the verdict.
According to reports circulated at the time, she made several suicide attempts during the first years of her detention.
She refuses the tranquilizers and sleeping pills that usually accompany meals.
At the time of the trial, Florence Rey appears as a calm and discreet prisoner, appreciated by the other prisoners.
She helps her fellow inmates, who emphasize her benevolent disposition towards others.
The guards did not intervene and the helpers seem to have delayed while the detainee remained unconscious.
After her trial, Florence Rey waives her appeal on points of law.
The Court accordingly, noted on April 14, 1999 this discontinuance that makes final the conviction of Florence Rey.
The woman in Fleury-M√©rogis was transferred to the central house in Rennes in 2000.
She is supported by her mother who is very present during her detention.
She regularly attends the library and participates in the jury of a literary prize, the Wepler Prize.
Florence Rey is very independent in the professional choice, aware of the difficulty represented by her sensitive and mediatized file.
She has a degree in history and geography, but there are few opportunities for her to enter.
She completed her first internship at a company in February-March 2008 and a second internship for the same period, the following year.
Florence Rey was able to go out to complete these courses in Rennes.
She passes the tests of her BTS right after her release.
Michel Beuzon, director of the Penitentiary Center for Women in Rennes expresses the same opinion.
She is released through this process on May 2, 2009, after 15 years in prison.
The information concerning his detention is given in a communiqu√© issued by the prison administration.
The official announcement on June 25, 2009 of a release at the end of the sentence in the press, seems exceptional to legal professionals.
The union is calling for a debate on the execution of sentences in France.
The custody of the Seals, Michele Alliot-Marie, questioned on this subject, specifies that this release is in conformity with the law.
This release comes in a climate marked by several incidents in which police are targeted or killed.
A proposed law to remove the reductions of sentence is tabled by UMP deputies.
In addition, the case of the Tarnac group brings to the center of the news the question of the threat of groups of extreme left.
During the investigation and the two weeks of meetings, the case is regularly the "front page" of the press.
The journalists are particularly interested in the personalities of the two lovers, their families and the life of Florence Rey in prison.
This attention is prolonged after the trial and even beyond the end of the sentence.
The film is released in cinemas in January 2012 and Florence Rey is mentioned in the credits.
Monday, November 18, he seriously wounds a 23-year-old assistant photographer at the offices of the newspaper "Lib√©ration".

This is identified through video surveillance and traces of DNA found on the cartridges and the door of the car.
Of Algerian origin, he lives in Aubervilliers and is part of far-left circles.
Populist parties, both extreme right and extreme left, are gaining ground.

He stays with an Armenian friend Sebastian S. met in London and residing in Courbevoie, until November 10, 2013.
Dekhar appealed his verdict for domestic violence, appeal dismissed on October 16, 2013.
The man who hosted Abdelhakim Dekhar in the Hauts-de-Seine, is again auditioned by the Criminal Brigade on December 12, 2013.
Faced with investigators or Judge Quentin Dandoy, Dekhar refuses to speak about the facts and persists in his delusional explanations.
It also participates in the script and the feature film was released in theaters at the beginning of 2015.
The journalist Camille G√©vaudan, emphasizes by this title in the newspaper "Lib√©ration", a particularity of the media treatment of the Dekhar affair.
The relationship with current Paris events and this case dating back to 1994 is mentioned.
Internet users-investigators use the Internet as a means of investigation, on the lookout for the least digital trace and is no exception to the rule.
The Rey-Maupin affair has a great fascination and inspires many artists.
For Foenkinos, the couple unconsciously created an infernal machine from their first encounters.
She goes beyond them and leads them further and further to madness and the irreparable.
The day of the shooting, he could have done nothing or almost according to him.
He dissects the series of unforeseen and grains of sand that deflect the initial project.

Florence Rey inspires Patrick Besson in his collection "Sonnet for Florence Rey and other texts".
Both are figures of "outlaws", refractory to the established order, unable to find their place in society.

These games will be between Scotland and the United States, Tonga against the Cook Islands and Wales against Italy.
The C & D groups are made up of three teams each.
Each team plays an extra match against an opponent of the other group to determine the qualifying country in the quarter-finals.
Between Tonga and Scotland, this hard-fought game gives a Scottish winner a small margin (26-24).
Quickly, the big favorite, New Zealand, takes the measure of the Scots by imposing their match.
Exceeded, the Scots cash in the first period five tries to end up being 0-26 at halftime.
The five New Zealand trials are entered by Goodwin, Bromwich, Tuivasa-Sheck and Johnson.
Despite new intentions in the second half, the Scots cash two new tests of Tuivasa-Sheck and Vatuvei.
In the second quarter-final, Australia continues to advance towards the final.
First out of his group, the United States were not expected at this stage of the competition.
Soon, Cameron Smith's teammates take the measure of his opponent.
Australian coach Tim Sheens aligns his team and does not spare his selection.
Two Australians, Hayne and Morris, quadruple in this one-way match.
With eight tries in the first half (38-0), the Australians continued their efforts in the second half with four new tries.
This is the third straight game for Australia without conceding a single try since the opening match against England.
The Americans thought for a moment to try but it was canceled by video.
But at the same time, Kane Bentley and Duport get hurt in the first ten minutes.
Despite some strong times, France remains too imprecise and fails to score a second try.
Despite opportunities, the Samoans never managed to cross the goal line in the first act.
It was in the second half that Samoa finally scored their first try by Antonio Winterstein.
In this first semifinal, both selections are candidates for the title.
In a one-sided match, Australia lined up their home team to win 64-0 against Fiji.
With 11 tries in total, Australia joined New Zealand in the final for a rematch of 2008.
Both teams are the authors of a course without defeat before this final.
However, Australia achieves during this final a perfect score.
She leads 16-2 at halftime on tests from Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk.
Two more tries by Brett Morris are added for a final score of 34-2.
Australia recovers the trophy lost in 2008 by taking revenge on New Zealand who beat them in Brisbane.
New Zealand, defending champion, made a faultless run to the final.
She has, however, assumed her leadership role on the European continent.
However, the gap between the three nations, Australia, New Zealand and England, still seems important with the other selections.
On the other hand, in the quarterfinals, they measured the gap between them and Australia and New Zealand.
She owes her quarterback presence to her victory against Papua New Guinea.
The Papuans are one of the disappointments of this World Cup.
Beaten three times, the Papuans failed to qualify for the quarter-finals which was the goal.
For many observers, the World Cup is a real popular and economic success.
He stressed the importance of a competition that takes place at regular intervals in the future.
He is also pleased with the semifinal success at Wembley and the final at Old Trafford.
The semi-final between England and New Zealand was followed by 2.83 million viewers.
Economically, the 2013 edition has more benefits than the 2008 edition after a 2000 edition that had recorded losses.
The profit is estimated at between 5 and 6 million Australian dollars.
The presence of unpaid and free players such as Peter Wallace for Scotland is part of the popular character of the event.
The need to put in place an international calendar seems the big challenge in the future.
The international community places high hopes in a favorable outcome to the Copenhagen conference.
It examines the possibility of reviewing the organization of the Four Nations Tournament to expand it to six teams.
The competition is broadcast in France on BeIn Sport which is committed to broadcast all the matches live.
In sociology, gender identity refers to the kind to which a person has a deep sense of belonging.
In the latter case, we can more specifically speak of the "social gender" of the person.
This identity is conferred from birth, or even before because of the use of ultrasound.
Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation (heterosexuality, bisexuality or homosexuality).
He is also credited with introducing the term "gender identity" at the 1963 International Psychoanalytic Congress.
The psychoendocrinologist John Money also played an important role in developing early theories about gender identity.
His book "Man and Woman, Boy and Girl" was widely used in universities.
Albert Bandura's theory of social learning captures some of the aspects of gender identity.
This theory directly inspired by behaviorism emphasizes the role of the imitation of behavioral models.
Bandura defended the idea that children imitated the models of their sex more frequently.
This theory, however, does not provide an exhaustive explanation of all the psychological and biological processes involved.
Lawrence Kohlberg, in the 1960s, proposed a cognitive model explaining and describing the development of gender identity.
Once the child realizes what kind he belongs to, he adjusts his behavior to this scheme.
These studies suggest that the age of formation of gender identity is around two or three years.
Access to hormonosubstitution and sex reassignment surgery is usually controlled by doctors.
Transsexuals may have felt obliged to give the "right" answer in the hope of getting hormone replacement therapy.
They can therefore be categorized with a gender they feel is inappropriate or foreign.
Social gender is attributed to apparent biological sex from birth.
In some cultures there are other social genera, for example, surgically castrated males, eunuchs (see also hijra).
The link between gender identity and social gender can be unclear.
In some Polynesian cultures, fa'afafine is a third genus at the same level as men and women.
They are biologically male but behave in a way that is considered typically feminine.
According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i, fa'afafine from Samoa are physiologically incapable of reproduction.
Fafafine are accepted as a natural genus and are neither discriminated nor despised.
In the culture of the Indian subcontinent, a hijra is considered neither male nor female.
Most are biologically male or intersexed, but some are biologically female.
Recent research suggests that two out of one hundred people may have an intersex characteristic.
In particular, recent research suggests four main areas of action that governments may wish to consider.
Transgender people are those whose gender identity or reproductive organs and chromosomes differ from traditional definitions.
Libido and the ability to express one's sexual desire are changed, but gender identity can remain the same.
He energetically refused his new female name, tore off her dresses, wanted to play cars with her twin brother.
The term gender identity thus goes beyond the only biological sex determined by the external sex organs.
Some are only at puberty when the secondary sex characteristics differ from what was expected.
Others only appear when a person wants to procreate and realizes that she is sterile.
Still others come to light only when a person has a serious illness and extensive testing confirms it.
Indeed, the status of BNPPA does not allow it to have an intermediary role (or broker) on the markets.
Its international presence (Europe, United States, Asia ...) allows it to be a leading player on the financial markets.
It is designed to preserve the international financial markets and not the stability of the emerging economies of the periphery.
In addition, international financial markets consider the fundamentals of Colombia's economy sound.
But these rates depend on international financial markets and not what China does.
Europe focuses on the regulation of financial markets with the aim of moderating future crises.
Sami al-Arian graduated with honors in 1978, in electrical engineering and in 1985 with a doctorate in engineering.
In 1977, at the age of 19, Sami al-Arian created the Arab Muslim Youth League in Florida.
He allegedly organized the support of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in the United States.
The United States has a supporting role to play, but which organization should take over?
Sami al-Arian was suspended from his teaching post in December 2001.
In February 2003, the FBI arrested Sami al-Arian and three associates.
On December 6, 2005, Sami al-Arian was sentenced to 18 months in jail and deportation.
The simpler the nervous system, the simpler and more stereotyped the behavior (insects, annelids ...).
On the contrary, the more complex the nervous system, the more the behavior is elaborated (mammals, and especially hominids).
By simplifying, we can schematize the main phases of reproductive behavior.
1) Odors and especially pheromones can exchange sexual signals between potential partners.
6) The tactile stimulations of the clitoris (and the penis for the male) during copulation go back to the brain (blue arrows).
7) The activation of the reward system induces learning that optimizes copulation, especially the development of sexual motivation.
This article describes in detail the organization and neurobiological control of reproductive behavior in non-primate mammals.
It is the existence of an incomplete instinctual organization, requiring complementary learning, which is sometimes at the origin of non-reproductive sexual behavior.
In non-primate mammals (rodents, canids, ovids, etc.), reproductive behavior, and in particular copulation, is relatively stereotyped.
The reproduction behavior is generally divided into two phases:
This exploration is all the longer as the rat is sexually inexperienced.
He sometimes rubs against the female, and passes below or above her.
During this friction, a behavior apparently of marking the female by the urine of the male is frequently observed.
The estrous spleen responds to the male's stimulations by leaping and leaking behavior.
If the male is not experienced enough, the female can also take the initiative by pushing the flanks of her partner.
During riding, the male palpates and hugs the female's flanks with her front legs.
The male performs pelvic thrusts that allow intromission of the penis and ejaculation.
In the male, ejaculation is accompanied by spasmodic contractions of the skeletal muscles.
After copulation, the male usually cleans his genital area and then goes into a period of inactivity.
These different factors determine the development and dynamics of reproductive behavior.
Hormones, and especially sex hormones, activate, coordinate and control most other factors in reproductive behavior.
Sex hormones have two main roles: an organizational role and an activation role.
During development, the sex hormones cause the sexual differentiation of the body into male and female.
At the time of reproductive maturity, hormones also have a role of activation and control of behavior.
In conclusion, hormones are a major factor in reproductive behavior.
In mammals, innate sensory structures, specialized in the detection of sex pheromones, are found inside the nose:
"Important note": Pheromones are the main mode of communication of living organisms.
In mammals, there are 3 types of innate sexual reflexes: motor, autonomic and neuroendocrine.
The brain system of rewards / reinforcements was discovered by Olds & Milner in 1954.
It is localized in the medial preoptic area and especially in the nucleus accumbens.
The main neuromediators of reward / reinforcement are dopamine, endogenous cannabinoids and endogenous opioids.
In the rat, an aversive stimulus (disgusting smell), but coupled with ejaculation, becomes appetitive.
Rewards / reinforcements cause the repetition of the activity that activated these processes.
These elements, which are acquired during the development period of the organization, are:
According to current neurobiological knowledge, the innate coding of such cognitive abilities is difficult to explain.
This hypothesis of innate mental images that would guide behavior is even more difficult to explain in the human species.
Based on current knowledge in genetics and developmental biology, it is inexplicable.
How does an animal do to know that it must, to reproduce, mate with a partner of the same species?
Learning the characteristics of congeners is therefore predetermined by the development context and is always done.
How does an animal do to know attitudes and signals to engage in sexual behavior?
Indeed, animals raised in social isolation from birth are unable to perform normal social and sexual interactions.
These fun activities are frequently repeated because they provide rewards, especially during the development period.
This sexual motivation to seek physical genital contact would not be innate.
It is conceivable that there are innate knowledge, representations or motor sequences specific to vaginal intercourse.
Nevertheless, several experiences suggest that this particular motivation is acquired during the development, thanks in particular to the genital rewards.
Sex pheromones activate the reward system and induce learning.
How does a male do to know that it is necessary to ride on the back of the female, from behind, in order to copulate?
The ability of the genito-genital positioning of the body (the sequence of the monte in non-primate mammals) is not innate.
Genito-genital positioning is learned during development, during the thousands of bodily interactions with congeners.
The innate structures (sexual reflexes, vomeronasal organs, olfactory connections ...) develop, as well as the reward system and learning abilities.
In this way, all the innate and acquired elements allowing reproductive behavior become functional before puberty.
Melatonin, through its action on gonadotropin-releasing neurons, activates sexual behavior during the breeding season.
The body is thus ready to perform the behavioral sequences leading to copulation.
In addition, pheromones appear to be the factor of sexual orientation.
There does not seem to be any sexual preference in rodents.
The analysis of the innate factors allowing the reproductive behavior highlights a remarkable characteristic:
This means that in the general organization plan of mammals, there is a true reproductive behavior.
The general framework of this model is valid for all non-primate mammals.
The reproduction behavior remains functional, it is only less optimized.
The control exercised by hormones and pheromones is not always perfect or total.
And the higher up the phylogenetic scale, the more the brain is developed, the more the hormonal control weakens.
It is therefore not "biologically abnormal" to observe non-reproductive sexual activities in non-primate mammals.
Is it an anomaly, a pathology, a dysfunction of the sexual instinct?
We notice here that the modifications of the behavior of reproduction have their origin in early learning.
And these learnings depend on the characteristics of the environment and the interactions between animals.
Finally, these characteristics always result from interactions between genes and the environment.
On the contrary, the importance of rewards / reinforcements and cognition has become major.
Reproductive behavior has given way to erotic behavior.

Avian pox is a viral infection that seems to affect all birds.
It is caused by a group of viruses of the family Poxviridae and the genus "Avipoxvirus".
This disease is widespread worldwide, but more common in tropical countries.
Since then, countries around the world have made their central bank independent.
For dozens of countries around the world, the AIDS epidemic threatens all aspects of development.
There are several virus species in the world known to be responsible for smallpox.
The forms of the disease they cause are antigenically similar:
One of the characteristics of these viruses is to be of unusually large size and to have a genome that is also rather large.
Another peculiarity is their resistance to dehydration and heat (tropical ambient temperatures).
Avipoxviruses can remain active while being dispersed on aerosols and dust particles.
They then easily infect the membranes and mucous membranes of the "dry lanes" of the upper respiratory tract.
It has long been considered rather benign, except in livestock.
Like other avian viruses, it can be mechanically transmitted by biological vectors such as stinging mosquitoes.
Like its human counterpart in humans, this virus causes a high mortality rate in infected birds.
The effects of the infection could significantly increase the difficulty of breathing, eating, drinking infected birds.
They take the form of proliferative and necrotizing dermatitis;
There are two great, very different forms of the disease:
This form seems to be propagated most often by biting insects (especially mosquitoes).
Poxviruses used as vaccines against infectious diseases but also against cancer are currently under development.

The Famous Grouse is a Scotch whiskey brand produced in Scotland, and known worldwide.
This blend was first produced by Matthew Gloag & Son Ltd., and is now produced by the Edrington Group.
Matthew Gloag was a grocer and wine merchant in Perth, Scotland.
In 1860, his son William Gloag took over the business and started producing blends.
In 1896, William's son, Matthew (named after his grandfather) also took over the business.
Business investment is also weak, although large companies have very high cash reserves.
He created the blend "The Grouse Brand" in 1897, which was later renamed "The Famous Grouse".
He began filming in his homeland in 1931 before moving to the United States in 1935.
He is best known for his performances in many Hollywood horror movies of the 1940s.

The stuccos are mostly large figures in high reliefs accompanied by falling fruit.
The stucco framing fresco represent two male and female satyrs and their children.
The two satyrs would illustrate the result of ignorance, leading to vice.
The stuccoes slightly illustrate the History of Alexander the Great, with notably "Alexander cutting the Gordian knot" under the fresco.
The king is surrounded by soldiers, bourgeois and peasants, dressed in Roman and Gallo-Roman costumes.
The central fresco could symbolize the misfortunes engendered by treachery and vengeance, punished by divine wrath.
This coolness will also be a direct evocation of the tra√Ætrise du conn√©table de Bourbon, which has also been dotted with the Spanish ennemis.
In the fifth south bay is painted by the Rosso the fresco of "The Death of Adonis".
The stucco represents a young man on the left and a young woman on the right.

After a few years of practice at FC Annonay, Cl√©ment Grenier arrived at Olympique Lyonnais at the age of 11.
He repeats his scales with the various OL trainers who make him work daily.
It continues to progress through the national championships bringing together the best teams and the best players in the hexagon.
He won the French championship of professional reserves 3 consecutive years between 2009 and 2011.
In full reflection, he wondered about the best position to evolve and could move towards a role of relaying medium.
Cup he won on April 28, 2012 against Quevilly (1-0), coming into play for the last 24 minutes.
During the summer break, he won the Champions Trophy in New York against Montpellier, then fresh champion of France.
On February 17, 2013, he scored twice against Bordeaux, his first in Ligue 1.
On July 11, 2013, Cl√©ment Grenier extended his contract with Olympique Lyonnais until 2016.
He injured the adductors at the end of the 2013-2014 season and stayed away from the field until April 2015.
This injury deprives him of the World Cup in Brazil and a large part of the 2014-2015 season.
In this context, a large part of the developing world is thus relieved by the outcome of the negotiations.
It misses the start of the season in Lyon, being away from the field for a long time.
He is back on the field with the Lyon reserve team at the end of November.
He is used on this occasion in an unusual position for him, in the left lane of the attack Lyon.
On 9 January 2016, the day of the inauguration of OL's new stadium, he serves Lacazette, who opens the score against ESTAC.
Grenier is European Under-19 champion with the Team de France in 2010.
On June 5, 2013, he honors his first selection against Uruguay.
He will play 20 minutes during the match Belgium-France, he will reap a yellow card just entered the game.
Finally touched adductors, he forfeits 6 days from the start of the world.
The Civil Code of Lower Canada is an old Quebec law that governed Quebec's private law.
From 1608 to 1664, the customary law that applies to the inhabitants of New France depends on their province of origin in France.
In 1791, the "Constitutional Act" divides the Province of Quebec into two:
In Lower Canada, civil law becomes very complex because of the multiplicity of sources.
Ren√©-√âdouard Caron writes a memoir on the subject in 1859:
"What are the laws of the country currently in force, and who should all enter the codes to do?"
If a country can no longer make the necessary contribution, others must do it for it.
The said Act creates a codification commission with three commissioners and two secretaries, all lawyers of the Bar of Lower Canada.
To translate into English many terms at the origin of French law, the commissioners often use those of Scottish law.
The Commission also proposed 217 amendments to lower Canadian law, of which the Legislature adopts almost everything.
Thomas-Jean-Jacques Loranger wrote in 1873, in his "Commentary on the Civil Code of Lower Canada":
The new Code introduces several major reforms in lower Canadian civil law:
However, it retains several principles that are abolished in France under the Code of 1804 (for example, trust).
It took place in Geneva, publicly between 1932 and 1934, then more discreetly until May 1937.
It should not be confused with the UN Conference on Disarmament, which still exists today.
During the inter-war period, the arms race was considered one of the causes of the First World War.
This principle was inscribed both in the Treaty of Versailles and in the Covenant of the League of Nations.
During the 1920s, draft international treaties against the arms race took three directions.
These conferences concerned only the naval field, and only the countries mentioned above.
These Conferences culminated in, inter alia, the 1922 Washington Treaty and the 1930 London Naval Treaty.
Third, most major powers agreed on the need to control the arms trade.
This control was to be particularly severe in Africa and the Arab countries.
For France, collective security was therefore a condition of disarmament, which was itself a condition of peace.
France tried unsuccessfully to set up an effective mechanism of collective security.
For that, she relied on the League of Nations and the pacifist movements that flourished in Europe.
He failed at the refusal of the United States, the USSR, and Germany.
A change of majority in the British parliament thwarted the project, the new government refusing a binding agreement.
By the end of the 1920s, no solution to the arms race was looming.
But in spite of everything, the diplomatic climate, in the years 1924 to 1929, seemed more favorable than ever.
All its meetings were held at Geneva, the seat of the League of Nations.
It then meets during the last two sessions, in the spring of 1928 and in the spring of 1929.
The USSR, which had not taken part in the first sessions, proposed, with some insistence, a general disarmament project.
This project, which ultimately provided for the total suppression of all armed forces, was utopian.
As we can see, these were two very fragile principles that no concrete measure could reinforce.
The two main organs of the conference were the General Committee and the Bureau.
The bureau was composed of the President of the Conference, the Honorary President, and fourteen Vice-Presidents.
The President of the Conference was the British Prime Minister Arthur Hendersen.
The honorary president was Federal Councilor Giuseppe Motta, President of the Swiss Confederation.
The chairmen and vice-chairmen of certain special commissions were also admitted to the office of the Conference on Disarmament.
The Conference for Disarmament began to sit from February 2nd, 1932.
The debates of the General Committee, as well as of certain committees, were public.
Public opinion played a significant role in the international diplomacy of that time, which was a new development.
It influences national and international public opinion, but not in depth.
In addition, States were supposed to make part of their land, naval and air forces available to the Council.
In this way, a kind of international army was created under the command of the League of Nations.
This project met both the security objectives of France, and that of the Conference, disarmament.
On June 22, 1932, the President of the United States, Herbert Hoover, proposed another original plan.
The major drawback of this plan was the establishment of two rigid categories, "offensive" and "defensive" weapons.
The liberation of an occupied territory, for example, can be considered both as an attack and as a defense.
In July 1932, Germany withdrew for the first time from the Conference (the final withdrawal took place in 1933).
It demanded equality of treatment, and therefore, military parity with France.
The war fleet was also severely reduced, and Germany was not allowed to have an air force.
By slamming the door, he hoped later to be able to return to the Conference in a position of strength.
His policy in Geneva was not fundamentally different from that of the previous government.
He tried to obtain the most favorable clauses so that German rearmament could be as rapid as possible.
In March 1933, Japan left the League of Nations and the Conference on Disarmament.
He intended to protest against the report of the League of Nations, which condemned the Japanese aggression in Manchuria without appeal.
The departure of Japan put an end to any hope of global disarmament.
But as it was especially in Europe that the destiny of the world was played out, the Conference on Disarmament followed its course.
In May 1933, the United Kingdom proposed its "McDonald Plan", named after the British Prime Minister.
This plan partly met the demands of Germany, and was very unfavorable to France.
For example, he did not take into account the existence of paramilitary militias of the Nazi Party, SA and SS.
France, supported by the United States, insisted that essential modifications be made to the McDonald Plan.
Among these measures was the total suppression of the German paramilitary forces, and a system of inspection and control.
Hitler, in fact, did not only want a "place in the sun" for the German Reich.
Hitler was convinced that this issue was without consequences for Germany.
The treaties and alliances he concluded in the following years enabled him to prepare Germany for war.
In the following years, Germany was pressed several times, notably by the British, to return to the Conference on Disarmament.
The French, for their part, began a policy of rearmament, while continuing to participate in the Conference.
These questions had already been debated in 1932-1933, but the discussions had resulted in a total blockage.
Yet considerable preparatory work had been done in previous years.
The 1929 draft was less successful and was the subject of bitter negotiations.
At that time, a distinction was made between "private manufacture" of armaments and "state manufacture".
But at the same time, some felt that the control of "state-making" should be less strict.
For the delegations of the major arms importing countries, this distinction made no sense.
By the end of 1933, the Conference was deadlocked.
Moreover, he did not distinguish between "private manufacturing" and "state manufacturing".
These qualities were to overcome the traditional reluctance of arms importing countries.
Unfortunately, this project, which was still discussed for months, was coming too late.
Italy invades Abyssinia, in spite of the protests of the League of Nations.
The same year, the death of Arthur Henderson, President of the Conference, symbolically symbolized the failure of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.
The only player qualified under this rule so far is John Tavares.
Until 1970, the leagues, now Major Junior and Junior A, were both known as Junior A.
In 1970, they were divided into Tier I Junior A or Junior Major A and Tier II Junior A.
Some leagues who define themselves as Junior A operate outside the control of CJHL and Hockey Canada.
The Junior B was created in 1933, to differentiate the teams able to dispute the Memorial Coup√© and the others.
Playdowns are played between 6 of the 7 different regional leagues in the province.
In Quebec, Junior D is now known as Junior B and is run by minor hockey associations.
The last big league Junior D is not even a league of D at all.
In 16 teams, the league renamed itself "junior development league" in the 1990s, and SOJHL in 2006.
In recent years, the SOJHL has tried to proclaim itself junior league C.
Teams at the lower level tend to function as extensions of local minor hockey systems.
Although some NHL players come from lower levels of junior hockey, they are rare.
There is no national governing body at these levels, only at the provincial level.
As in Canada, junior hockey in the United States is divided into several levels.
Outside of the CHL, the United States does not have major junior hockey.
The USHL provides an alternative to major junior hockey for young people who want to play in the NCAA.
When playing in the USHL, all player expenses are paid by the team, no membership or equipment fees.
The Tier I Junior A is usually an NCAA feed system.
Currently, the North American Hockey League is the only Tier 2 Junior A league in the United States.
The NAHL is primarily comprised of teams playing in the central and southwestern parts of the United States.
The Fed is not just the Central Bank of the United States: it's the Central Bank of the United States.
This level was formerly known as Junior B or C before the 2006 Tier A I / II / III rename.
2 Junior C leagues, the Continental Hockey Association, and the Southeast Junior Hockey League.
Youth teams are not independent and are usually affiliated with a professional club.
The age levels are based on those defined by the international federation, so in France, we have:

Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Rennes 1
It was originally founded in 1460 in Nantes before being moved to Rennes in 1735.
Besides law, this university can teach other traditional disciplines (Arts, Theology, and Medicine).
Nantes is entirely turned towards commerce and its elites are not interested in this institution.
Consequently, the Faculty of Law is effectively transferred to Rennes in 1735 where the Parliament of Brittany sits.
The faculties of literature, theology and medicine are kept in Nantes.
In 1793, the National Convention ordered the suppression of all Universities and Faculties.
In 1806, Napoleon reorganized the entire French educational system by establishing the Imperial University, the Faculty of Law was reestablished in Rennes.
The faculties of science and letters will follow in the following decades.
The faculty provides courses in law and political science.
The courses are broken down into 3 licenses, including a professional license, 7 master 1 (M1) and 12 master 2 (M2).
In addition, the UFR has 7 research centers and an antenna in Saint-Brieuc.
She is also behind a recognized business law degree.
European Union law and certain national laws, referring to this notion of enterprise, seemed to prove him right.
The notion of trader has nonetheless remained largely preponderant in positive law.
More recently, the doctrine of company law has identified a fundamental notion within legal rules: economic activity.
Economic activity is therefore in all respects controlled by rules, regulations and restrictions.
It would be at the center of a genuine original system, the law of economic activities.
In the mind of its inventor, the law of economic activities will be at the origin of a great upheaval or even a conceptual revolution.
However, the economic upheavals also bring about political upheavals.
The concept of enterprise remains the matrix of this system since "its prime characteristic is economic activity".
Economic activity and corporate profits would have been smaller and public deficits higher.
Animal is the first studio album of American singer Kesha.
The album is reissued in 2011 with the EP Cannibal, under the title "Animal + Cannibal".
For this album Kesha Sebert has worked with different producer and music writer like Lukasz Gottwald (Dr.
In less than two months, the song ranks first in Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, United States.
The US, Canada and the UK have all recently lowered their interest rates.
This allows Kesha to sign a contract for several albums with RCA Records.
Some appreciate its fun, its natural, when others say that it is childish and that it does not seem sincere.
"Tik Tok" was released on August 7, 2009, becoming a worldwide success ranking number one in eleven countries.
Luke has just finished producing titles for Kelly Clarkson's "Breakaway" album (2004) and is looking to produce other artists.
Two of these demos he receives are those of Katy Perry and Kesha.
He particularly likes Kesha's demo, which features a country ballad and a trip-hop title.
This improvisation makes her stand out from the crowd of artists that Luke listens to and recalls.
As a result of this, at 18, Kesha signs with the Dr. label
After signing on Luke's label, she signed with David Sonenberg's management agency.
Even though it is signed on Luke's label, Kesha is not a priority, being busy with other projects.
In a few months the song became a world number one.
As a result, several labels arouse interest in Kesha, including RCA Records, with whom she has signed.
Kesha worked on "Animal" for seven years before its release, and wrote nearly 200 songs for the album.
"Animal" was originally supposed to contain 12 songs, but the abundance of written songs added 2 songs.
The title of the album comes from a personal experience with a barracuda that pursued it, trying to attack it.
She believes the album conveys a message of carelessness to young women.
"Animal" uses software like Auto-Tune and vocoder to modify Ke $ ha's voice, as well as musical samples.
The song "Boots & Boys" recalls "Suicide Blonde" of INXS, but from a feminine point of view according to David Jeffries.
The photographs in the cover were taken by Shelby Dunca.
The title of the album is located at the bottom right, written in gradient of red-purple glitter.
The artist's name is on the top left, written as "Ke $ ha", gold glitter.
Monica Herrera from Billboard Magazine explains that the album is not meant for cardiac people.
To date, the album has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide.

It is not Darcy who comes to see her, it is she who rushes to Pemberley.
She confesses crying to Darcy when he insists that she "trust him".
She has a role as a protective and responsible elder sister, explaining herself patiently but firmly with her mother.
She plays piano and sings (at Lucas Lodge and Rosings).
She is generally full of restraint, but also of assurance, and she vigorously expresses her opinions.
His aversion to Darcy and his attraction to Wickham are marked.
As in the novel, Darcy remains a character in withdrawal, indecipherable.
The physical and stiffness of David Rintoul accentuate his haughty, distant, taciturn and frozen.
The interest Elizabeth has in him is shown only by the distant, obsessive gaze with which he fixes it.
It is with these two characters that Fay Weldon took the most liberties.
Priscilla Morgan plays a less cartoon Bennett than in the novel.
She is, however, very foolish, spooky, quickly irritated, always in movement and chatting constantly in a high-pitched voice.
He studies chess games alone, sometimes playing tric-trac with Elizabeth, the only one of his daughters he seems to enjoy.
He solicits his advice, that he does not listen, but their relations are rather affectionate.
The couple of the two youngest show a more superficial complicity.
The nearsighted glasses and the fringe worn by Tessa Peake-Jones give her a naive and childish air.
She emphasizes her precocity, refuses the modest lace in her cleavage, makes the eye to Wickham.
Natalie Ogle is small, but gives Lydia a pretty strong physical presence.
Establishing a strong physical presence throughout the country will take time and be expensive.
Malcolm Rennie, who is a massive, tall actor, plays a particularly heavy, vulgar, ridiculous and clumsy Mr Collins.
At the same time arrogant and humble, he speaks with a loud voice and his stereotypical phrases of excuses return as a leitmotiv.
Charlotte, played by Irene Richard, has a rather important role, almost more important than that of Jane Bennet.
Her haughty coldness makes her a very likely relative of the cold Darcy.
Fay Weldon wrote most of his reviews and advice.
We see Collins approve them and Charlotte put some into practice.
His confrontation with Elizabeth at Longbourn took place in the living room where Mrs. Bennet introduced him, but finally Elizabeth fired her curtly.
Peter Settelen plays a friendly and warm Wickham, very close to Elizabeth, who confesses his disappointment to see Jane abandoned.
Osmund Bullock gives him a little dignity and a lot of affability.
All adaptations of pre-1967 American novels are shot in black and white and in the studio.
Darcy is often shown standing, motionless, a little behind, staring at Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth is at the piano in Rosings, the young people, filmed in a medium shot, frame her without much scenic play.
The characters most often converse quietly, which creates an impression of slowness a little solemn and formal.
Begins to appear in this version a systematic use of outdoor scenes.
The contents of this letter are said in voice-over during his reading by Elizabeth.
We see Darcy move away more and more, and the field gradually widens, to follow his silhouette fading into the distance.
It is made in a park alley lined with tall green trees, under which the two protagonists roam slowly.
The staging thus tries to script the many correspondences of the characters and the comments of the narrator.
In this adaptation the music highlights Darcy's fascination with Elizabeth.
He belonged to the Arab tribe Bani Nabhan in northern Palestine.
He was born in Ijzim village, Haifa district, in 1909.
He worked as a lecturer in Islamic law or sharia law.
The Islamic environment in which grown Taqiuddin contributed to the consolidation of his personality.
Thanks to his grandfather, he was introduced to the world of Ottoman Caliphate politics.
With greater clarity in Chinese and US policies, the two economies should become more dynamic.
Upon his return to Palestine, he worked as a teacher from 1932 to 1938 and then reoriented himself to the bench.
In his eyes, education and all curricula were corrupted by Western colonialist countries.
He also held the position of legal assessor from 1940 to 1945.
The exodus from Palestine that followed brought him to Syria.
He defined the thought process, and how he reached the state of concepts.
He believed that the first important step was the fight against the confusion reigning among Muslims.
Thus, the Hizb ut-Tahrir develops an argumentative method on almost all questions.
Nabhani claims that Islam is based on a rational belief and not a blind faith.
The political activities of Sheikh Taqiuddin an-Nabhani started very early.
He also had many contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood, and exchanged views with Sayyid Qutb.
He also maintained ties with Palestinian leader Amin al-Husseini during the Palestinian mandate.
Nabhani left Palestine for Syria in 1953 and moved to Lebanon in 1959.
Many of his al-Azhar colleagues testified to his tireless activity in attending circles of political and Islamic studies.
He says that the Ummah has resigned against the greedy colonial powers.
The Jordanian government reacted instantly by issuing a decree banning it and declaring its activities illegal.
Hizb ut-Tahrir ignored this action and continued work in Al-Quds, al-Khalil, Nablus and other towns and villages.
The government's brutal reactions were to follow against the Party members, and they continue to this day.
In 1954, Party members were banned from giving lectures in mosques.
Despite the harsh repression, the Party has been able to expand enormously, extending its work in the Muslim world.
In the course of 1955, al-Nabhani left Jordan for a short trip to Damascus and Beirut.
The Jordanian government has forbidden him by decree to return to the kingdom.
During a trip to Iraq in 1973, al-Nabhani was jailed by the Iraqi security services and severely tortured.
He died in Beirut on December 20, 1977 and was buried in the cemetery of al-Auza'i.
Petershausen Abbey is a former imperial abbey founded in 983 by the Benedictines near Konstanz secularized in 1806.
It houses among other things today a branch of the regional archaeological museum of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
The translation of some of his relics from Rome to Constance is done during great festivities.
Bishop Gebhard will be proclaimed blessed in this same church in 1124.
Theoderic gives monks to the Abbey of Neresheim and participates in the Cluniac reform of the Abbey of Wagenhausen.
Petershausen Abbey burns in 1159 and has to be rebuilt until 1180.
Fr√©d√©ric II gives him the impietial imm√©diatet√©, putting the question of the privileges of √âv√™que et du Pape.
The monks are deprived of certain rights of trade, must pay additional taxes.
The citizens of Constance seize certain lands and the abbey must undergo several iconoclastic episodes of "Bildersturm".
The bourgeois galvanizing the people seize the abbey in 1530 and burn part of it.
The abbot of Petershausen was devastated in 1575, one from the prelates of the collapse of the prelates of Souabe, who was subject to the rule of Empire.
This confederation, known as Upper Swabia, is the basis of other congregations still active today.
The abbeys of Zwiefalten, Ochsenhausen, Mehrerau, Isny ‚Äã‚Äãand Wiblingen will be joined immediately by this congregation, followed by others.
In the meantime, the abbey has a brilliant last time, after the difficult period of the Thirty Years War.
The world has gone through a difficult period in the last six years.
Certainly abbots are deposed by the prince-bishops of Constance, but the abbey is reconstructed both materially and spiritually.
She is in charge of developing the practice of confession and mutual support, material, social and spiritual.
Pacts and treaties are signed with Constance, √úberlingen and the Teutonic Knights of Mainau Island.
The abbey is secularized from 1802 to 1806, that is to say that his property is confiscated and his monks dispersed.
His son Frederick Charles of Baden calls himself "Count of Petershausen" and lives in the apartments of the former abbot.
The abbey is transformed into a military hospital during the wars of 1813-1814 and barracks in 1850.
The abbey was occupied by the French army from 1945 to 1977 (historical service of armies).
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita is an expert in political science born in 1947.
He studied first at the University of New York City, then at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
He manages to join the author in 1972 at the University of Rochester, to work on the application of mathematical models to political analysis.
In 2005, the magazine "Foreign Policy" ranked him among the ten most influential political science experts in the world.
For this, they must rally a part of the public opinion (in a different way in a dictatorship or a democracy).
But the forces of public opinion on which the democracies are based rarely take shape under ideal conditions.
His sculptures can be seen around the world in private collections, museums and open sites.
Markets around the world have opened up to European exports and capital.
He lives and works mainly in Paris and carves granite in his workshop in Fresnay-l'Eveque, near Chartres in Eure-et-Loir.
The Harada family was a farmer and his father, Niichiro, became a blacksmith before working in the building.
Niichiro and his wife, Kikuno Harada, had 3 boys and 3 girls, Tetsuo was the youngest.
His father, aware of the importance of education, pushed his son while leaving him the choice of directions he wanted to take.
Tetsuo was attracted by history, art, sculpture, painting, architecture ...
Harada attended school in Niitsu High School before going to study in Tokyo.
In 1970, he made a monumental sculpture in white granite, "The silence and the sea" and made his first exhibitions.
He also exhibited three years in a row at Kodo Bijutsu Kyokai and made several solo exhibitions in galleries.
In France, he goes to Paris and Chartres as well as to the south of France.
For Tetsuo Harada, it is also the symbol of the link between East and West, Buddhism and Catholicism.
In 1975, he met the sculptor Pedro Tramullas with whom he quickly became a friend.
Tramullas, dont le p√®re was a peintre, was the name of a family suffering from the dictatorship of Franco.
The Fountain of Sainte-Menehould: In 1986, Tetsuo Harada realizes a fountain placed in the district of Vertes Voyes in Sainte-Menehould.
This sculpture is shaped in a gray granite encrusted with pink granite from the south of France, in the Tarn.
It represents a landscape composed of cobblestones, pebbles and a set of sculptures.
Three blocks of granite are superimposed and form a column five meters high.
In Japan, it is impossible to build a sculpture so high and heavy because of earthquakes.
This sculpture was commissioned for the tax office of Saint-Brieuc in Brittany.
This work represents this border and, at the same time, it links the two countries with a sphere.
These links are woven to bring together people, peoples and continents.
Harada creates an integrated environmental sculpture at the dam inaugurated on October 19, 1995.
The work is composed of four types of red and pink granite.
The public has sometimes been confused by the originality of the form in this work.
Thus, as Yann Tholoniat has shown, it is a whole poetry based on orality.
What were the influences that could bring him to this genre?
1 of his chapter "The Vivid Voice" on this subject.
His public character, according to various testimonies, was very theatrical, with dandy-like looks, oratorical skills, a powerful voice.
Like Dickens, he practiced public reading of his works with a very impressive voice.
As its name indicates, polyphony is, according to Roland de Cand√©, "the simultaneous emission of several are of different heights".
The space is built first by the names of places, complements of place, objects.
It happens that these two forms of closed session alternate within the same poem ("Saul", "By the Fireside").
The time used in dramatic monologues is the present, sometimes reinforced by an adverb of time.
Thus, "The Laboratory" is framed by the same "now" (v. 1 and 45).
This dramatic moment concerns a crisis whose speaker is driven to speak "hic et nunc" compulsively.
To this Yann Tholoniat adds that the monologue "also weaves a network of temporalities in the speech of the speaker".
The whites and what is superimposed there, the typography and the punctuation, make stops, raises (mixed didascalie).
Known by his words alone, the director of his speech, Browning's speaker builds his own universe.
In this theater of communication, the reader is led to play a vital role.
International assistance can play a vital role in this initiative.
It is he, for example, on whom the poet counts to build the scenery, in cooperation with the speaker.
Without his prior culture, indeed, the monologue would remain an empty carcass.
no-valid-translation
Thus, in "My Last Duchess", the sending: "See this Neptune, however, / Taming a sea horse.
Exceptional piece, it is thought, / That Claus of Innsbruck sank in bronze for me!
This sculpture is thrown in the eyes of the allocutary and the reader as a comminatory reminder of Duke Ferrara's desire for omnipotence.
3 of his book (2009), gestures also participate in the elaboration of meaning.
Most often, they nuance, amplify or minimize speech, or express what they can not say.
/ Eh, I beg your pardon, here too, I advanced the reform ", (v. 1098-1099).
Yann Tholoniat indicates that Browning uses the parabola when "it seems to address the reader in the epilogues of the poems".
Thus "The Statue and the Bust", in which a coda challenges the reader: "" How strive you ".
From you, fabula "(" And where are you?
A poem like "Fra Lippo Lippi", in which the enshrined discourses proliferate, is a "tangle of prosopop√©es".
First, the monk gives himself to hear "as he thinks himself and as he wants to show himself".
The two men introduce each other: "Ah, do you know your masters?
[...] Yes, I am the painter, as you describe to me "(" Aha, you know your betters?
[‚Ä¶] Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so", v. 39).
So much so, writes Yann Tholoniat, that "the boundaries between the voices are blurred".
In truth, the list is long of rhetorical figures that Browning uses.
Critics often ask about Robert Browning's poetry: who is speaking in this work?
Would it also be the reader, implicitly solicited for the formulation of meaning?
Comme l'√©crit Yann Tholoniat, ¬´Browning the readers accused of a" auctoritas "who guide them in the hermeneutic processus¬ª.
This is a fundamentally ironic step that marks Browning's work, especially from "Pippa Passes" (1841).
What is irony (root: "Œµ·º∞œÅœâŒΩŒµŒØŒ±" ["eironeia"], which means "feigned ignorance")?
Yann Tholoniat has recorded these manifestations of Browningian irony in his Chapter 3 ("The Vivid Voice").
But Browning in 1855, while the poem appears, has long since abandoned the theater, which did not succeed.
The irony here is born of the incongruity of the request, spiced up by the wink of the poet to his discerning reader.
Browning truffles his poems with quotations sometimes claimed as such and sometimes hidden.
There is a philosophical, historical, literary, artistic, and musical erudition that only the encyclopedic reader can appreciate at a stroke.
E.-D. Forgues, in "Modern Poets and Novelists of Britain-Robert Browning", "Revue des deux Mondes" T.
12, 1847, states that Browning plays with his darkness in a calculated way.
Hence the difficulty of understanding the totality of meaning, its connotative ramifications, its geographic, temporal and cultural multiplication.
Be that as it may, the opacification of understanding by irony has contributed to this darkness generally attributed to Browning's work.
E.-D. Forgues, in his essay of 1847 gives the example of "Sordello".
In any case, and this is the important element, Browning thinks that it is necessary that the meaning resists.
In "Jochanan Hakkadosh" ("Jocoseria", 1883), he uses the metaphor of the nut.
To taste it, you have to make your way to it.
Mastiquez-en le sens, le spectacle, le chant ¬ª ("So with your meal, my poem: masticate/ Sense, sight and song there!")
In short, Browning, by his style devoid of nobility, revealed a spirit devoid of civilization.
In Browning, the intertextual network is, according to Yann Tholoniat, "as dense as encyclopedic".
Thus, this work constitutes in itself "a passionate dialogue" with the time.
"Balaustian's Adventure" (1871) includes a poem in honor of a painting by Frederic Leighton, "A Likeness".
In addition, this poem is full of references and allusions to Browning's ongoing debate with his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
Yann Tholoniat compares these echoes with harmonics that nourish the polyphony of speech.
In this case, its successive phases behave in movements similar to those of a musical work.
[...] By locking himself in the kiss, he can [the city] close to his sight.
Another recurring symbol, this tower or turret already present in the previous poem.
A tower also appears in Goito in "Sordello", but there, on the contrary, "the emphasis is on its harmlessness".
Sometimes these symbols are linked, the same referent, used by different characters, resurrecting the original metaphor.
Browning's style, in fact, feeds on the peculiarities of the language he chooses to exploit, the idiolect of his character.
His vocabulary favors words of Saxon origin, hence, often, their roughness, in itself descriptive of the speech.
It is a brute who walks here, for sure, who crushes their lives, with intentions of brute ").
Another preference of Browning, the words spoken language, "a priori" non-poetic, sometimes even slang.
To these two great constants are added mannerisms: archaisms, for example the recurrent interjection "Zooks!"
With "Aristophanes'Apology", as Bernard Brugi√®re writes, "[s] words fuse, crackle, frolic with more freedom than ever before.
On the formal level, if the articulation of the sentence is very clearly marked, its course remains rough, even chaotic.
("Like profusion and perfection of grass, / Never was!
[missing the "do" placed before the verb of the interrogative form], "Love Among the Ruins", stanza V).
Each monologue also presents a syntax adapted to the character, generally to a idiosyncratic trait well isolated.
¬ª ("What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down,/ You know them and they take you?
("Fra Lippo Lippi", verses 40-41), each sentence segment becoming an interrogation reduced to its simplest expression.
It happens also that the words are arranged according to the logic of an emotion aroused, in passing, by a fugitive perception.
Three thin silhouettes, / And a face that looks up ... What the hell!
Flesh and blood / That's what I'm doing!
Three slim shapes ",/"And a face that looked up "‚Ä¶"Zooks, flesh and blood "/"That's what I am made of!")
Word games require for their realization the sympathetic presence of an allocutary, either the fictitious allocator or the reader.
For a long time, Browning's punctuation has been ignored by critics, and even editors have given it negligible importance.
Nevertheless, this poet did not cease, until 1888, to correct his manuscripts.
Henri Meschonnic applies the term to punctuation and typography.
Let these poets be praised: they leave a margin;
Whether point, comma, hyphen or parentheses, their use is never free, but intended to manage the meaning.
The point sculpts the phrase, like "black and white in the musical field".
Variant of the point, the exclamation point is frequent and its position, also, strategic.
Most often located at incipit and sending, he "launches and [...] closes the poem".
Ainsi le premier vers de "Fra Lippo Lippi":"I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!
", et le dernier de "My Last Duchess", (vers 56): "Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!".
Similarly, the question mark, often theatrical as in some asides: "What is it in my ears?
It is not uncommon that it serves to condense and thus strengthen the impact of the formulation: "Fear death?
Commenting on the interrogation, Yann Tholoniat describes it as "rising" on "blame" "because of the punctuation mark".
"Have I ever interrupted them, those millions that seemed so little?
In this, they also participate "fully oral effects".
For all that, Browning's picturesque has, for the most part, nothing romantic about it.
Hence the exclamations, the hasty digressions, the asides, the answers to barely asked questions.
This picturesque, too, escapes ceaselessly towards the vision, the reality of which Browning is making signs.
In addition, even in the most serious poems, a touch of humor almost permanent.
It is manifested by a rhythm of percussion ("beat") in counterpoint to the poetic rhythm ".
Dans "The Last Ride Together", Browning expose sa conception de la versification, v. 67-71:
And so, side by side, you put them in step with rhyme.
The energy that ignores the canons of classical art is in nature as in Browning.
This idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa prose put in verse date of the same life Browning who deplored it.
"Did you see the Edinburg [sic] saying that all my poetry boils down to" Bang whang, whang, goes the Drum "?
He had written in 1864 during the review of "Up at the Villa Down in the City".
These diverse speakers and the plethora of subjects they deal with necessarily call for extremely varied versification patterns.
You say too many lies and you hurt yourself:
The poet, according to some testimonies, hammered the metric accents when he said one of his monologues, going up to beat them at the foot.
Thus, it happens to modify a diagram en route.
It serves first rhythmic accompaniment, so auditory, the visual image that emerges the poem.
/ "Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored", etc.).
In Book XII, as his poem comes to an end, Browning gives as a key to reading, v. 860-863:
So, note by note, that kind of your mind the music,
It is interesting to know that in verse 861, Browning first wrote "Beethoven" instead of "Andante".
The works quoted or used for the drafting of the article were classified in chronological order and grouped together.
Regardless of the anecdotal aspect, it is interesting to listen to a direct rendering of the rhythm by the author of the poem.
The works and articles used in writing the article are cited here.
Clubbing TV is an HDTV channel entirely dedicated to electronic music, DJ's and Dance Music culture.
The idea was born from the meeting of Dance Music professionals, International DJs, Promoters, Label Managers.
The channel is available on phones, tablets, internet, as well as in 27 countries via cable, DSL, satellite or OTT.
The use of the telephone has thus made a leap forward in poor countries.
He was pursued for his practice of medicine contrary to the teachings of the Sorbonne.
In 1577, he became familiar with the Duke of Merc≈ìur, one of the leaders of the leaguers.
Didier Khan the opportunism tax in his political and religious choices.
These choices of values ‚Äã‚Äãare political choices and they can not be left to the discretion of the technocrats.
In February 1578, he moved to Paris, on the bridge Saint-Michel.
Defended by Fran√ßois Chauvelin and Etienne Pasquier, Baillif eventually avoided any condemnation.
It was long believed that the Faculty had won.
It seems, however, that the prohibition against him was temporary.
In 1579, Baillif publishes for his defense his "Trailed summary apologic form of Defense".
In March, 1580, an epidemic of plague broke out in Paris.
The Baillif leaves Rennes in 1594, towards the moment of the entry of the king in Paris.
He also had a son named "Sainct Martin" and captain of a company.
In 1579, Ambroise Par√© removed from his works what could displease the Faculty.
But as early as 1580, Baillif's ideas were echoed by Jacques Fontaine.
This type of communication, which appeared in the 1980s, grew very rapidly in the mid-1990s.
Other countries have grown rapidly in recent decades, not counting external surpluses.
Technically performed in writing, this communication is considered as "oral communication in writing" or written, depending on the case.
There is no clear difference between spoken and written speech.
Then the text will be made available to readers from all walks of life, which the editor does not know.
Emphasis is provided by the tone of voice and non-verbal communication.
Phrases like "I tell you", "talk to me" and "talk" are commonplace.
Nonverbal communication is replaced by emoticons, thus giving the tone of comic, sarcastic or ironic speech.
The text includes puns, neologisms, onomatopoeia and slang, sometimes with exaggerated punctuation.
Depending on the case, e-mails can adopt a style of writing, or halfway between oral and written.
In the second case the style is spontaneous, bidirectional (questions and answers) contextual and allusive "Are you still coming tonight?
the film is at the Apollo at 8 pm, we find ourselves in front of the door? "
Unlike instant messaging, feedback is always a posteriori and the conversation takes place in the absence of the other.
The "netiquette" is a set of rules of politeness and courtesy usual in virtual communication.
Netiquette also talks about the spirit of cooperation, the length, clarity and relevance of the messages.
It can also sometimes lead to sanctions such as the exclusion of a community or the ban on writing.
The acronym "rtfm" was added to the "Oxford Dictionary of New Words" in 1997.
The interlocutors do not see each other and often do not know each other's face.
The use of pseudonyms, especially in instant messaging, gives the impression to individuals not to be "identifiable".
Verbal aggression is also more common because the responders have little risk of response in the form of physical aggression.
Private enterprise networks (Intranets), as well as BBSs also provide such services.
Computer tools such as wiki (collaborative writing), or online learning tools combine several services.
Instant messaging is a person-to-person text message dialogue service.
Sent messages are immediately sent to the recipient and are not retained.
Immediate transmission allows feedback, because responses are received during the conversation.
Windows Live Messenger and ICQ are computer tools that operate their own messaging service.
Each message sent by a subscriber is immediately readable by all subscribers.
Each subscriber can provide an answer to this message, and the answer will also be readable by all.
Distribution lists are a collective discussion mechanism that uses email.
The rules of conduct for Netiquette were created for the needs of the forums.
Email is a person-to-person communication service derived from the mail.
Each match is transmitted by a computer chain to the recipient's mailbox.
The World Wide Web is a mass media service, which allows the publication of hypertext documents.
Originally intended for scientific publication, it is now used for all kinds of documents.
A blog is a tool for creating documents sorted in chronological order.
It is used to publish diaries, unpublished journals, satires, or novels.
Spam are e-mail messages sent to subscribers against their will.
Spam can contain scams, pornography or cookies and is sent under a false identity.
A chain of letters is an email sent to someone, asking them to send that mail to others.
A flame, also called "troll", is a revolting message, often insulting, politically incorrect, and contrary to the rules of netiquette.
Filed on a forum, it can provoke an avalanche of aggressive responses, indicative of a conflict.
A moderator is a person who monitors the activity of the forums, and removes insulting or defamatory messages.
This has the effect of drowning the discussions and cause an increase in latency or even the cessation of services.
Rattan is a pale yellow thong used to make furniture.
An important distinction is to be emphasized between rattan bamboo and wicker.
The rattan stick consists of a set of fibers forming a solid cylinder and of regular diameter.
Bamboo is a plant with a cylindrical stem, hollow, woody and with prominent nodes.
While the wicker is a willow stem of slightly conical shape, and formed of a single fiber.
Ligations in straight or cross-threaded nets are made of other qualities of softer rattans such as Tohiti.
Rattan marrow is the inner part of the liana freed from its bark.
It is produced from long lengths of uniform size by mechanically passing them through dies.
Dull white-cream, it is very used in the manufacture of furniture of veranda or garden.
By its color and its luster, it is very reminiscent of bamboo.
The techniques used with rattan come from those used for wicker.
Rattan is both a flexible material for smaller diameters and rigid for larger thicknesses.
Indeed, it is resistant to traction but also to pressure.
Rattan qualities recommend it for decorative treatments such as stain or stain.
The following is the method to follow for making a rattan lanai piece.
The steam softens the fibers of the rattan's marrow, thus softening the room.
It can in this way tolerate its bending, manual and around a caliber of curvature.
Mechanical restraint is necessary, however, to prevent the piece from returning to its original shape.
For smaller diameters, simply soaking in cold water for 4 to 5 minutes allows them to bend.
The ligatures make it possible to hide the various elements of hardware in order to improve the aesthetic side of the seat.
In order to obtain a soft and smooth touch effect, the sanding of the furniture is mandatory.
In terms of finishing, all colors possible and imaginable are available.
The chosen shade is protected by an extra matt, matte or satin varnish according to the customer's wishes.
Dyeing and varnishing are done in a paint booth to avoid any environmental problems.
From a scientific point of view, the main problem is a lack of knowledge.
It is not necessary to apply a coat of post-finishing varnish against the dulling due to UV rays.
It is therefore essential to shelter during the bad season.
One of the biggest drawbacks of rattan is that it is difficult to innovate at the level of the structure.
Before being hired by the firm, the author claims to have been interviewed for work at the National Security Agency (NSA).
Perkins argues that a certain elite in the United States wants to build a global empire, defined by presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.
Because all these loans to lost funds would provoke the bankruptcy of any other creditor.
The United States can thus accumulate a huge national debt (at the beginning of 2003, $ 6 trillion).
At the end of 2008, the national debt of the United States and foreign investors accounted for about 40% of GDP.
Then, as a last resort, if the assassins also fail, American soldiers are sent to battle, following a strategy of classical imperialism.
Perkins opposes the ideology of Manifest Destiny to justify American expansionism.
For him, the elite working for the global empire is a mere combination of common interests and beliefs, not evil conspirators.
It is a question of justifying the indebtedness of a country by pretexting a future increase of the GNP.
The economic project resulting in the highest average annual growth in GNP had to outweigh the others.
Note of optimism, annual economic growth has remained at 5% in recent years.
Il peut cro√Ætre, also if the riches are enriched and the poor are getting out.
In September 2009, Osama bin Laden reportedly referred to the book in an audio recording.
IDRIS is based in Orsay (Essonne) on the campus of Paris-Sud University.
The operating methods of IDRIS are very close to those of very large scientific equipment.
The essential mission of IDRIS is to contribute to the acceleration of scientific discovery through the use of information technologies.
Information technology can also help reduce the pressure on transport systems.
IDRIS places several supercomputers at the disposal of the scientific community for public research:
Although this term is often used by the media, its definition remains incomplete.
The term "bubble" is often used but rarely specified.
For this reason, the Korn Group is also considered one of the pioneering groups of the NWOAHM.
Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation / Council and Commission (2008)
It was cited in UN Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333.
Subsequent Security Council resolutions and international treaties have confirmed this principle.
Others criticized what appeared to be a dualistic position of the Court.
None of the evidence on which these sanctions were based was made public.
Thus the regulation on the freezing of funds following the resolutions of the United Nations Council was modified.
no-valid-translation
Thus all the information must be disclosed to him and Mr Kadi can put forward all the evidence.
In a jurisdictional appeal framework, confidentiality can not be opposed.
The judge has a wide discretion to determine the facts to be taken into consideration ("CJEU, WIPO, 2008").
Iara Lee is a Brazilian director of Korean descent, born in 1966 in Brasilia.
In 2004, she and her husband, George Gund III, founded the San Francisco-based Iara Lee & George Gund Foundation.
Its activists were trying to break the Israeli blockade and bring international humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.
International humanitarian aid is hampered by the Sudanese government and its bureaucratic chinoiserie.
He is Prime Minister from 2009 to 2012 and Vice President from 2012 to 2016.
In 1990, Wu Den-yih was elected mayor of Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan.
Since 2007, Wu Den-yih is the general secretary of the KMT, the Chinese nationalist party.
Wu Den-yih is elected Vice President and takes office on May 20 following.
In November 2013, he openly criticizes China's restricted policy vis-√†-vis the visa exemption granted to international travelers.
National policies and complementary international agreements require careful scientific and economic analysis and thoughtful choices.
In December 2014, he announced his resignation from his position as Vice President of the KMT.
This monkey is endemic to the Fanjingshan Nature Reserve in the Wuling Mountains in Guizhou, China.
Its range has shrunk as a result of climate change after the last ice age.
In the era of climate change, several countries are demonstrating how to move to a low-carbon economy.
Other negative effects of climate change include possible decreases in agricultural harvests.
From these studies were extracted axioms to define what a topological space.
There are essentially two ways of presenting the usual topology of the set of real numbers:
Both rely on the construction of real numbers by completion of the set of rational numbers.
Moreover, it is totally ordered: of two given rational numbers, one is always inferior to the other.
These properties are compatible with each other, so for any three rational numbers "x", "y" and "a",
But Q is insufficient from the topological point of view, that is to say as regards the notions of limit and continuity.
It is necessary to supplement it with other numbers, called irrational numbers.
Among these are unavoidable numbers in science such as the square root of two and œÄ.
But the reciprocal is false: any sequence of Cauchy is not convergent.
It is so with the sequence defined by recurrence by the method of Heron:
Intuitively, it should tend to a number, but this number, the square root of two, is not a rational number.
Two suites of Cauchy are said to be equivalent when their difference tends to zero.
From its construction, several topological properties of the real line can be deduced:
The problem is that neither property rights nor markets can function autonomously.
Which means that any Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number.
Which means that any real number can be approached as close as we want by rational numbers.
The intuitive notion of limit is based on the intuition of "a sufficiently close number" of another.
A "neighborhood" of a real number "x" is the datum of all real numbers "close enough" to "x".
By convention the empty set is also considered an open of R. Two essential properties of open are that:
The topological properties of R can all be expressed in terms of open or neighborhood.
So, can the density of Q in R be written as follows:
"Any open non-empty of R contains at least one rational number."
"For every real number x, every neighborhood of x contains at least one rational number."
In other words, a property is true in the neighborhood of + ‚àû when it is true for all sufficiently large real numbers.
Given two realities, there is a neighborhood of one that does not contain the other.
It comes immediately the following properties, dual of those on the open ones:
An "overlap" of A is a family of sets whose union contains A.
The Borel-Lebesgue theorem indicates the equivalence between the two following properties, for every part K of R:
This second proposition is the definition of a compact set in general topology, for a separate space.
Intuitively, a compact part of R is a part that does not allow "leakage to infinity".
An interval of the form ["a"; "b" [or] "a"; "b"] is neither open nor closed.
The set obtained is bounded, because included in [0; 1], and closed as complementary to an open.
They are "very close" to A, as are all numbers of A: they belong to the adhesion of A.
The number 0.01 is "inside" of A, but not the number 0, although it belongs to A.
For example, the interior of the interval [0; 1 [is the interval] 0; 1 [.
The "adhesion" (sometimes called "closure") of A is made up of all the points adhering to A, it is denoted ƒÄ.
This is the smallest closed container A: all closed containing A contains ƒÄ.
For example, the adhesion of the interval [0; 1 [is the interval [0; 1].
For example, the boundary of the interval [0; 1 [consists of the numbers 0 and 1.
The criticisms generally formulated against the "shehita" present it as an inhuman and cruel mode of slaughter.
Currently, many of the "shehita" opponents are joining animal advocates to demand that the slaughter be preceded by stunning.
The technical rules of the shehita constitute a real specifications.
Any defect, even the size of a hair, makes the knife unusable.
Any error, any deviation from the ideal gesture that would cause the animal to suffer-disqualifies the "shehita".
Inspection: Immediately after the incision, the "shohet" examines the carcass and internal organs of the slaughtered animal.
This is an additional criterion requiring consideration of animal welfare.
The absence of movements of the beast may be due to paralysis without loss of consciousness.
Scientists have therefore used physiological, physicochemical and chemical criteria.
Subsequently, in 4 to 10 seconds after the "shehita", a state of unconsciousness is detected at the EEG.
On the contrary, during slaughter after stunning, the flat EEG is only reached more slowly.
This difference is explained by the effects of shehita on the body, which have been studied by physiologists.
The commonly used slaughtering methods in Europe (other than "shehita") involve "stunning" the animal before the incision.
"Stun" with a stab gun involves puncturing the cranial box of cattle with a metal rod.
The success of the operation depends on the point of impact, the angle used and therefore the dexterity of the technician performing this task.
Because of the rates of chain slaughter, failures can be frequent (up to 7% failures).
In these cases, the animal will perceive everything, will suffer, will be conscious, but will not be able to move.
One of the essential factors for the success of the operation is the training of qualified personnel.
On 16 June 2010, the European Parliament voted an amendment in the draft regulation on labeling.
Meat from ritually slaughtered animals will be subject to special negative labeling.
This labeling will mean that these meats will no longer enter traditional distribution channels.
In the short term, it can be expected that believers will no longer be able to acquire meat from ritually slaughtered animals in Europe.
They are probably negative in the short term, but who can predict them in the longer term?
The consumer will have the opportunity to choose freely and with full knowledge of the facts.
These seeps occur at the sea floor, or sometimes on the sides of a seamount.
They are sometimes associated with a local accumulation (small-lake) of very saline and very dense water (brine).
Cold seeps are both a habitat and an ecosystem of "extreme environment".
These species and systems are of great interest to soil remediation specialists.
In addition, methane is sometimes abundant in cold fluids.
Some bacteria in cold seeps are able to degrade this methane.
Finally, there are many species, often endemic and still unknown to science before the 1960-1970s.
Underwater "mofettes" can also be found in areas of submarine volcanoes and adjoin hot springs.
Several areas of this type are the subject of specialist attention.
On the continental margins of America, this is the case of the Gulf of Mexico.
The tubeworms were found on eighteen of these twenty-one sites.
Clams were found at twelve of these twenty-one sites and mussels at five of these sites.
Carbon isotope analysis of the tissues of these animals confirmed the chemo-synthetic association (for the twenty-one sites).
Core samples showed for each of these sites the actual presence of hydrocarbons.
On the margins of the African continent, the Gulf of Guinea interests specialists for similar reasons.
Ikaite, a hydrated calcium carbonate, may be associated with the oxidation of methane from these cold seeps.
A large community of heterotrophic species is built on each cold seepage if it is sustainable enough.
(1990) described four main types of community, depending on whether they are dominated by:
Bacterial biofilms are present on all sites visited to date.
Forming aggregates of several thousand individuals, sometimes giant, they are the most visible organisms.
They seem to play a vital role in the communities that form around cold seeps.
The international community has a role to play, but national authorities must act.
The "tufts" of worms are home to more than a hundred other species.
Around cold springs, the growth of tubeworms is much slower than it is around hot springs.
But on the other hand, they seem to live much older, and sometimes become up to three times larger:
In addition, recruitment (that is, the arrival of new individuals in the colony) also seems random or episodic.
Isotopic analyzes suggest that it feeds on the periodic release of eggs (oophagy) from tubeworm females.
The growth rate of methanotrophic mussels living on cold seeps was studied in the 1990s.
Individuals, such as communities, seem to be characterized by a very long life span.
It has been shown that these molds need a hard substrate where they fix their byssus.
This phenomenon seems much less important on cold seeps and especially for clams.
Powell estimated that in 50 years, local extinctions and recolonization should be gradual and extremely rare.
These bacterial biofilms cover the surface of the sediment, and sometimes structures closer to the vertical.
Free bacteria can also be found in suspension in the medium, or in the sediment.
Biofilms have been found at all oily hydrocarbon sites.
Conversely, orange carpets appear to be produced by bacteria with poorly identified but non-chemosynthetic metabolism (MacDonald, 1998b).
The flesh of Beggiatoa is isotopically depleted in carbon 13 (Œ¥13C = -27.9 ‚Ä∞ PDB).
Carrots taken from the filamentous bacterial mats confirmed its high hydrocarbon content (up to 50% crude oil).
However, the meiofauna community structure varies very much in and out of the bacterial mats.
For example, Harpacticoids accounted for 19% of wildlife outside carpets, but only about 1% indoors.
The pigment concentrations were comparable in and out of the carpets.
Large fields of dead clam shells may suggest this, at least for this species.
But the geological antiquity of these systems is attested by fossils.
A tailor has three sons and a single goat who feeds them all with his milk.
The goat must therefore be well treated, and the sons take turns every day to take him to graze.
The eldest son leads her to the edge of the cemetery, where the grass is very tender.
At the end of the day, he asks the goat if it is well sated.
The goat says yes and they are going home.
We will answer these questions with yes, yes, yes and yes.
Back at home, the goat, however, told the tailor that she had nothing to eat.
The next day, the second son takes the goat along a hedge, because the grass is very tender.
At the end of the day, he asks the goat if she has eaten well.
The goat expresses his satisfaction and they go home.
Then, the tailor hunts his second son in the same way as the first.
The father, then, realizes that he committed an injustice in chasing his three sons.
To punish the animal, he shaves his head, and flogging.
", Garnish a tablecloth with all the necessary cutlery, tantalizing dishes and a large glass of wine.
Before that, he goes through an inn in which, recklessly, he shows the properties of his table.
The innkeeper takes advantage of the night to exchange the small table against another, which looks like him but nothing magical.
Later, the young man arrives at his father's house and wants to show his table to the whole family.
When he orders the table "Small table be put!
As nothing happens, he realizes the trickery.
The young man travels the world then decides to return to his father.
He passes by the same inn as his elder, and the innkeeper exchanges his donkey against another.
The father apologizes to the family, and the son goes to serve another master miller.
He receives a letter from his brothers telling him what happened at the innkeeper's.
", Pops up and hits the ill-intentioned person until she asks for grace.
Then just say "Gourdin, in the bag!
The young man arrives thus in the inn where his two brothers were rolled.
At night, he goes to the room of the young man to steal the bag.
The young man brings up the club, which hurls the thief.
The latter finally promises to restore the little table and the donkey, and the young man makes the club disappear.
The next morning, the young man returns to his father's house with table, donkey and club.
The donkey produces a shower of gold and the table offers them a treat as they never knew.
The goat, at the origin of all the history, ashamed of her bald head, hid in the burrow of a fox.
The fox, returning home, sees two eyes sparkle in the darkness, scares and flees.
The bee enters the burrow and bites the goat twice on its bald head.
The goat, screaming, then rushes out of the hole, and no one knows what it has become after that.
The beginning of the story is of type AT 212, "The Lying Goat."
The constituency of Warringah is an Australian constituency in New South Wales.
It is located by the sea north of Sydney city center.
It includes the neighborhoods of Mosman, Balgowlah, Manly, Brookvale, Beacon Hill and Forestville.
His current MP is Tony Abbott, the leader of the party and the prime minister of Australia since 2013.
Nobody knows if the current prime ministers of the Europe of 27 will choose Blair.
The decomposition process involves a succession of micro-organisms such as fungi and bacteria, most often anaerobic.
In other words, it is the degradation of organic molecules by the action of microorganisms.
Their corpses were decomposed by giving source to bacteria and microinvertebrates that will be the food of fry.
They were so numerous that necrophagous species could consume only a small part of them).
More familiarly, the verb "decompose" is replaced by "rot".
Example: "a fruit in a state of advanced decomposition" would be replaced by "rotten fruit".
In plant pathology, decay follows a cryptogamic or bacterial plant disease.
In the aquarium industry, fin rot refers to a condition caused by bacteria ("Aeromonas" or "Pseudomonas") or by mycobacteria ("Mycobacteriaceae").
Environmental pollution affects the natural processes of decomposition and therefore the carbon cycle and other elements.
Emissions and natural processes that increase atmospheric carbon are known as "flux".
BƒÉtarci is part of the micro-region of the country Oas established in 2006 around the city of Negre≈üti-Oa≈ü.
It is a region that is part of a country we share with the Palestinians.
The municipality is composed of the following four villages (population in 2002):
The village of TƒÉm≈üeni is mentioned as early as 1323 under the name "warallya".
Various objects dating from the Bronze Age have been discovered on the municipal territory: spears, bracelets, gold rings.
BƒÉtarci joins the Ugocsa County ("Ugocsa v√°rmegye") whose chief town was the city of Vynohradiv, nowadays in Ukraine.
Between 1905 and 1910, 58 German families from Galicia settled in the village.
She returned to Romania after the Second World War to the Treaty of Paris in 1947.
The BƒÉtarci Municipal Council has 13 municipal councilors' seats.
Following the June 2008 municipal elections, Ion Grigora≈ü (PSD) was elected mayor of the municipality.
In 2002, the religious composition of the municipality was as follows:
The economy of the town is based on agriculture, livestock and forestry.
A high quality plum brandy, the palinka, is produced in the village.
The hymn, "Djelem, djelem", was written by ≈Ωarko Jovanoviƒá on a popular gypsy song.
This notion of "rom" in the narrow sense is also used by the Larousse website.
An equally undemonstrable hypothesis assumes that the word "Rom" derives from the name of the God "Rama" (name of Avatar of Vishnu).
At different times, the French language has produced different terms that evoke either subsets or the totality of Roma populations:
Many poetic tales of the oral tradition circulate about the origin of the Roma and are part of their traditions.
With the Golden Horde and Tamerlane, the Roma thus reached Europe, Anatolia and the gates of Egypt.
Towards the south they cross in 1425 the Pyrenees and penetrate in what will become Spain in 1479.
It is unclear whether Roma have ever passed through North Africa, as some people think.
The Empire is crossed by Western pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.
These travelers then call them Egyptians (Egitanos, Gitanos, Gypsies, Egypies, Gypsies).
In the summer of 1419, the tribes appeared on the territory of present-day France in Chatillon-sur-Chalaronne, in Bresse, in Macon, in Sisteron.
The rumor also lends them magic tricks during which the purse of passers-by is emptied.
The bishop of Paris reacts by going there with a minor brother who preaches and convinces the group to leave.
Recalcitrants are imprisoned, mutilated, sent to galleys or colonies, and even executed.
They practice all kinds of trades: street vendors, fairground, blacksmiths, blacksmiths, tinkers, woodcutters, horse dealers, gravediggers, ragpickers, acrobats, musicians.
They offer some training and butler positions, accountants or teachers for their children.
"Robs" can be donated, bequeathed or sold at auction.
Enlightenment philosophers were not particularly tender with the Bohemians, with the possible exception of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
But the maritime war prevented the execution of this project and they were gradually released.
The detention of the arrested persons extends over a period of 3 years.
After this episode, "all returned to their mountains," says Adolphe Mazure.
In Hungary, they are given land and animals, which they sell immediately to their neighbors to get back on the road.
In 1825, in Moldavia, Hospodar Ioni≈£ƒÉ Sandu Sturza untied Roma from their ties to monasteries and boyars.
This official act is part of a good intention: to end the "robie".
But in practice, this leaves the Roma unprotected in the face of sedentary farmers who demand agrarian reforms.
Many Roma then resumed nomadism, while they were settled mostly around seigniorial domains (konaks) and abbey.
In any case, Sturdza was overthrown in 1828 and the "robie" was immediately restored.
But these laws are questioned between 1940 and 1944.
In Switzerland, the Federal Department of Justice and Police plans in 1930 the kidnapping of children over ten years.
The Pro-Juventute Foundation has already implemented the "Children of the Grand Route" operation in 1926.
Dr. Alfred Siegfried, director of the "Children of the Great Road" considers the Yenish as "genetically liars and thieves".
Gypsies also participated in armed resistance in France, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland and the USSR.
The Romanian government officially recognized this genocide (along with the Holocaust) in 2005.
In the northern zone the Germans are at the origin of the internment of the nomads.
Only 12 Belgian or French people survived on the 351 convoys from Mechelen to Auschwitz.
There are also some known cases, not exhaustive, of French Gypsies deported as resistant.
Some take refuge in the cave of Eaux-Claires in My Campaign.
However, a small number of people gained the status of "political internee" long after the war.
In 1988, a modest commemorative stele was erected on the Montreuil-Bellay internment site.
The vestiges of this camp are the subject of an inscription with the Historic Monuments on July 8, 2010.
A monument, the work of the sculpteur Jean-Claude Guerri, was inaugurated at the site of the Saliers camp on 2 February 2006.
The World Roma Congress, meeting in Geneva in 1978, creates the International Romani Union which has consultative status with the UN.
With 10 to 12 million people, Roma are the largest ethnic minority in Europe.
Romanian statistics only recognize half a million Roma, while they estimate their number between 0.5 and 1 million.
In 2000, an international Roma parliament, based in Vienna, was created.
Spain is the country of Western Europe that hosts the largest community of Roma.
It is also one of the few to have given it the status of national minority.
Most of them immigrated in the 1990s, shortly after the fall of Communist dictatorships.
On 9 September 2010, the European Parliament called for the suspension of these forced returns, contrary to Community law.
In May 2008, in Italy, near Naples, Roma camps were burned.
According to this survey, this is not a begging organized criminally.
Faced with an influx of Roma from Kosovo, the country has made some expulsions.
Only 2% of Roma have a liberal profession or are managers.
61% of Roma surveyed were unemployed.
Smaller groups live in Western and Northern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

In the Middle East and North Africa, one in three young people are unemployed.
A dozen countries in the Middle East and North Africa are planning to build nuclear power plants.
Throughout the Middle East and North Africa, Islamist parties are ascending.
Roma are also numerous in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
In 1971, the Congress of Roma Movements and Associations adopted the Roma flag as a symbol of the Roma people.
The "Gypsy World Congress" held in London on April 8, 1971 chose this date to commemorate the International Roma Day.
Gypsies, for example, are most often spoken in Hispanic dialects, like cal√≥.
The kinship of the Romani ensemble with Sanskrit is clearly established, with avestic and Hebrew influences.
Roma also speak the dominant language of the region in which they live, or even several languages.
In Slovakia, many Roma speak both Romani, Slovak and Hungarian.
The linguistic borrowing of Romani makes it possible to follow their migration to the West.
In Spain, they influenced flamenco and they became the protagonists of this genre.
In Romania they are called "lƒÉutari", in the Czech Republic and Slovakia "lavutari".
The guitarist Django Reinhardt, meanwhile, will have a lasting influence on jazz by mixing gypsy music.
Gus Viseur and Tony Murena, composers of famous waltz musette, played and were influenced by gypsy musicians.
The theater was also a traditional artistic activity of the Gypsy population.
Today, it is represented only by the Djungalo Teatro, one of the very rare theaters of Gypsy tradition in Europe.
At the same time guitarist and singer, he creates certain styles of this music which seguiriya.
Between 1930 and 1940, flamenco gave way to flamenco opera, denounced for its decadent and commercial character.
Camaron de la Isla was the main star of the flamenco cante from the 1970s to the 1990s.
The pianist Georges Cziffra was renowned for his great virtuosity, his extremely varied repertoire and his improvising talents.
Those in Western Europe or the United States are either Catholic or Protestant.
In Latin America, many have kept their European religion: most are Orthodox.
In Turkey, Egypt and the southern Balkans, they are often Muslim.
Even when Gypsies join a particular religion over the centuries, they do not forget their origins.
The main one, common among people who have suffered rejections and deportations, is the hope of one day being united.
However, Hinduism, distant, remains very little known, and this movement is strongly minority.
This tradition is shared with the Aromanians, as well as with Romanians but also other Balkan populations.
Under the Ancien R√©gime, Gypsies made pilgrimages to Mont Saint-Michel and Alise-Sainte-Reine.
The origin of the pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in the Camargue, which is the occasion of a great annual gathering, pious and festive, is not precisely known.
An image of "The Illustration" of 1852 shows a "Bohemian" placing her child on the shrine of the Maries.
Both processions will be prohibited during the Vichy regime.
The Spanish gypsy Ceferino Gim√©nez Malla is beatified on May 4, 1997 by John Paul II.
In some countries, the majority of Roma now belong to Roma churches.
This unforeseen change has greatly contributed to the improvement of their image in society.
Evangelical Roma churches exist today in every country where Roma have settled.
He was called "the Apostle of the Gypsies" by the Roma people.
Other important and numerous assemblies exist in Los Angeles, Houston, Buenos Aires and Mexico.
Some groups from Romania and Chile have joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

"Mulengro", a novel by Canadian contemporary fiction writer Charles de Lint, presents a portrait of the Rom and his cultural myths.
Bohemia is a literary and artistic theme derived from the various stereotypes about "Bohemians".
Among the works of French popular literature contributing to transmit stereotypes about the Roman world, we can mention the songs.
The same stereotypes as in the novel or opera are used.
The Mobile and Ohio Railroad was conceived as a cure for the Panic of 1837.
The first section between Mobile and Citronelle was opened in 1852.
The civil war came shortly after the completion of the line which was assigned to military use.
At the same time, money earmarked for the war could have been spent on something else.
During the fighting she was a military target for both sides.
He was placed in receivership in 1875 and did not leave until 8 years later.
The future will be converted to the standard standard for permettre de relier Mobile in Saint-Louis, Missouri.
In 1896, the company decided to build a line between Columbus, Mississippi and Florida.
On June 30, 1898, the Tuscaloosa-Montgomery line, Alabama was opened, as well as two small branches.
The M & O was again placed in receivership on June 3, 1932.
The Southern was accused of using the M & O for his benefit, but the case was dropped in 1933.
It is an indication of the politicization of women during the American Revolution.
The latter seized the means of action which the laws of the genus designated as suitable to their sex.
The boycott, an activity compatible with the domestic activity of middle-class women, was one of them.
The domestic market and the growing middle class will gain more importance.
"Perhaps only the men have shown their protest to the king so far.
It only means that we women have waited too long to let our voices be heard.
Before any activity of this type, both partners must first consent.
The other type of crisis that most of these partner countries are facing is political.
The "bondage" even used as punishment remains bondage, only it is also part of the discipline.
The rules can be applied in some way by the dominant as a tool to disorient the submissive partner.
A sadistic partner can also use them as a pretext for punishment.
Its unit of account is bitcoin, limited to 21 million units and divisible up to the eighth decimal place.
All transactions are verified by the network nodes and recorded in a tamper-proof public registry called "blockchain".
Bitcoin is the largest decentralized cryptographic currency with a capitalization close to 10 billion euros in 2016.
Bitcoins are created according to the source code of the software, as payment for transaction processing.
Bitcoins can then be exchanged for other currencies, goods or services.
Cryptocurrency has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies of various countries including the United States and the media.
The US Senate also recognizes that bitcoin can provide perfectly legitimate financial services.
The corresponding acronyms used by the exchange platforms are "BTC" and "XBT".
Unofficial symbols used include "‡∏ø" and "…É".
In b-money, the servers were supposed to deposit a security deposit in an unclear mechanism.
Satoshi Nakamoto said he worked on Bitcoin from 2007 to 2009.
In 2008, he published a document on a mailing list describing Bitcoin digital currency.
With other developers, Nakamoto continues the implementation of the software and its "Bitcoin-Qt" version until 2010.
Developers and the Bitcoin community are gradually losing touch with Satoshi Nakamoto in mid-2010.
The operators of the nodes of the network can during an alert either to warn their users, or to stop any recording of transaction.
There was no trace of his identity before the creation of Bitcoin.
On his profile, he claimed to be a 40-year-old Japanese.
In 2016, Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
In September 2016, more than 770 of these ATMs are installed worldwide, including 4 in France.
The course had been multiplied by eight in less than five weeks.
He is the alleged founder of Silk Road, which is closed by the FBI.
A crisis management document has been drafted and is publicly available.
Bitcoin would have lost more than 38% of its value in the first quarter of 2014.
He is suspected of misappropriating 2.3 million euros of bitcoin deposits.
In May 2016, the exchange site Gatecoin, is hacked by being stolen 250 bitcoins and 185,000 ether.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency while Bitcoin is a payment system in this currency.
In both respects, Bitcoin differs from pre-existing systems in the following areas:
All national currencies experience low to high inflation according to the policies of their central bank.
The political pressure on the European Central Bank may explain the modesty of this measure.
If such policies are put in place, central banks can afford to relax monetary policy.
In addition, bitcoins lost by users will never be overwritten.
This software provides the issuance of money according to a mathematical rule (type geometric series).
Any differences between these copies must be resolved by the access software.
These different functions are realized by software available as free software.
The user of each node can freely choose the functions that he will assume in the system and the software that he uses.
The construction and maintenance of the blockchain is performed by the computers located at the nodes of a network.
Bitcoin does not exist independently outside the Bitcoin payment system.
A transaction involves debiting certain accounts to credit other accounts.
It consists of a number of inputs and a number of outputs.
When validating a transaction, the scripts of each entry are executed, in the order of exit script and then input script.
the transaction is validated only if the result is "true" for all entries.
These scripts are written in an internal language designed by Nakamoto.
This language is deliberately minimalist and not Turing-complete, in particular to prevent the system from engaging in infinite loops.
Each new confirmation further strengthens the validity of the transaction in the transaction log.
Each user can have any number of accounts, which he asks for the creation to his "wallet".
Each Bitcoin account is associated with a private key-public key pair.
An account is identified by a number made from a 160-bit cryptographic fingerprint of its public key.
Here is an example of a Bitcoin address, this is the first address to receive bitcoins: codice_1
The private key, used to sign this transaction, must match the public key that has previously received bitcoins.
The information contained in the wallet of a user is critical and must be strictly protected against any intrusion.
His bitcoins are definitely lost and will stay forever in the base without ever being able to change their address.
It is this creation of money which explains the use of the term "mining", by analogy with the exploitation of the gold mines.
Within a block, transactions are stored as a Merkle tree.
One can therefore find a suitable nuncio only by successive trials.
In 2016, a dozen of these cooperatives provide 95% of the blocks.
The rewards for mining activities have led to the development of ever more specialized technologies.
The most efficient hardware uses integrated circuits that outperform general purpose processors while using less power.
The Bitcoin system blockchain is a public book that records transactions.
It exists in a large number of copies managed independently by the nodes of the network, none of which plays a privileged role.
These decisions being totally decentralized, it is impossible to know the number of nodes of each type.
Network nodes are likely in tens of thousands.
It is even possible that they spread locally through contagion or connivance.
Recall that each block contains the identifier of its predecessor in the block chain of its minor.
The block in question is rebroadcast to neighboring nodes, and thus gradually to the entire network.
In case of failure, the block is kept on hold, by joining a secondary branch of the block chain.
If the node receives a new block that contains a script already present in the local string, that block is rejected.
On each node, it is therefore the first valid block received that will be registered in its chain of blocks.
Blocks built by other miners in the same 10-minute cycle will be rejected.
To this end, the header of each block contains the difficulty of the work that was done to build it.
The private key, used to sign this transaction, must match the public key that has previously received bitcoins.
The user must store all these private keys, without of course sharing this information.
At no time does the system ensure the confidentiality and encryption of data transmitted over the network.
Transaction signatures are performed using elliptic curve cryptography, known as ECDSA.
Cryptography is only used to create non-falsifiable signatures and implement one-way functions.
The symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC, XBT, and "".
The Unicode consortium, after a proposed addition, agreed in November 2015 to add the bitcoin in its characters.
The transfer of bitcoins is also possible using the private key.
Without the knowledge of the private key, the transaction can not be signed preventing bitcoins from being spent.
The user will accumulate as and when payments will receive a collection of different amounts (called input data).
The more a user pays a high transaction fee, the faster their transaction will be processed.
In case of identical charges, priority is given to the oldest transactions.
Below a certain quotient, the transaction requires the payment of fees to be processed immediately.
The user is the only one to decide the amount of transaction fees he is willing to pay.
Creating a new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins.
The Bitcoin protocol uses addresses that indicate on the public register searchable by all the amount in bitcoins associated.
All transactions on the block chain are also public and searchable by all.
The latter can then exchange their positions against other crypto-currencies or currencies.
The brokerage fees are generally very low and the users must produce a proof of their identity.
The platforms must have authorization in France to carry out buy / sell operations in bitcoins against euros.
There are also vending machines that charge a commission for the transaction.
Some platforms offer the opportunity to buy or sell short cryptocurrency, or to use leverage.
Complex financial instruments are developing such as CFDs and investment funds.
Bitcoin, mainly traded in yuan and dollar, is also traded in euros on a dozen platforms.
As a result of the problems encountered by this platform, the users are turning away, causing a sudden fall in the price on Mt.
Gox and affecting only little the prices observed on the other platforms.
February 19, 2014, the bitcoin price collapses following the announced disappearance of bitcoins on Mt.
However, this diversity stimulates the possibilities of legal answers, which, for the time being, are hardly fixed, let alone convergent.
Thus, the European Banking Authority issued a warning to consumers against the risks of "bitcoin" (13 December 2013).
France has not yet clearly defined the nature and the legal regime of "bitcoin".
In this case, the rules in force for electronic money would be applicable to "bitcoin" (Articles L.
This situation was recalled by the tax authorities on July 11, 2014.
The Banque de France first warned of the risks of "bitcoin".
Senator Tom Carper's parliamentary report (February 3, 2014) provides a first overview of the legal issues surrounding "bitcoin".
No restrictions exist for the holding and exchange of bitcoins between individuals.
On the other hand, financial institutions and banks are prohibited from carrying out any transaction related to bitcoin.
From the beginning, Bitcoin has been the subject of many discussions, technical as well as economic or even political.
I had intense economic policy discussions with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa.
From these discussions, a number of advantages and disadvantages were discussed.

The water clock at Borugak Pavilion is a water clock from Korea.
Dating back to the Joseon period, it is preserved in Seoul, South Korea.
During the same period, South Korea had 10 different presidents and the USA 11.
Not being sufficiently preserved, it was rebuilt and improved in 1536 by Yu Jeon by order of King Jongjong.
In 1560, following the death of Louis de Sionnaz, without posterity, his sister, Fran√ßoise (1522-1611) inherited the lordship.
She is the wife of Fran√ßois de Sales, Baron of Thorens, and will have for son the future Saint Francis de Sales.
The house becomes the usual residence of the family from 1590.
The castle thus passes to the family of Sales who remains owner of the castle until the French Revolution.
The book "History of the Savoyard communes" indicates that the strong house is ruined in 1593.
In addition, the "Sardinian Mappe" of 1730 indicates in No. 1655 the mention "House of the Marquis de Sales".
The property is sold in 1922 and the mansion becomes a hotel.
Georges Dangon will be mayor of the town from 1929 to 1947, then again from 1953 until his death in 1956.
Receptions are held in the castle garden for locals or national political or artistic personalities.
It is not too late, policy makers at national and international level can still reconsider their strategy.
The political variations at the national level can not alone justify the variations noted by Gianetti and Simonov.

The National Museum of Korea is the main museum of art and history in South Korea.
In October 2005, the museum moved into a new building in Yongsan Family Park in Seoul.
In 1908, Emperor Sunjong founded the first museum in Korea, the Imperial Museum, during the last years of the Joseon Dynasty.
Upon their return, the museum was housed at the Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung palaces.
In 1972, a new building was built near Gyeongbokgung Palace.
This choice was the source of endless criticism and controversy.
Eventually, the government decided to demolish the building and started a new construction project at Yongsan Family Park.
The first prize was won by Kim Chang-il from Junglim.
Meanwhile, the museum was temporarily reopened to the public in the hall of social education.
The National Museum joined its current location in 2005, the official inauguration was held on October 28, 2005.
The Yongsan complex is an impressive size: 45,438 m¬≤ on the ground and 307,227 m¬≤ useful.

He has been one of the longest term of the histoire des Cara√Øbes.
He was also Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1984 to 1992.
At the same time, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing was in Tokyo.
He wrote an autobiography, "Beyond The Islands", released in 2006.
Tax Conservative, he is known to ardently defend the control of the expenses and the increase of the tax on the consumption.
By his father, he is the grandson of the poets Tekkan and Akiko Yosano.
His childhood is spent according to the assignments of his father.
He lived his first four years, from 1938 to 1942, in Beijing.
From December 1952 to March 1956, his father was Minister Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and then Japan's first ambassador to Egypt.
The Yosano family settles in Cairo, and Kaoru Yosano is enrolled in the English school of Heliopolis.
He plans a time to continue his studies at Oxford University in the UK, goes to London and passes the entrance exam.
But he eventually changed his mind and returned to Japan in early 1957.
He is also interested in baseball, serving as a manager in the university team.
According to Yosano, it is this episode that makes him want to engage in politics upon his return to Japan.
Kaoru Yosano is a passionate and experienced player of the game of go.
Kaoru Yosano resigned from JAPC in 1968 to become a collaborator of Yasuhiro Nakasone.
This constituency sends at that time three deputies elected to the single non-transferable vote.
The opposition parties (especially the PSJ, the PDS and the "K≈çmeit≈ç", but also the CPJ) are well established.
However, he has only a few months to wait before he can try his luck again.
Thus, for the second time in his career, Kaoru Yosano must leave the Diet.
This is international trade, industry or science.
C'est Nakasone who offered Yosano to the premiere governmental exp√©rience, sans in faire tooufois, even a minister of the member state of the Cabinet.
As a result of these two setbacks, Ry≈´tar≈ç Hashimoto resigned from the party presidency and the post of prime minister.
Kaoru Yosano loses his seat in the House of Representatives in 2000.
Despite his forced departure from the Diet, Kaoru Yosano remains an influential political figure known to the general public.
The deteriorating financial situation will also hit the economy. "
The deteriorating financial situation of families has also deprived poor children of any education.
Yosano is appointed Minister of State for Economic, Financial and Tax Policy.
He is also responsible for overseeing the restructuring of the eight financial institutions affiliated with the government engaged by the Koizumi administration.
What the post-Koizumi administration will need, however, is architectural design and construction. "
However, this reworked government is again affected by a scandal and does not stay long in place.
He failed, however, to gather behind him all the pro-Koizumi reformers, who had fun in three applications.
We are seeing clear signs that the global financial crisis is also affecting the economies of the BRICs.
Before the recent global financial crisis, the SDR accounted for only 0.5% of international reserves.
Since the global financial crisis of 2008, a lot of new rules have been put in place.
After all, the global financial crisis has seriously damaged the credibility of rating agencies as a whole.
And it was only in the 1930s that the economy emerged from a major financial crisis.
The global financial crisis has dramatically shaken the international financial architecture, taking many institutions by surprise.
A new global financial crisis could quickly disrupt the flow of capital it attracts.
Six years after the beginning of the global financial crisis, many begin to ask uncomfortable questions.
The global financial crisis has exposed the underlying weaknesses of the euro area.
In addition, the global financial crisis has created new puzzles.
CAMBRIDGE - Does the extension of the global financial crisis mark the end of financial triumphalism?
BUENOS AIRES - The global financial crisis raises fundamental questions about the mandate of central banks.
BERKELEY - The global financial crisis has resurrected the old debate about the impending end of the euro.
With the global financial crisis and the sudden slowdown in the economy, two things are becoming clear.
As the IMF predicts, global economic growth must become negative and Japan is no exception.
Despite these exceptional expenses, Kaoru Yosano remains a strong supporter of meeting the target of a budget surplus by 2011.
But several participants in this rebellion are gradually withdrawing their support, causing the move to fail on 17 July.
According to him, "the finances would collapse" if the opposition came to power.
Time is running out and I will probably make a decision in the near future. "
Kaoru Yosano becomes co-chair, along with Takeo Hiranuma.
They are soon joined by three other former ministers or collaborators of Koizumi.
Thus, he cites among its main objectives: "the defeat of the DPJ".
"Tachiagare Nippon" has a mixed result in the polls in the upper house.
It remains however without label, not adhering therefore to the Democratic Party.
I appointed Mr. Yosano to raise the public debate on this issue. "
But his entry into government is not unanimous, both in the opposition and in the majority.
[...] It is shameful for a politician to give up his allegiance to become a cabinet minister. "
The owners and the NBA on one side and the players on the other side are at a dead end in their contract negotiations.
In the absence of positive results in the negotiations, the NBA cancels the first games of the season.
On November 26, the two parties announced that they had reached an agreement in principle and thus put an end to the lockout.
The Peronist party failed to agree on a single candidate.
The regular season begins at Christmas, with a schedule reduced to 66 games instead of the usual 82.
The lockout was the fourth stoppage in NBA history.
The NBA then launches a revised version of the 2011-2012 season.
The league has built a new calendar from the available dates of the halls.
Normally, each team plays twice each team of the other conference.
The set of three matches, or "triple", has not occurred since the shortened 1999 season, which featured 64 "triples".
The division champions are automatically qualified for the playoffs, as well as the top five franchises of each conference.
The former hospital of Montbeliard is a former medical center located in the heart of the old town of Montbeliard in the Doubs.
The different medical centers and hospitals install systems that are incompatible and can not communicate with each other.
In 1249, Thierry III de Montb√©liard founded a hospital at the locality of the prairie of the sting, outside the city.
In 1450, because of looting and wars, the hospital moved to the interior of the city on St. Martin's Square.
For this purpose, a rector is appointed by the magistrates to report on the management of the hospital.
In 1782, the hospital receives from the Russian tsar visiting the city, a gift of 100 Louis of gold.
Between 1852 and 1857, the building of baths is built, probably by the architect Jean Fr√©d√©ric Fallot.
In 1897, the hospital was decommissioned and part was destroyed in 1902.
The buildings housed until 1987 the municipal library and then local associations.
The building has a limestone basement and the galleries were made of wood.
On the front door, a stone bearing the date "" 1761 "" reminds the date of construction.
Then he enrolled in the law school of Coimbra, where he formed with a group of friends the "generation 70".
Concerned about his fragile health, he organizes the edition of his stories which will be presented posthumously.
Quote attributed: "The truth is the law of a single interpretation".
The only law that Congress can not repeal is the law of unintended consequences.
The flowery parade of Saumur comes from a tradition of festive parades, practiced irregularly since 1803.
One of the oldest information concerns the flower parade of 1897.
The cavalcade was to take place on March 14, it was canceled and postponed to the 21st because of heavy rains.
February 9, 1899: Creation of the Festival Committee of Saumur.
The oldest photographic documents concern the flower parade of May 16, 1909.
That year, the organization was co-produced with the festival committee of the city of Paris.
Augustine Orlhac, queen of the queens of Paris, elected for the Mi-Car√™me, enthroned on a Parisian tank that evoked aviation.
The committee organized various festivities: cavalcades and flower parades, gymnastic festivals, firefighting gatherings, folk festivals, air meetings.
These mirlitons were incorporated in fake instruments with strange shapes, often shaped by skilled tinsmiths: bigophones or bigotphones.
No need to know the music to play, it was enough to know the melody.
These instruments enjoyed the same success in Cholet for the Mid-Lenten season.
The first parade (first cavalcade) of Saumur after the war took place in 1946.
Tickets for textiles, paper, spikes ... And thirty tanks took off, most often pulled by horses.
A general theme was defined by the committee, each tank to follow this theme.
The parades took place first in May and then on a Sunday in late June.
Prizes were instituted to reward the most enterprising neighborhoods.
The consequence of this emulation was a kind of neighborhood patriotism which reached its peak in 1960.
Their enthusiasm was commensurate with the trials they had gone through.
Building large tanks with complicated techniques is no longer a priority.
He defied Fleuri connut another preterite period from 1977 to 1984.
They put their hands in the dough and their windows illustrated the theme of the year.
Other sources of funding had to be found, more in the form of grants.
A month later, for the flowery parade, there remained only the threads.
From the 1980s, on new poles in synthetic fibers, the blue and red banners, in the colors of Anjou.
The excitement began the day before with a concert of municipal music, later formations participating in the parade.
Sunday morning was the exit of the tanks, like butterflies tearing their chrysalis.
It was often necessary to finish unfolding them, to build them outside, especially for the parts in height.
Unfortunately, if the weather was threatening, it was so late for the afternoon.
After a quick lunch, the tanks and groups converged on the Gare district and the Croix-Verte.
The sending of a fire rocket to the entrance of the Cadet Bridge (14H30) announced the departure of the parade.
The holiday committee had its own confetti vendors wearing the yellow and blue armbands.
(Imprimerie du Progres, Saumur, Lemercier, Longue, Buro-Modern, Saumur).
He stood quietly on the sidewalks in Sunday's clothes.
Some attended the parade flourished with the same fervor as for the procession of Corpus Christi.
The paying stands were installed place of the Bilange, near a fountain decorated until the 1970s with a seahorse.
It was a rallying point for all the kids in the neighborhood before and after the parade.
Their success was assured as well as the sale of other treats, still rare in the 1950s.
Then it was the time of the cameras "super 8" before the arrival of the video (1988).
The vehicles that carried most of the tanks, old reconverted cars, had engines that were sometimes recalcitrant.
It was not uncommon to use the service tow truck to pull a particular tank.
The queens of each neighborhood, accompanied by children, sat on the tanks in a rather uncomfortable way, like the seats of old tractors.
But the spectators were not always attentive to their passage which marked the end of the parade.
It was not easy to get into the small streets of Saumur.
Thus, rue Saint-Jean, one of the oldest streets of Saumur.
The largest tanks were waiting because they could not pass.
Firefighters were partying but not "at the party".
Given the large audience and the dangers of ignition, it was necessary to be able to intervene very quickly.
Given their fiscal power, however, governments are in a position to offer a credible guarantee.
Meanwhile, standing on their gear, behind the spectators, they watched the parade pass.
It was necessary to make quickly between the procession of the afternoon and that of the night to put the tanks in light.
For a long time, we could only rely on batteries and headlights of cars or trucks.
These batteries of cars and trucks are also the business of Carnavaliers de Cholet at the beginning of their night parades.
For many viewers, it was the only way to keep photographic memories of the party.
A slide show was organized in the "foyer" of the theater a few days after the party.
It was especially an opportunity for all the builders and participants to finally see the fruit of their work.
Kind of unbridled and carnivalesque parade where no one took himself seriously.
Parents could leave their work to participate in the party.
In the 1980s, schoolchildren took advantage of "Mayor's Day".
Over time, it became impossible to paralyze the downtown area.
This return of cavalcade was offered in turn in a specific district of the city.
But the show lost in popularity: in 1966: neighborhoods Gare, Croix-Verte, the Bridges, from 15H30.
Often, the party ended with a parade in each neighborhood, local music ranging from bar to bar.
Several tanks had a second life being rented for other holidays.
This was the case with the Saint-Michel Feast in Angers.
On the 1990 program, "Festivals of the World" is mistakenly listed in 1989.
In 1974, Jacques Pucelle and some friends created the "Confraternity of Joyeux Cavalcadiers de Saumur" (today "Happy Festivalboys").
From drawings, he passed to the models then entrusted to the builders, including students from the college of Saint-Lambert-des-Lev√©es.
He also made the model of the Saumur theater hall.
In 1985, it is acquired to alternate the flowery parade with a festival of military music.
She has participated in almost all the flower parades and many other events in the Saumur region.
Her participation in the parade on July 14 in Paris will make her known beyond the borders.
Several CDs will be recorded by Cor√©lia, following recordings on vinyl records.
The restructuring of the army in the 2000s, the end of conscription will be the main causes of its dissolution.
But the breath is given: Saumur will become a city famous for its festival of Military Musics.
The "International Festival of Giants" then "Giants and Masks" replaces the flowery parade.
Change of name and festival of even years alternating with the International Festival of Military Music (odd years).
The giants are rather literary: Gargantua, Pantagruel Fran√ßois Rabelais.
The first of them was a giant: Coco Chanel, who lived a brief part of her life in Saumur.
The aesthetic has improved over the years and the rule to keep the giants respected.
With the end of the flower parade, it is also the gradual abandonment of queens from different neighborhoods.
Note the absence of ambassadors of Saumur (queens before) from 1992 to 1998, then again, from 2010.
The bombing operations last until October 7, the day the English retreat is ordered.
The incompetence of the English engineers, as well as the loss of men by fatigue and disease, compel the commander to cease the offensive.
This is actually proposed October 7, shortly after the departure of the enemy and remains without result.
The beginnings of the siege of Lorient have their origins on the American front of the War of Austrian Succession.
The King of Great Britain hears about this proposal and asks the general if a plan is ready.
It is then decided to send ships to locate the places for landing on these coasts.
In addition, ships would have to be spotted again, which would delay the operation.
It can count on a fleet of 16 ships of line, 8 frigates and 43 transports.
The fleet leaves Plymouth on September 26th and doubles Ouessant without being spotted by the French.
The commanders of the ports of the Atlantic and the Channel are thus alerted and in particular Port-Louis, on September 24th.
At the same time, ships ordered by Mac Nemara must join Lorient where they are expected.
The city has also become a strategic commercial and military place.
Arsenals build and maintain ships of the Royal Navy and the East India Company.
The latter also chose in 1732 to move the commercial headquarters, previously located in Nantes.
The city is also at the center of a cabotage activity that extends from Brest to Nantes, then Bordeaux.
Finally, a Marian cult developed in the region from the 1620s.
They also take the backdrop of opposition between Protestant English and Catholic Bretons.
The fleet wets in the Pouldu Bay from the evening of September 29, near the mouth of the La√Øta.
The same day, Deschamps, who commands the citadel of Port Louis, requires troops to several cities in the region.
The French forces that had to retreat arrive in Lorient the same evening.
St Clair requires a looting fee for four hours and a large sum of money.
The goal is mainly to gain time to allow reinforcements to arrive.
He was able to interrogate English prisoners and is thus aware of the weaknesses of the adversary.
On the evening of October 5th, the King learns at Versailles the news of the English landing.
He then decided to detach troops from the Flanders front to send them to reinforce in the west.
There are two infantry battalions, one dragons, two horse-racing regiments, and one major-law.
In addition, almost a third of British troops must participate in the transport of artillery, which contributes to their weakening.
The houses of Lorient, built with many stones and little wood are too resistant to fire English.
English troops begin to shrink because of fatigue and illness.
They must face the exits of the militia, and must defend their camp in the moor of Keroman.
But few leaders in the world face such strong opposition domestically.
St Clair concludes that circumstances dictate that the siege be lifted.
The bombings continue without much success, the next day, Friday, October 7.
It is only Sunday, October 9th that the last troops are re-embarked while a contrary wind prevents an immediate departure.
He can not find enemies and must return to Lorient around 22 hours.
He then thinks of a trick of the English and orders a reinforcement of the defenses of the city.
Some harassments are carried out by Coast Guard militia, but the cavalry and dragon troops refuse to take part.
Lorient residents remain on the alert fearing that British reinforcements will land in the region.
In Paris, the shareholders of the East India Company are alarmed at the announcement, via Versailles, the headquarters.
The British fleet is heading east of Lorient to begin attacking several points of the coast.
However, on October 10, a storm broke out and five transports involving nearly 900 men lost the rest of the convoy.
Although promised and expected by the command, the reinforcement of three battalions will never reach the spot.
The peninsula of Quiberon is occupied and looted from 14 to 20 October.
Attacks are then perpetrated against the islands of Houat on October 20th and Ho√´dic on the 24th.
The defenses erected by Vauban on these islands are taken without combat and degraded.
Belle-√éle-en-Mer was blockaded until the departure of the squadron on October 29th.
The different raids disrupt traffic in the region, but the operation has no effect on the ongoing conflict.
Strong gusts of wind hit the fleet on the way home and disperse the ships.
The news of the defeat preceded the arrival of Lestock, and he was summoned to give his command.
These accusations are later repeated by Nicolas Tindal to explain the fate of the expedition.
The English raid makes one aware of the weaknesses of the defenses of the region.
Several measures are taken from 1750 and the Duke d'Aiguillon arrives as new governor of Brittany.
In the region of Lorient, a new system of maritime and terrestrial defenses is being started.
In the latter, a circular battery and barracks were built between 1756 and 1758.
On the peninsula of Quiberon, a strong blocking the entrance of it is built in Penthi√®vre and completed in 1760.
A controversy develops a few years after the battle between the relationship of events by Voltaire and David Hume.
Several relatives urge him to publish it, and a draft is drafted.
A translation of this letter is published in French in the "British Journal" in 1756, but remains unanswered.
It is also used as a reference by the local press of the time to oppose Protestant England.
Several artistic productions of the time as of the following centuries refer to this event.
Louis Le Cam refers to a first short six-verse poem describing the arrival of the English in the Lorient region.
The functioning of the USSR later served as a model for other communist regimes, with:
Refusing the de-Stalinization, Mao's China breaks with the USSR, but remains isolated.
The Soviet Union then uses its military and political power to prevent any substantial reform of the communist world.
New communist regimes are emerging in the Americas (Cuba), Asia and Africa.
Maoist China also suffered disasters during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.
Many Communist parties, as well as several regimes claiming this ideology, still exist.
The myth of the golden age then plays an important role in the theoretical constructions of the classical and Hellenistic school.
Plato imagines, in "The Republic", an ideal city, divided into three classes: the workers, the warriors and the leaders.
Communities established in Moravia, in the movement of the Moravian Brothers, practice community fraternity and have nothing of their own.
On the ideological level, Babeuf advocates a society based on de facto equality, common administration and the abolition of private property.
Philippe Buonarroti, companion of Babeuf, is working in the following decades to maintain and disseminate Babouvistes ideas.
The Taiping are later retrieved by various Chinese schools of thought, including the Communists, who present them as precursors.
To this prefixed root is added the suffix "-ism" denoting a "doctrine".
They refer to members of Christian sects who shared some, if not all, of their property.
Christian Democrats, even conservative parties, have adopted its principles.
In the late 1770s, its Italian equivalent, "communisti", refers to the inhabitant of a rural commune.
According to the historian Jacques Grandjonc, the term seems to have known a certain fortune in the geographical area Provence-Alpes-Toscane.
The writer Restif de la Bretonne seems to have played a decisive role in the semantic evolution of the concept.
In 1785, he published the letter of a landowner, Joseph Alexandre Victor of Hupay de Fuveau, who declares himself a "communist".
Repeating several Platonic conceptions, he declares himself in favor of a "community" education, detached at least partially from the family circle.
Written and published ten years later, "Monsieur Nicolas" multiplies the occurrences of "communist" and creates the French term of "communism".
The two words refer to a specific political ideology: "Babouvism", the thought of Gracchus Babeuf.
H√∂lderlin has repeatedly expressed support for the pooling of goods.
Heiress of Babouvism, the secret society of the egalitarian workers attaches "communist" to the notion of revolutionary proletarian.
In the 1840s, the noun "community" competes in usage with the abstract term "communism".
On the other hand, the adjective "communist" seems to have quickly supplanted the alternative term "community".
The questions of labor and private property inspire many thinkers of the socialist family with radical writings.
Theorists are not necessarily precise about the way in which capitalist society passes to community society.
The League of the just is taken over in 1846 by Joseph Maximilian Moll and Karl Schapper.
Close in their youth to young Hegelians, they reject the Christian conceptions of communism, and instead advocate a militant atheism.
The following year, Adolphe Thiers published the booklet "Du communisme", in which he attacked Marx and Proudhon jointly.
no-valid-translation
This first communism of Marx contrasts with the more radical communism of the Babouvists.
The rational working methods developed by the bourgeoisie will thus be taken up and systematized by the proletariat.
The "Manifesto of the Communist Party" of 1848 thus describes an "industrial army" which acts in concordance with a "common plan".
Here emerges one of the main contradictions of Marx's communism, which testifies to the plurality of its original influences.
Two or three different approaches to communism can be reconciled.
After the failure of the revolutionary movements of 1848, Marx and, more particularly, his collaborator Friedrich Engels tend to favor the modernist approach.
Quite scarred by Darwinian biology, they seek to give their work a scientific guarantee.
The careful observation of economic and social exchanges and the deduction of the laws of history take precedence over romantic speculations.
Communism conceived as a logical consequence of the imbalances of capitalism is objectified and rationalized.
It is now the product of an association between planning technicians and performers.
The dictatorship of the proletariat first ensures the complete overthrow of the bourgeoisie and its institutions.
As a historical object, communism poses a problem of another order: that of its realization.
During the revolutions of 1848, Marx thus wondered about the case of Germany.
Concretely, the proletariat must facilitate the advent of a parliamentary democracy without losing sight of its own destiny.
Generally reluctant to speculate on the future, he leaves several ambiguities and uncertainties in his historical pattern.
In 1864, several European socialist organizations tried to agree within the International Association of Workers (or "First International").

The reformist intellectuals published in May a manifesto demanding, in a much more radical way, a democratization of the system.
Dubƒçek, forced to submit, is kept a time in power before being finally dismissed, in favor of Gust√°v Hus√°k.
W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka reacts by using force and sixteen workers are killed in the repression, further increasing popular anger.
Protestants, mostly Catholic, are galvanized in 1978 by the election of the Polish Pope John Paul II.
Solidarno≈õƒá was formed shortly thereafter under the leadership of strike leader Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa.
The same year, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa receives the Nobel Peace Prize, much to the displeasure of the Polish authorities.
Marshal Tito's appointment as President for life in 1974- is the main political glue of the country.
The People's Republic of Albania, unlike Yugoslavia, refuses any form of liberalization.
Enver Hoxha is also covering the Albanian territory with thousands of bunkers, supposed to protect the country from outside enemies.
In 1968, the country officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact and CMEA.
In the late 1970s, China's evolution towards reformism led Albania to break with its Asian ally.
The USSR is unenthusiastic about this rapprochement, judging the insurgency of Castro hopeless.
In the last days of December, the government army disbanded and Batista fled on New Year's Eve.
Castro travels to the United States, where he tries in vain for a charm operation, the American government remaining suspicious.
Che Guevara, without training as an economist, becomes minister of industry and head of the Cuban central bank.
Cuba lives for several years without truly organized institutions and does not adopt a constitution until 1976.
The missile crisis causes extreme tension in international relations and fears a nuclear war.
Castro goes so far as to propose to Khrushchev to use nuclear weapons against the United States in the event of an attack on Cuba.
The Cuban government is accelerating the collectivization of the economy, launching a series of nationalizations and a second agrarian reform in 1963.
In 1963, on the advice of the USSR, Cuba reoriented its economy towards sugar production.
Che Guevara is soon supplanted by technocrats supported by the Soviet Union.
The latter is however killed three months later, which marks the end of an era.
In 1972, the country joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, becoming the official Eastern bloc sugar supplier.
Massively helped by the USSR, Cuba is gradually accumulating a very high external debt.
Japan can not continue to accumulate debt on debt.
The army, highly developed, is organized in Soviet fashion, the militia being added to the defense system.
The companions of Fidel Castro who are reluctant to the Marxist turn fall out of favor and are often imprisoned.
In the 1970s, Castro sent many civilian and military co-workers to various African countries.
The CCP is strengthening its control over the country's economy by accelerating agricultural collectivization and then socializing the urban economy.
The social and political malaise grows against the instructions of the Party.
Beginning in 1958, the whole Chinese policy is punctuated by the impulses and failures of Maoism.
In a context of intense propaganda and ideological fervor, unrealistic goals are set.
740000 agricultural cooperatives merge into 24000 people's communes and, at the end of the year, bring together all the Chinese peasants.
The Great Leap Forward, an ultra-voluntarist project, is largely improvised without the technical and planning apparatus being able to follow.
The Chinese government must, in the autumn of 1960, operate urgently a complete reversal of its policy.
In 2010, the Chinese government readjusted its economic policy.
Intellectuals enjoy more freedom and people control becomes more flexible.
At the same time, China continues to pursue a moderate economic and social policy.
The cultural revolution is, by its violence and fanaticism, a lasting trauma for Chinese society.
Destitute, Liu Shaoqi dies in prison; Peng Dehuai is also incarcerated.
Gradually, the balance tilts in favor of the supporters of the reconstruction of the apparatus in its classical form.
In 1972, the visit of the American president Richard Nixon seals dramatically the Sino-American rapprochement.
China is slowly recovering from the cultural revolution, the political and social climate provoking discontent and dissidence.
The physical weakening of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, both sick, reinforces antagonisms within the Party.
The southern regime is heavily repressing supporters of North Vietnam who maintain guerrilla homes on its soil.
Concerned about the changing context in Southeast Asia, the United States decides to become more involved.
In 1961, the new President Kennedy increased the number of US military advisers to help counter-insurgency.
In 1961, Soekarno theorized a political line based on the alliance of nationalism, religion and communism, and called "Nasakom".
Soekarno's policy, in the context of the Vietnam War, is of great concern to the Americans.
One of the consequences of eradicating Indonesian Communism has been to push China and the USSR to temporarily disengage from the Third World.
The Vietnamese conflict also inspires other guerrillas of rural origin, such as the Naxalites in India.
In South-East Asia itself, Vietnam's conflict is increasingly overcoming neighboring countries.
Very weakened by the losses suffered during the offensive, the FNL is now more subordinate to the Vietnamese People's Army.
US troops then carry out an intervention in Cambodia to support the unstable Lon Nol regime.
In the following years, several hundred thousand boat-people flee Vietnam by sea.
The situation is much more dramatic in Cambodia, renamed Democratic Kampuchea in January 1976.
The population, put to forced labor in the fields, is subjected to a total arbitrariness, where everything can become a pretext to execution.
The regime implements ethnic and religious persecution, the incompetence of the Khmer Rouge administration contributing to cause a terrible famine.
Cambodia is becoming a theater of Sino-Soviet rivalry in Southeast Asia.
Vietnam, supported by the USSR, is striving to support the friendly Cambodian regime and reduce the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
In East Asia, the Mongolian People's Republic experienced a political transition in 1952 after the death of Horloogiyn Choybalsan.
Yumjagiyn Tsedenbal, already secretary general of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, succeeds him as head of the government.
The government is working to reform Mongolian society by fighting nomadism and promoting urbanization.
Still very closely allied with the USSR, Mongolia joined the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance in 1962.
In May 1964, the Party splits, the left forming the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
The two organizations are soon opposed by a particularly bitter rivalry.
In the course of the 1960s, the PCI oscillated between the frontal opposition with the Congress and the cooperation with it.
Despite a severe police repression, the Naxalite rebellion continues to cause several hundred deaths each year.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) then goes beyond the historical PCI, a balance of power that then remains unchanged.
In the 1970s, the PCI (m) won elections in the states of Kerala and West Bengal.
Gradually, both CPs evolve into a form of social democracy, conducive to cooperation with Indian and foreign capitalists.
In Nepal, starting in 1960, the communist party is divided over relations with the ruling power.
The Nepalese CP then explodes in multiple tendencies: the Nepalese communist movement becomes one of the most divided in the world.
In 1977, the Rakah formed with the protest movement of the Black Panthers the Hadash coalition.
In Iran, the Tudeh has a long period of clandestine activity after the Ajax operation of 1953.
Various other communist organizations exist in the circles of Iranian political exiles.
In 1965, an organization posing as the Egyptian Communist Party announced its self-dissolution.
The Tunisian Communist Party was banned in 1963 by Habib Bourguiba's government, and was not allowed again until 1981.
Ahmed Ben Bella, Algerian president from 1962 to 1965, advised by the Trotskyist Michel Pablo, is open to self-management experiments.
Ben Bella's successor, Houari Boumediene, opted instead for an industrialization inspired by that of the USSR.
The USSR must rethink its alliance system in the Middle East and concentrate much of its support on the PLO.
In Syria, after the seizure of power by Hafez al-Assad in 1971, the Syrian Communist Party is again authorized.
He joins forces with the new regime and joins the Progressive National Front, the coalition led by the Baath Party.
Relations between communists and Baathists, however, deteriorate and the PC is banned in 1981.
The Kurdistan Workers' Party, a Kurdish independence group, also claims Marxism-Leninism.
But, from 1977, his relations with the Communists deteriorate.
The USSR, which wants above all to avoid that the situation degenerates in Afghanistan, supports the faction of Karmal.
In September 1979, Taraki is overthrown by Amin, who then makes him murder in prison.
Amin is killed during the assault on his residence by the Soviets; Karmal replaces him immediately.
Intended to bring calm, the Soviet invasion leads to a result diametrically opposite.
Karmal, having lost the confidence of the Soviets, must leave the power and give way in 1986 to Mohammed Nadjibullah.
Gorbachev meanwhile decides the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan: the withdrawal of the USSR was completed in February 1989.
Black Africa is not one of the priorities of the communist movement before 1945.
In 1958, S√©kou Tour√© became the president of independent Guinea.
The USSR also relies on Kwame Nkrumah's Ghana and Modibo Keita's Mali.
In 1961, Guinea reproached the Soviets for their interference in its internal affairs and expelled the USSR ambassador.
Guevara is disappointed with his African experience, believing that African nationalism is not mature enough and that Marxism has not penetrated it too much.
The PC then joins the African National Congress (ANC) in the fight against apartheid.
Between 1969 and 1975 communism made important progress in black Africa, thanks to political instability and guerrilla warfare.
The Congolese Labor Party, founded for the occasion, becomes a single party.
The Angolan conflict, particularly violent, continues to spill over the South African border.
In Mozambique, RENAMO also receives support from the United States, South Africa and, until 1979, Rhodesia.
In 1980, seven African regimes invoked Marxism-Leninism, others various forms of socialism.
Between 1960 and 1967, guerrilla movements touched about twenty countries on the American continent.
The guerrillas also fail in most cases to mobilize the peasants they were supposed to release.
A "modus vivendi" is then found between the USSR and Cuba on support for armed struggles on the continent.
Popular discontent grows over Allende's economic policy, which soon runs the risk of being a victim of a coup d'etat.
The Sandinista regime is soon experiencing an authoritarian drift and opposition newspapers regularly suffer temporary bans.
Mainly through Cuba, Grenada establishes links with other communist regimes.
In October, Bishop is overthrown and then executed by his opponents within the Party: a military government takes power.
While various PCs remain powerful in several Western European countries, the crisis of European communism becomes obvious in the 1980s.
The PCF became de-stalinisation and served as the lawyer of the USSR.
Under the leadership of Waldeck Rochet, successor to Maurice Thorez, the party began to approach the middle classes.
The PCI still progressed in the general elections, winning 25.3% of the vote in 1963, then 26.9% in 1968.
The entry of the PCI into a coalition government, as part of the historic compromise, is seriously under consideration.
This is an adaptation of Jorge Sempr√∫n's memoir book, "Writing or Life".
In 1945, Manuel, a former deported from Buchenwald, wondered how to talk about the experience of concentration camps.
Concentration camps like Buchenwald continued to work, with different guards and detainees.
Through his encounters, he comes back to life but at the same time chooses to wallow in silence.
Constituted in 1956, it will intervene mainly in the framework of war of Algeria as well as with Suez (Egypt)
In the course of time the division undergoes reshuffles and new units come to swell its ranks:
The military intervention is a success, but under international pressure, France and England are forced to evacuate Egypt on December 22.
In addition, a military or semi-military intervention is not the only option.
Thanks to intelligence and especially the systematic use of torture, Massu takes the advantage.
In September 1957, the FLN of Algiers is moribund and the attacks reduced to nothing.
In "The Question", Henri Alleg has one of these officers say:
responds: "Certainly not" and continue "I do not think we can say that these methods have been institutionalized".
As in the majority of Algeria's units, rallying is not unambiguous, and officers' attitude is often expectant.
BADGE: Rectangle party of 3 colors (the berets) carrying in heart a black plunging eagle.
They aim to elect the 175 deputies of the National Assembly for 5 years.
It is again, after the presidential one a success for the PDCI.
Only 3 parties are represented in the Assembly for the 9th legislature.
The PIT, big loser of these elections lost a month ago the presidential one.
In the ensuing elections, they lost a large number of votes.
Francis Wodi√© being the only candidate to oppose Henri Konan B√©di√© and to represent the party in the legislative elections.
Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez is a town located in the department of Canelones in southern Uruguay.
At the census of population in 2004, the city had 6214 inhabitants.
At that time, when it had 100 million inhabitants, it represented 20% of the world's population.
Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez is part of the metropolitan area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMontevideo, north-west of Barros Blancos, between the cities of Toledo and Pando.
The city was founded in 1882 and was named after Uruguayan President Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez.
Founded in 1966, it was the first multidisciplinary scientific research institute in Korea.
It contributed significantly to the country's economic development, especially during the booming years of the 1970s and 1980s.
The development of civil societies, economic growth and openness to the world are equally important.
Beyond the growth prospects of developing countries is a deeper question.
This is particularly true for developing countries and emerging markets.
Rapid growth in developing countries is helping to reduce poverty.
To defend himself and resist the Deanides troops, Liang sealed an alliance with the Illyd People.
Further south, the Pacific Eukrates met Sansheide fanatics, who attacked them for no apparent reason.
As for the mysterious Nomads of Hefidjah, it seems that no one could come into contact with them or even locate their camp.
The capital of the Imperial State, Fae, is also the capital of the Empire.
On D√´an, the years are counted from the advent of the First Emperor of the di Mavelli dynasty.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 550 TE (Emperor's Time).
D√´anide society is feudal and relies on alliances to provide protection and help between suzerains and vassals.
During the Prelude and Season 1, mention is made of the existence of several gods.
The Vital Fire Cult seems to allow its followers to manipulate the flames and use them for combat.
However, Roland is also able to project devastating flames.
There is no mention of an advanced science of help in the Ascension of Emonis.
No complex mechanics are described, nor is any control of the steam engine or even powder.
Some warriors are described as having magical powers usually related to the manipulation of fire.
The character of Elyssa is described as having manifested telepathic abilities.
If the magic seems to come from the Vital Cult of Fire, it is not reserved for clerics.
On these Demons, we know very little but it seems clear that their objective is indeed war.
E√ºKratos is a totally unified world in an egalitarian system, composed of four continents (Keledi, Alanna, Orkadei and Polepe√Øn).
The authority of this President is totally subject to the popular decisions expressed during consultations which seem as natural as they are frequent.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 2893 AS (After Salvation).
The e√ºKrate society is democratic and seems to hold all its citizens absolutely equal.
Among the six worlds of Civilized, E√ºKratos seems the most destabilized by the Awakening of Space.
It is this question that mainly occupies the main e√ºKrates characters in Season 1 (Episode 1- Metamorphoses).
There is no mention of an e√ºKrate cult in the Ascension of Emonis.
It is even noted that the Sansheids call the Eukrates "The Atheists".
E√ºKratos is shown as one of the Six Mondes which has the most advanced technology.
As advanced as it is, the e√ºKrate technology seems to work less well in the Seventh World than on E√ºKratos.
With the exception of Aloiph, states seem united within the Republic.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 1095 AR (Year of the Revolution).
There is much evidence that the illydian society places women above men in different hierarchies.
In any case, the officers of the People's Army are exclusively women, as are the political leaders.
In both cases, these leaders are called "Ladies of the People".
According to the same Shem, this is what makes Illyd's army a formidable disciplined and effective war machine.
In the episode In the Name of the People, it is said that the resitants believe in the divinity Il-Torg-Ad.
Illyd has at least mechanical vehicles based on the principle of the engine or helicopters.
The soldiers are indeed not equipped with weapons as sophisticated as those of the Ladies but simple rifles.
Be that as it may, Wakoff's powers seem extremely extensive, compared to those of his fellow soldiers.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 829 EY (Yuze Era).
The liang-nen society is feudal but much less centralized than the society of anne.
The Knights of the Empire explicitly refers to a pantheon called the Ineffable Invisible Company.
It is also stated that Shun-Ka Corporation of the Land of Shadows has a special relationship with worship.
In Season 1, we learn a little more about this cult.
There is no mention of a very advanced liang-nen science in the Ascension of Emonis.
No complex mechanics are described, nor is any control of the steam engine or even powder.
It is explicitly mentioned that some Liang-Nens have magical powers such as telepathy or a form of instant teleportation.
Hefidjah is a world of two huge hemispherical continents separated by a relatively small body of water.
The Hefidjan calendar seems to be a religious calendar based on the advent of the pantheon called Fratria Celestia.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 1817 FC (after the advent of Fratria Celestia).
The history of Hefidjane culture is sketched in the texts accompanying the maps of the different territories that make up this world.
They are Estumnai, Rean, Moben, Sanclas and Tunta.
Of the Jula d'Estumnai, we know that they are led by Nio, who is gifted with superhuman strength and agility.
Hefidjane politics is complex since it seems to be based on influence rather than power.
No mention has been made of any Hefidjan army during the Prelude and Season 1.
From this worship we know very little.
According to Nio Julas d'Estumnai, the Wood Key would be a religious symbol on his world.
Moreover, the name of a god Vaya- is mentioned.
The limited evidence also suggests that hefidjane technology is rudimentary.
But there is nothing else to suggest that the health of Swedes is deteriorating.
We know that some on Hefidjah have access to magic.
In Season 1, Suraj Julas is shown as having powers (Episode 7-Duels).
Moreover, it is clear that some people have a gift of clairvoyance on Hefidjah, as for example Ad√© Julas d'Estumnai.
The use of the written word does not seem widespread and the Hefidjane culture is mostly transmitted orally.
The Sanshide calendar is the second reign of the supreme god Agathyor.
The Awakening of Space takes place in 733 2CAg (Second Cycle of Agathyor).
Some socio-religious facts are exposed in the texts accompanying the maps of the different Sansh territories.
Sansheide society seems at first sight rather primitive, based on simple hierarchies based on force.
It should be noted that the ecclesiastical hierarchy seems to be extremely powerful on Sansh.
The High Priests of the five great Sansheid deities seem to have colossal powers, especially Toch Naz, the High Priest of Agathyor.
Moreover, the Sansheids are described by the Eukrates as being "fanatics", impervious to any form of rationality.
The Five Gods Cult of EmGath is essential on Sansh.
As on D√´an, it seems that magic is linked to worship without it appearing to be exclusively reserved for ecclesiastics.
In addition, during his tribulations, he faces an ancient heretical and blasphemous cult (Episode 9 - Temptations).
It is also explained that this is not mechanical magic.
Besides, Sansheide magic seems to be more difficult to operate in the Seventh World than on Sansh.
It seems that the foundations of Sansh's world unity are religious and not political.
Each of these Gates is a passage between the world of origin and the Seventh World.
For example, the White Gate connects Dean to the Seventh World, and the Gate of Light connects Sansh to the Seventh World.
Obediently blind to their Prophethood, the Deans instantly prepared a campaign against Liang-Kiba's black door.
The Liang-Nens were quickly attacked by the army on the Seventh World and the Unified Kingdoms were almost invaded.
It was then that an alliance was forged with Illyd to resist the imperialism of Rome, which made it possible to repel the White Armies.
Being convinced of the danger represented by the violence of the Infinite Empire, Illyd took a very active part in the clashes.
Sansh immediately identified them as ridiculously weak, and decided to submit them first.
The Deanides were stationed at the exit of a canyon that the Illydians call the "Lemneshian Mountains".
This is the first major battle between different worlds (about 6000 e√ºKrates soldiers against 2,500 Sansheids).
This battle also has a special status because of its extremely violent outcome.
In the south-east, the ezKrate Polemology Department (the army) reorganized itself with Lektra Emonis as its head and began to prepare for the future.
At the same time, the Department of Xenology was created by Demio Seuhein to study the customs, knowledge and practices of the other five peoples.
Meanwhile, on the Seventh World, a faction made up of deserters from different worlds emerged.
The Civilized series is exclusively available on the official website of the collection.
This site wants to be totally immersive and also contains several bonus content such as videos, music, maps ...
Ascension of Emonis is the first narrative arc of the Civilized series.
The story recounted in this Prelude begins 180 days after the Awakening of Space and ends 6 days later.
The main characters of Civilized come from the six worlds and therefore represent different civilizations and different ways of thinking:
This locality is crossed by the Camino Franc√©s of the Pilgrimage of Santiago de Compostela.
On the Camino Franc√©s Pilgrimage of Santiago de Compostela, we come from the locality of As Paredes in the "municipio" of Sarria.
The next stop is the locality of Barbadelo, in the same "municipio".
The next war, the next attack or the next abortive peace initiative awaits us there.
An emergency organization has also been set up to deal with possible disasters.
In addition, international relief organizations are desperately short of funds and resources.
France, with the exception of the Antilles and other French archipelagos, is a country with moderate seismicity.
The historical data are collected in a database accessible via the Internet, called Sisfrance.
In particular, a new regulatory framework was put in place in 2011.
The seismic zoning in effect since 1991 has itself been modified on this occasion.
The municipal information folder on major risks (DICRIM) specifies at municipal level these risks.
It is supplemented by the communal plan of safeguard which defines the organization to face it.
Finally, since 2006, the information of buyers or tenants must be made on the risks to which the property is exposed.
France, with the exception of the West Indies, is a country with moderate seismicity.
However, earthquakes are relatively frequent and the seismic risk must be taken into account.
In the Caribbean, seismicity is stronger and this risk is now recognized as the first natural hazard.
French Polynesia is located in an intraplate zone and has low to moderate seismicity.
The knowledge of historical seismicity in France is based on a documentary analysis of historical archives.
The analysis of these different documents leads to define for each event an epicenter and an associated intensity.
The data is collected in a database accessible via the Internet, called Sisfrance.
It is supplemented by databases specific to the French West Indies and the Mascarene and Comoros archipelagos.
The diagram on the right illustrates the relationships between the different organizations involved and the skill levels.
The oldest deadly earthquakes in France occurred in:
The most recent earthquakes in France occurred:
The hazard assessment is defined by a national seismic zoning map.
The national territory is divided into several zones according to the possible levels of seismicity.
A first seismic zoning was established in parallel with the 1969 regulations.
The national territory is then divided into five zones of increasing seismicity (0, Ia, Ib, II and III).
About 5,000 municipalities are then located in a very weak to strong seismic zone (zones Ia to III).
The approach followed to develop this map is an "empirico-statistical" approach.
Then a probabilistic analysis of the seismic events could be made on the whole national territory.
Several iso-acceleration maps corresponding to different levels of annual probabilities have been established.
It is this nominal acceleration which is taken into account for the application of the rules of seismic constructions.
The elementary territorial unit is no longer the canton, but the commune, which allows a better appreciation of the seismic hazard.
The denomination of the zones changes and no zone is henceforth considered as being absent from any seismic hazard.
Zone 5 corresponds to the highest level of hazard and concerns the French West Indies.
To further characterize the seismic hazard for special risk installations, seismic-techtonic maps are established.
But this risk of moral hazard is also accompanied by a risk of political debacle.
This map evolves according to the knowledge of historical earthquakes and the understanding of their mechanism.
The regulatory framework then regularly evolved according to international events or in connection with international regulatory developments.
A classification in five categories depending on the number of people admitted simultaneously in an establishment is introduced.
They are supplemented by PS-MI89 / 92 rules, which are more simplified, and which concern only individual houses.
Fran√ßois Soulages is an art critic and a French esthetician, specialized in aesthetics of photography.
Since the year 2000, he is professor of aesthetics in the department of visual arts of Paris VIII University.
He chairs the "iconic College" with Jean-Michel Rodes and Serge Tisseron as well as RETINA.International.
In this context he organizes numerous symposiums all over the world as well as coffee-philo in Paris.
Many GPs around the world underestimate the severity of depression.
His book "Aesthetics of Photography" has already been translated into several languages.
In 2007, the collection ¬´L'Image & les images¬ª aux l'ditions Klincksieck is based.
He also directs or co-directs several editorial collections, "EIDOS" and "Local / Global" published by L'Harmattan, Paris.
The Marquis Ren√©-Louis de Girardin was born February 24, 1735 in Paris.
It represents the fifth generation of Gherardini established in France, and carries the first French name "Girardin".
The first ancestor settled in France was Claude, ennobled in 1643, whose wife was Anne de Chaumont.
His son Pierre, great-grandfather of Ren√©-Louis (1618-1657) married in 1643 Anne de Villers.
With Louise-Fran√ßoise Bellinzani (1664-1752), whom he married in 1680, he had two sons, Alexandre-Louis (1685-1745) and Louis-Alexandre (1699-1782).
- Marquis Ren√©-Louis de Girardin's mother was the Marquise de Vauvray, born Catherine Hatte.
Few documents provide information on the childhood and youth of Ren√©-Louis de Girardin.
The latter appointed Girardin to teach his bodyguards, and then made them their captain.
From his stays at the military camps, Girardin had retained the authoritarian will of the man accustomed to the command.
The former King of Poland is fond of the arts and the theater, and Palissot is regularly present at court.
At the same time, Girardin has already discovered his taste for Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideas.
He reacts with disgust on a representation of the play of Palissot, "The Philosophers", at the theater of the castle of Lun√©ville.
He travels Germany, visits Italy and discovers England, a country of great and new agricultural development.
Girardin finds a passion for this country, while considering that it attaches too much importance to the label.
However, before the death of Leszczy≈Ñski, he stayed only sporadically in Ermenonville, his free time being mainly devoted to travel.
The lord of Ermenonville is in favor of a government according to the precepts developed by Rousseau in the "" Social Contract "".
He is aware of the abuses of power that the absolute monarchy makes possible, because it also costs them.
Ren√© de Girardin is indignant at seeing his peasants being unable to defend their crops against too abundant game.
France goes through an economic and agricultural crisis during the 1780s, and is very interested in the miseries of the countryside.
This economic crisis is the most important that the world has gone through in recent decades.
There was also a bow game and a "ball game".
Thus the Lord takes care of the recreation and relaxation of the villagers.
After settling in Ermenonville, Girardin's family grew to include three boys: Alexandre-Louis (1767-1848),
Rene de Girardin also hires tutors, especially German, for teaching German, science and music.
These are Claude-Louis Ch√¢telet, then Georges-Fr√©d√©ric Meyer, who died less than two years after his arrival.
In addition, Louis will later take classes with Jean-Pierre-Xavier Bidauld and leave oil paintings.
Ren√©-Louis de Girardin makes the "return to nature" advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau his credo.
According to Martin-Decaen, "Girardin, we must give him this justice, endeavored to apply his principles in his private life.
Difficult to respect during stays in Paris during the winter, simplicity is the rule in Ermenonville.
Under the Terror, Jean-Jacques Rousseau is no longer honored except for form, while moving farther and farther away.
This will not protect him from denouncing the Jacobins club.
At the same time, his sons are arrested in Paris and S√©zanne, and his daughter Sophie is imprisoned at the Abbey.
The protest and petitions of the municipality of Ermenonville do not change anything.
The former lord must find that the inhabitants were not very devoted to him, and found his gardens ransacked.
They come to live at the castle of their friend, Tautest du Plain, and no longer participate in public life.
Leaving no written testimonies of the last years of his life, we do not know how he occupies his days.
He is now a man of the past, and the glories of the Empire leave him indifferent.
Having managed to preserve her fortune during the Revolution, she is still considerable.
"Nothing could contradict his preconceived ideas, but he found in all things arguments in their favor."
Man would succeed in understanding his errors, prejudices and errors through the light of philosophy and science.
Initially, the latter had to occupy about forty hectares around the castle of Ermenonville.
The understanding of the messages that Girardin wanted to send to the walkers is not easy.
Girardin also imagined a space for games and social life.
He finds with extraordinary enthusiasm nature and "fresh trees".
If Rousseau had decided to settle temporarily in Ermenonville, it was also for his state of health became worrying.
The new environment was good for him, the writer seemed to forget the black sadness that had overwhelmed him in previous years.
To show his gratitude to Girardin's family, he gave lessons in singing and botany to the children.
His tomb, sculpted by Jacques-Philippe Le Sueur on Hubert Robert's drawings, is now only a cenotaph.
It was with reluctance that the marquis had separated from his friend.
A fairly complete account of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's stay at Ermenonville comes from the pen of Ren√©-Louis de Girardin.
The UNL language is a formal computer language for encoding a representation of the meaning of a statement.
The goal of the UNL project is to foster the emergence of true multilingualism in a rapidly expanding information society.
The highlight of the UNL project is the promotion of multilingualism.
This means that with first or second generation automatic translation engines, the internet will become multilingual.
Thus, since it is difficult to develop many language pairs, we develop as a priority translators from and to English.
So for many, the "portal to the world" is and will remain locked.
The "UNL language" is a computer language used to code a representation of the meaning of a statement.

Of course, there is still a long way to go before seeing the UNL project used by all users.
This movement still has a long way to go before becoming a political party in its own right.
Nevertheless, the UNL project currently includes 15 languages, developed by university laboratories and companies around the world.
Many companies have joined the UNL society.
The reason for this strategy is that deconversion is simpler than enconversion.
The current goal of the UNL project is to set up a set of centers scattered around the world.
Each center will provide a free deconversion and conversion service to all Internet users.
The GETALP team at the Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory is responsible for French in the UNL project.

Operation Pastorius was a sabotage plan by German agents infiltrated in the United States during the Second World War.
For this operation, eight agents who lived in the United States were recruited.
Two of them, Ernest Burger and Herbert Haupt were American citizens.
He landed George Dasch, who was the leader of the team and three other saboteurs (Burger, Quirin and Henck).
They brought with them and buried enough explosives, primers and incendiaries to carry out two years of operations.
Meanwhile, the German agents had taken a train to New York.
Clearly, the time spent in negotiations in New York will be wasted time.
Without incident, they began their mission by taking the train to Chicago and Cincinnati.
Dasch there in Washington DC and surrendered to the FBI, the other members of the gunman ignoring this trahison.

The Japanese believed that Aleutian control would prevent a possible US attack across the North Pacific.
The Faculty of Sciences of the Free University of Brussels, created in 1834, is a faculty of the Free University of Brussels.
In 1834, the Faculty of Sciences of the ULB included only the following teachings:
algebra, astronomy, geometry and trigonometry, chemistry, physics, geology, botany, zoology and comparative anatomy.
From this period date the new creations such as: the first polyvalent application in sciences (1996), D.E.A.
in computer science (interuniversity) (1996), the master's degree in computer science (1999), the D.E.A.
Another example is the creation in 1996 of the first multi-purpose application in science, D.E.A.
in computer science (interuniversity), as well as the master's degree in computer science in 1999 and D.E.A.
They participate in the same way as teachers and researchers in seminars, conferences and cultural activities.
In the same logic, students have the opportunity to integrate into the science popularization activities promoted by the Faculty.
Since 2011, the Faculty of Sciences of ULB has a department oriented solely to the dissemination and promotion of science.
This department of Diffusion of Sciences currently consists of 7 entities:
Research activities are the cornerstone of the Faculty of Science.
Structured in 11 research centers, it brings together a total of 56 units, including:
Many laboratories are also part of international networks and research programs around the world.
Research around the world shows that education is a prerequisite for sustainable growth.

Equine diseases are alterations in the functions or health of an equine.
They can have different origins, touch the whole animal or be localized in a part of its organism.
Veterinarians specializing in horse care are hippiatrists.
In order to completely immobilize an equine, the use of twists or obstacles is sometimes used.
The chain halter, the cave√ßon and the chifney are classic means of contention.
A job (sort of solid cage) is very useful and safe to hold a horse during semi-heavy care.
Some treatments can only be done under total anesthesia (horse lying down) and require the intervention of the veterinarian.
The different hygromas are at the elbow, knee, hock and ball.
The sponge, or hygroma of the elbow, is caused by the friction of the horseshoe.
The capelet, or hygroma of the hock, is due to the friction of the hock against the walls of the box.
Hygroma of the ball is a fluctuating tumor on the anterior surface.
It is an osteoarthritis of the hock resulting in a chronic lameness (not healing) more or less pronounced depending on the importance of osteoarthritis.
One can sometimes observe a deformation of the base of the hock.
One drug, Tildren, consisting of tiludronic acid, is indicated for the treatment of this disease.
It can be administered by the veterinarian after the diagnosis has been made.
Navicular disease, or navicular syndrome, is an inflammatory condition affecting the navicular bone of the anterior feet of adult horses.
The first symptoms (narrowed gait) are not obvious and it often takes an x-ray to make a clear diagnosis.
There is care to try to stop this irreversible disease and relieve the horse, but not to cure it.
It is caused by the accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles, and can cause serious circulatory and renal disorders.
The double suros, also called "pegged", appears on both sides of the barrel, as if it crossed it.
The tendon suros is, meanwhile, located on the passage of a tendon.
The vessigon is a synovial tumor that sometimes occurs on one of the lateral parts of the horse's knuckle.
It is due to excessive work or shock.
It is not very serious, being generally treated with rest and anti-inflammatory injections.
It implies, in this context, a pain that comes from a disturbance occurred in the digestive tract.
A scaffold, also called grass fire, is a kind of horse urticaria, appearing in patches.
It is due to the ingestion of new fodder or poor quality.
Mowing acne is a dermatitis that develops under the harness parts, after mowing the horse.
It is characterized by the appearance of small round and hard buttons on the skin of the animal.
Haplonemias is a benign disease of the horse's skin caused by parasites.
Also called "summer sore", it can develop when it is hot, spread through flies.
When a horse is affected by this disease, external body agents develop in his blood.
It shows the laies and small tumors, quickly bloody.
Ringworm or dermatophytosis is a mycosis affecting the skin of the horse.
Ringworm is a fungus due to the presence of fungi mainly of the genus Trichophyton or Microsporum.
This disease mainly affects young horses whose immune system is not yet developed enough.
The disease can arise as soon as their immune system weakens.
This fungus is extremely contagious and is transmitted quickly by contact between horses.
The sick horse must be isolated from its congeners to avoid any contagion.
Darkness and humidity are two favorable grounds for the development of fungi responsible for ringworm.
The light makes it possible to eliminate the presence of these fungi more quickly.
It is for this reason that ringworm occurs more during the winter season.
Corneting causes abnormal breathing noise that is usually heard at a fast pace.
It is due to paralysis of the vocal cords, often the left.
Breathing is difficult, becomes sibilant and the horse tends to suffocate during exercise.
Chronic disease, pulmonary emphysema is a degenerative lesion of the lung that gradually decreases the respiratory exchange surface.
The first symptoms are a dull, hollow cough and a painful, hasty breathing.
The oxygen passes in his blood in insufficient quantity is his lungs lose their elasticities.
Pulmonary emphysema may be triggered by an untreated viral infection or prolonged inhalation of dust.
Sourdough is an infectious disease due to the proliferation of a bacterium in the throat.
It can cause abscesses in the mouth that heal by letting out an abundant pus.
The veterinarian may prescribe an ointment to accelerate the piercing of abscesses.
Also, make sure to put water and food at a good height for him to easily reach them.
Infection of the lymph nodes in other areas of the horse's body is much more serious and often fatal.
Equine influenza is an infectious disease caused by viruses close to those of the human flu.
The first symptoms are a dry and strong cough, nasal discharge and eye discharge.
The fever can go up to 41 ¬∞ and the horse becomes apathetic.
For the equine flu does not degenerate into pneumonia, the veterinarian injects antibiotics.
The sick horse must be isolated because the disease is very contagious.
Healing takes several weeks and no work should be done on the horse until the cough is completely gone.
To prevent this disease, the horse should be vaccinated once or twice a year.
Pneumonia may be due to a viral or bacterial infection, or to a foreign body entering the lungs.
The breathing of an affected horse is difficult, painful, fast and superficial.
If you suspect pneumonia, call the veterinarian immediately.
Pneumonia of bacterial origin can be cured by a long treatment with anti-biotics.
A toad is a degeneration of the fork due to poor hygiene.
The horn can be peeled off and a smelly blackish liquid flows out.
A sort of eczema that reaches the top of the hoof, and makes it crack the horn.
It is an acute inflammatory congestion of the foot, due to various causes (overwork, dehydration).
Laminitis can be acute and must be treated urgently or chronically.
Contagious disease characterized by inflammation of the genitals, then by lesions, and even local paralysis.
Contagious Equine Metritis (ECH) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Taylorella equigenitalis.
Noncommunicable diseases are expected to be the most common causes of death in 2030.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is transmitted by mosquitoes.
The piroplasm is one of the parasites that ticks can transmit to the horse
The first (post mortem) clinical description of the disease in horses was made by Burgess et al.
A horse with tetanus has difficulty walking, chewing, swallowing.
Like humans, it must be vaccinated against tetanus (boosters every five years).
Hendra Virus is a disease caused by a henipavirus that can lead to death of the horse.
Equine infectious anemia is a contagious disease caused by a retrovirus and transmitted by blood-sucking insects.
The virus is endemic in the Americas, part of Europe, the Middle and Far East, Russia and South Africa.
Equine viral arteritis is an infectious disease related to an RNA virus, family Arteriviridae, order of the nidoviruses.
Coal is an acute infectious disease that can affect all equines, wild or domestic.

Jacques Waynberg, born in Toulouse on January 22, 1941, is a doctor of medicine, sexologist, psychotherapist and criminologist.
All of his clinical, anthropological, historical and ethnopharmacological research work builds a humanist approach to erotic function.
He continues to consult as a sexologist in his private practice in Paris.
He is also a graduate of the Faculty of Arts in Nancy the same year.
In 1968, the year of his doctorate in general medicine, he also obtained his law degree from the Institute of Political Science.
A year later, he obtains a special study certificate (CES) from occupational medicine.
In 1971, he graduated from the Faculty of Science of Nancy.
In 1973, he obtained a degree in applied biology at the Faculty of Sciences in Nancy.
He also works with the National Sex Forum Institute at the University of Chicago in the United States.
He will go back and forth between the United States and France for more than three years.
He will also carry out his first scientific cooperation missions, under the aegis of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Montreal, Moscow, Kiev.
He will also be a consultant in penitentiary psychiatry at Toul and at √âcrouves.
This year will be a pivotal year, as Dr. Jacques Waynberg creates three fundamental organizations:
In 1978 and for two years he will carry out other international cooperation missions in Kiev and Leningrad.
As 70 years ago, international cooperation is a crucial factor for success.
The French Alliance charges him to go on a scientific cooperation mission to Rome, Milan and Naples.
In 1988, he participated in the creation of the first minitel server "3617 sexolog" for the general public.
The following year, in 1989, he was laureate of the Fondation de France for overseas research in ethnopharmacology.
He will then be the Director of the University Diploma in Sexology and Public Health at the University of Paris VII.
Currently, Jacques Waynberg still practices sexology for his patients in his Parisian practice.
He is for many years very often mentioned in "the problem of the month" on Skyrock on Thursday evening.
"Pleasure together", "Body of woman", "Caresses", "OK", "OK +", "Body to enjoy and Erotica 1930".
The film industry of the Republic of Macedonia inherits a long history that begins in 1905.
He then follows the Yugoslav ideological wave, before diversifying during the 1980s.
It was not until 1923 that the Man√°kis brothers made an important film, "Macedonia".
The Skopje Institute of Hygiene then produces and produces its own documentaries from 1931 onwards.
During the 1920s, several cinemas opened in the big cities of the country.
It's been years that big cities in these countries are experiencing a surge in real estate.
Skopje is the first to have a real movie theater, the "Apollo", in 1925.
The establishment of the socialist regime in 1944 allowed Macedonia some economic expansion.
These are documentaries dedicated to the liberation and the establishment of communism that dominate.
In 1952, the studios "Vardar Film", founded in 1947, produced the first Macedonian feature film.
"Frosina" tells the story of a woman whose husband has emigrated.
Then, Vardar Film produces about a movie every two or three years.
Released in 1958, "Miss Stone" is the first Macedonian movie in color.
It tells a true story, the taking hostage of an American Protestant missionary in 1901 by the VMRO.
The film is awarded in Yugoslavia, Edinburgh and New Delhi.
This war is a great favorite theme, as are the anti-Ottoman revolts and the Communist Party.
In 1979, the Manaki Brothers International Film Festival was founded, which has since been held every year in Bitola.
It has the distinction of rewarding the directors of photography.
Then, Milcho Manchevski, with his film "Before the Rain" released in 1994, brings international recognition to the cinema of his country.
As a result of "Before the Rain", several Macedonian films from the 1990s and 2000s gain an international audience.
Pierre Sarrazin, born in Saint-M√©dard-de-Guizi√®res, lived in Bordeaux with his parents.
His father Parfait Sarrazin (1825-1892) was a merchant, married to Marie-Marthe Besse (1831-1911).
The Sarrazin family quickly leaves Bordeaux for the Sarlat area where they join the Besse parents, notables of the city.
He is, moreover, the first cousin, of Charles Sarrazin, prefect in Gironde and mayor of Libourne from 1913.
In 1887, Clemence Sarrazin gives a son to her husband, Jean-Jacques.
This is the first test that has to be overcome by Pierre Sarrazin who succeeds then everything he undertakes.
His daughter, Marie, married in the early 1900s, Paul Boudy.
His first term he gets it in Grolejac as a city councilor.
His first term as prime minister (1988-90) was brief and disorganized.
In 1882, he became municipal councilor of Sarlat then mayor in 1889, it will remain until 1924.
He is the mayor of Sarlat for 35 years!
From 1888, he is also borough councilor of Sarlat then general councilor.
He did not leave the room until 1919 or 23 years at the Bourbon Palace!
During this long career, the political position of Pierre Sarrazin has changed significantly.
The detractors of Pierre Sarrazin blame him especially for his inertia in the Chamber of Deputies.
It is true, however, that Dr. Sarrazin was not particularly present at the meeting.
He then fails in the senatorial elections of 1920 and the legislative elections of 1924.
In the end, Pierre Sarrazin's career is an example of political success.
Until the end, despite the failures, he retains the deep sympathy of the Sarladais.
He will have finally witnessed and acted a good part of the Third Republic.
Pierre Sarrazin was Knight of the Legion of Honor and Officer of Public Instruction.
"A politician from P√©rigord at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries: Pierre Sarrazin (1854-1931), deputy mayor of Sarlat.
This was true in the nineteenth and twentieth century and it remains true today.
IMT is renowned worldwide for its research on the AIDS virus, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases.
Annually, 500 doctors, veterinarians, biomedicals and nurses from all over the world attend the courses.
About a hundred young researchers are doing their doctoral thesis.
ITM also collaborates with many partner institutions in Africa, South America and Asia.
IMT was founded in 1906 in Brussels as a school of tropical medicine.
During the same period, in different European cities, especially port cities, similar institutions were also created.
Individuals and institutions make mistakes, especially in times of high tension.
In 1852, the family moved to Marlboro and Mendenhell became principal of a local elementary school in 1858.
He formalized his teaching skills at the Ecole Normale du Sud-Ouest in 1861 with the qualification of Instructor Normalis.
He also made a series of measurements of the solar spectrum wavelength with a large spectrometer.
The various wavelengths are used for a wide range of communications, from governments to radio listeners.
He began to take an interest in earthquakes and was one of the founders of Japan's seismological society.
Returning to Ohio in 1881, Mendenhall contributed to the development of the Ohio State Weather Service.
He designed a signal system for the railway.
This system was later generalized throughout the United States and also in Canada.
He was the first to establish stations in the United States for the observation of earthquakes.
Mendenhall remained a strong supporter of the adoption of this metric system all his life.
He was also responsible for defining the exact boundary between Alaska and Canada.
Mendenhall was president of the Polytechnic Institute of Worcester from 1894 to 1901 when he emigrated to Europe.
He continued to sit on the board until his death in Ravenna in 1924 at the age of 78.
In 1901, Mendenhall published one of his first works of stylometry, the technique of analyzing writing styles.
However, it was shown that Mendenhall did not take into account "gender differences" which invalidated his conclusions.
Polity data is a dataset widely used in the field of political science.
But science and data-based policies have a short half life at the UN.
Among other things, TRAMO-SEATS software is recommended by Eurostat for the correction of seasonal variations of short-term indicators.
TRAMO-SEATS uses parametric seasonal adjustment methods, which are based on seasonal ARIMA models and spectral analysis methods.
The series calculated by TRAMO-SEATS do not tend to be over-corrected.
The European University Institute in Florence provided support for the next seven years.
Members of the research committee include Edmond Malinvaud and Paul Champsaur.
Development has been facilitated by the collaboration of many national central banks and statistical institutes.

The era of big fish eating small fish is over.
On the two side wings, angels play musical instruments, five on each side.
The TransJurassienne Confirmation (CTJ) is a cross-border co-operation body that stirred up the duke of the Jurassian Frank-Swiss Arc.
Under the impetus, among others, the CTJ, the Jura Arc shows for several years a real dynamism.
It aims to strengthen economic and social cohesion, particularly important in times of crisis, in border areas.
This cross-border reality is generating challenges, particularly in terms of spatial planning and economic level.
Many concrete examples of successful collaboration testify to the intensity of cooperation and prove that the culture of dialogue works.
Community cohesion policy also encourages cross-border cooperation projects within the framework of the Interreg France-Switzerland program.
The CTJ is a cross-border cooperation body that operates across the Franco-Swiss Jura Arc.
Since 2005, the CTJ has moved towards a more structuring role of coordinating initiatives and discussion platform.
It has a role of reflection, impulse and support projects.
Its priorities are focused on economic development, transport, vocational training and sustainable development.
As a result, development will remain the top priority, especially the development of its own financial market.
The institutional organization of the CTJ is based on regular meetings of the Council, the Consultative Assembly, and the Bureau, the decision-making body.
The Office supports and defines the strategic orientations of the structure.
In 2011, the theme of the CTJ Council focused on training.
In 2009, the CTJ published a study to identify economic complementarities on the perimeter of the Jura Arc.
The French and Swiss territories of the Jura Arc share a growing common interest in preserving the environment and resources.
Since 2009, annual conferences have been organized so that partners can meet and work on cross-border actions.
His discovery played a pioneering role in the field of cave archeology in the Mayan civilization.
It was proposed in 2002 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
"Naj Tunich" means "stone house" in Maya mopan.
This name was given to him by one of the first visitors, an American linguist named Pierre Ventur.
The cave was discovered in 1979 by Maya Kekchi, Bernabe Pop, while hunting.
He revealed the existence to Mike De Vine, an American working as a guide in the locality of Popt√∫n.
In 1989, the cave was a victim of gratuitous vandalism, irreparably destroying twenty-three works of art.
During the pre-classical and classical periods, the cave was an important pilgrimage site for the Mayas.
But the other 30 sharp declines occurred during periods when prices were much more volatile.
The Mayans considered the caves as access to the Underworld or Xibalba.
Naj Tunich was the scene of many ritual activities, whether ritual bloodletting or child sacrifice.
A large number of paintings, drawings, inscriptions, handprints, artifacts and masonry constructions have been discovered.
Its steep slope was built by the Mayans who built low walls.
In the upper part a leveled terrace has been called the "Balcony".
It is in this area that we found the largest number of artifacts.
It is in these galleries that the rock art works are found.
The presidential election in South Korea was held on August 5, 1952, for the first time by universal suffrage.
This is a victory for Syngman Rhee who is reelected with 74.6% of the vote.
These elections took place during the Korean War, which contributed significantly to strengthening the position of Syngman Rhee.
His first operation was to gather his forces in a new party, the Liberal Party, created on December 19, 1951.
In established parties, the forces that promote rejuvenation are weak and uneven.
The Liberal Party chooses Syngman Rhee as presidential candidate and Lee Beom-seok as vice-president.
Syngman Rhee, chairman in office, is reappointed and will retain his post until 1960.
This ultimatum comes after several years of increasing tension between these two countries, catalyzed by Nazi propaganda in the region.
It is deposited only five days after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.
The United Kingdom and France follow their policy of appeasement, while Italy and Japan support German demands.
In the euro zone and the United Kingdom, fiscal policy is holding back growth.
The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Parliament of Klaipƒóda) is attached to Lithuania.
During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany maintained normal relations and were united behind a common anti-Polish sentiment.
However, tensions arise in the 1930s after the transformation of the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich.
A particularly tense period occurred in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested a dozen pro-Nazi militants.
This situation causes an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), farmers organize violent protests.
However, after the plebiscite in the Saar, most pro-Nazi prisoners are amnestied.
In the spring of 1938, Hitler declared that the acquisition of Klaipƒóda was one of his highest priorities, just after the annexation of the Sudetenland.
His points are deliberately vague, allowing Germany to accuse Lithuania of violations.

Thus the city took its name of "Mont d'Or".
It was not until 1348 that King Charles IV linked Silesia to the Bohemian Crownlands.
Until the end of the Second World War, she was German.
After the Second World War appeared a bipolar world order dominated by the US and the Soviet Union.
But in 1945, the Soviet Union linked Silesia and Goldberg to Poland.
The German population who had not fled the Russian advance was forcibly displaced west.
Estonia is the first European state to be declared "Judenfrei" (without Jews) by the Nazis.
In April 1992, the Association of Jewish Culture and the Jewish Religious Community became co-founders of the Jewish Community of Estonia.
He is the first rabbi in Estonia since the end of the Second World War.
But from the beginning, it is obvious that this transfer can only be a transitional solution.
The obvious solution to the euro crisis is a federal solution.
In addition, the community suffers from the absence of a "Mikve" (ritual bath) and kosher cooking.
The Jewish religious community in Estonia then decided to build a new synagogue on the land adjacent to the community center.
The facade of the building was to be a replica of the facade of the synagogue destroyed during the last war.
The new synagogue will bear the name of its mother, "Beila Barski".
On the instructions of the chief architect of Tallinn, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrebuilding the facade of the old synagogue must be abandoned.
Before cutting the red ribbon with the Estonian President, Shimon Peres made a speech:
The architecture of the synagogue is organized on the principle of the axis.
When entering the building, you enter the vestibule which can also be used as a conference room.
The staircase leading to the prayer room on the first floor can then serve as seating for 70 people.
The wall to the right of the entrance can turn into a projection screen during conferences.
On each side of the Ark, were placed the seats of the rabbi and important personalities of the community.
This allows to accommodate for offices, 105 men and 78 women.
During concerts, the hall can accommodate up to 230 people by adding seats.
The kitchen, on the ground floor, at the rear of the building, is equipped with the most modern utensils for kosher food preparation.
It is the first kosher restaurant in Tallinn since the Second World War.
The new Tallinn Synagogue is located at the corner of Karu Street and Aedvilja Street.
It completes the ensemble formed by the Jewish school and the community center.
During the construction of the synagogue, the inner courtyard of the complex was re-paved.
Vehbi Ko√ß is the founder of several private education and health institutions.
Vehbi Ko√ß began his career as manager of a grocery store that his father bought for him in Ankara in 1917.
In 1926 he submitted to the Ankara Chamber of Commerce the statutes of his first enterprise, "Ko√ßzade Ahmet Vehbi".
After the opening of branches in Istanbul and Eskisehir in 1938, Ko√ß grouped its companies into a single company, Ko√ß Ticaret A.≈û.
The powerful Turkish car industry and all its subcontractors were born from the initiatives taken by Vehbi Ko√ß at that time.
Vehbi Ko√ß again reconcentrated all his companies into the same cartel in 1963 to give birth to Ko√ß Holding A.≈û.
This concentration was a key moment in the economic growth of Turkey, which saw the birth of its first multinational companies.
Many large multinational companies, including oil companies, support this approach.
Today, its holding company is one of the 200 largest companies in the world.
The Daigaku-no kami of the imperial court was the head of the national education system.
The title was born during the government reorganizations started in 701 called "ritsury≈ç-sei" (Âæã‰ª§ Âà∂).
Like many other developments of the time, the title was an adaptation inspired by the government system of Tang China.
The post was usually reserved for a son or a relative of the emperor.
For example, in 773, the "daigaku-no-kami" was Yamabe "-shinn≈ç" who was the crown prince of Emperor K≈çnin.
During the time of Edo, the title the head of the education system of the government.
During the following years, this title becomes hereditary for the next ten generations.
The restorer of the "Yushima Seid≈ç" was at the top of the national education and training system created by the Tokugawa Shogunate.
This requires a good education and vocational training system, as well as the required infrastructure.
The position of Daigaku-no-kami will become hereditary in the Hayashi clan, as will the office of rector of the Edo Academy.
Daigaku-no-kami, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, would now be translated as "Head of the National University".
Native of the governorate of Jendouba in Tunisia, he obtains in 1993 the Belgian nationality.
Maaroufi is himself listed by the Security Council on the list of al-Qaeda sanctions on September 3, 2002.
He is sentenced to six years in prison.
Arrested in 2003, they were sentenced in 2005 to eight years in prison for tax evasion.
On March 24, 2012, following the general amnesty granted in Tunisia, he returned to his native country.
It also hosts the oldest ski infrastructure in the state.
The snow stays there until April and sometimes even later.
Nearly six months later, the sum of the damage remains difficult to gauge.
In 1954, the club began operations by signing a ten-year lease with local landowners.
The new station thus created is in fact a re-use of the original site on the "Weiss Knob".
In 1957, the state of West Virginia bought its first land with the initial idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping the ski economy.
In 1972, an 18-hole golf course was added for the leisure practice throughout the year.
The ski resort opens in 1971, on the original site of the estate "Weiss Knob".
It offers 39 trails, two snowparks and, since winter 2005-06, it has a site for the practice of airboard.
The park has a capacity of 250 rooms to accommodate skiers, as well as campsites for the summer.
It has many trails, mountain bike trails and a world-class golf course.
The Big Society was the flagship political idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe British Conservative election platform in 2010.
The great British political thinker of the 19th century, John Stuart Mill, advocated a liberal government without a multiparty system.
It is now part of the legislative agenda of the coalition agreement between conservatives and liberal democrats.
While some have welcomed this idea, its objectives have been questioned by other political commentators.
The Big Society concept only applies to politics in England.
The program includes the creation of a Big Society Bank and a national civic service.
The Big Society has some points in common with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsolidarity commitment ("rentmeesterschap") developed by the Dutch Christian Democrat party CDA.
Statistical science seems to exist from the birth of the first social structures.
Moreover, the first written texts found were livestock censuses, information on its course and various contracts.
In Europe, the role of collector is often held by merchant guilds and then by state stewards.
The Inca civilization (1400-1530) developed a positional numbering system in base 10 (so similar to the one used today).
Not knowing the writing, they used quipus to "write" the statistics of the state.
A quipu is an alignment whose strings have three types of knots symbolizing unity, ten and hundred, respectively.
Antoine Deparcieux wrote in 1746 the "Essay on the probabilities of the human life".
It will first serve the life insurance companies that are created then.
Many life insurance companies and banks have been hit hard by low interest rates.
Statistics is also a support for the prospective or retrospective history of demography in particular.
Florence Nightingale is a pioneer in the visual presentation of information.
It uses among other things the circular charts, the "Pie Chart", developed by William Playfair in 1801.
Subsequently, Nightingale conducts a comprehensive statistical survey of the health system in the Indian countryside.
It is becoming the major figure of improving medical care and public health services in India and England.
Methods of improving the quality of the public service may remain unknown for years.
The mathematical statistics were based on the first work on the probabilities developed by Fermat and Pascal.
It was probably in Thomas Bayes that an embryo of inferential statistics appeared.
Condorcet and Laplace still spoke of probability where today we speak of frequency.
But it is to Adolphe Quetelet that we owe the idea that statistics is a science based on probabilities.
It was not until 1901 to see the first general version appear by Liapounov.
It is also in this treatise that the Laplace method appears for the asymptotic evaluation of certain integrals.
Specific rules on the collection and interpretation of data were enacted.
Ludwig Boltzmann mathematically formalizes in 1872 the evolution of a low-density gas out of equilibrium.
These statistical considerations are the first fruits of the establishment of statistical physics.
The Nazi regime used statistical methods from 1934 for rearmament.
During the century, several currents of thought will confront each other:

Juan Jos√© Torres joined the Argentine Artillery School in 1941 at the age of 21.
He later became chief of staff, military attach√© in Brazil and ambassador to Uruguay.
But his government is not stable because supported by a minority of the army and the middle class of the country.
For most middle-class people in developed countries, their home is their most valuable asset.
A strong middle class emerged in the advanced countries and then began to appear elsewhere.
He is forced into exile in Argentina when right-wing colonel Hugo Banzer overthrows him.
Ethel Gray Terry, later a graduate of the Roxbury Academy, begins as a classical dancer at the age of two.
Then she starts on Broadway in a few plays as an actress.
She joined Hollywood in 1914 where she played mostly women of high society.
Women are the fabric of society, especially in the poorest countries.
From 1922, her career declined, although she was still the partner of William S. Hart at that time.
She died in 1931 as a result of an illness she suffered for a year.
Rita Tornborg, born Rita Albihn on December 13, 1926 in Johannesburg (South Africa) is a Swedish writer and literary critic.
A Polish mother and a Swedish father, she spent her early childhood in South Africa.
She graduated from the Polish High School in Stockholm and started studying zoology at Lund University.
In her novels she depicts the life and integration of Jewish immigrants from central and eastern Europe into Sweden.
Most Central and Eastern European countries do not want this change.
It is time for the rest of Central and Eastern Europe to catch up with Serbia.
Rita Tornborg is the author to date of six novels and a collection of short stories.
In 1974 she obtained a travel grant from the Swedish Writers' Fund.
In 2005, a documentary directed by Stanis≈Çaw Kubiak was devoted to him by Polish television
To date, no translation into English of Rita Tornborg's work has been published.
One of his novels ("St. Solomon") has been translated into Polish:
- "Names of Solomon" (titre original "Salomos namsdag"), traduit du su√©dois par Leonard Neuger, Literary publishing house, Cracovia 1993
The famine of 1899 in central Kenya is a devastating disaster entered Kenya's history.
With famine, there is an epidemic of smallpox, which depopulates entire regions.
All people living in the affected areas have been affected, to varying degrees.
South of the Ngong Mountains and west of the Aberdare Mountains are also Kikuyu, Okiek and Maasai.
Their languages ‚Äã‚Äãare, apart from the Maa, Nilotic, Bantu languages, and consequently closely related.
Maasai membership, for example, can change by moving or changing the food economy, such as the move from livestock to agriculture.
People live much more in small communities, in clans, in associations of families or villages.
Such groups can even be formed between people of different linguistic backgrounds.
The quarrels between different units within the same linguistic group are as frequent as between units of different groups.
However, these small communities remain in close contact, even across language barriers.
The rich highlands serve as an attic for the entire region.
In much of East Africa, the 1880s and 1890s were periods of erratic and insufficient rainfall.
The first attempts of the British Empire to gain a foothold in Kenya were not without consequences on the catastrophes.
For this purpose, large quantities of food are purchased, sometimes stolen, from the surrounding population.
Caravan traffic also promotes the spread of previously unknown diseases, such as rinderpest.
The influence of the British, however, remains weak, and is limited to a few stations and their immediate surroundings.
Only by the construction of the railway will this change.
The deeper the line penetrates, the easier it is for Europeans to reach the inside.
The number of Europeans in the country then explodes: settlers and officials, missionaries, adventurers, businessmen and scientists flock.
For Africans, the construction of the railway has yet another dimension.
Since the beginning of construction in 1896, it has attracted many African workers to gigantic construction sites.
Most of the workers on the track are Indian contractors, but Africans from all over East Africa also work there.
These workers, mostly male, are missing on their farms, which further reduces the harvest.
The year 1898 begins with nine more months and we make it adapt to the southern regions.
By the middle of 1898, many people were starving.
That year, the rain comes very late, and falls again in smaller quantities than usual.
Finally, the crops dry on the eastern side of the highlands and south of the Kikuyu region.
By mid-1898, the lack of food had not yet spread to all of Central Kenya.
Knowing whether food trade is really a cause of lack of food is still an open question.
The well-watered highlands between Mount Kenya and the Nyandarua Mountains have remained sheltered from famine.
In 1898, the construction of the railway approached the territory of Kamba and the highlands.
Their milk and blood provide food without delay or effort.
Occasionally, marriages are declared null, in order to be able to claim the return of the cattle which has been given in dot.
In other cases, young girls are hurriedly married to introduce livestock into the family.
However, trade trips to the uplands to buy food are risky.
They last for several days, for which provisions are needed, and you have to cross tumultuous rivers.
In many places gangs of thieves are doing their evil business, attacking travelers and stripping them of their goods.
Often travelers weakened by hunger do not reach their goal and die en route.
Survivors try to survive famine as agricultural labor on these still productive lands.
Africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs.
A decisive survival strategy is the pledging of women and girls.
In addition to women, family or village groups migrate from areas of famine.
They experience the backs of refugees, their wives and children are often abused or abducted.
Unfortunately, in many places social structures and moral bonds give way.
Even the closest relationships tear apart, to free themselves from responsibilities and save their own lives.
Brothers are flying, men are abandoning their families, mothers are their children.
In a small isolated hut in Kamba territory, missionaries found 24 dead children, who were closely intertwined.
Other children roam alone, or with their siblings, or in larger groups, and seek protection and food.
Young men and even women gather in gangs to live looting.
They attack small or large caravans, or homes that for lack of men are no longer protected.
Roving bands of marauders make life in sparsely populated areas increasingly dangerous.
Smallpox affects both the hungry and the well-fed.
Some companies, such as the Embus, completely forbid foreigners access to their territory, to limit the spread of smallpox.
Dans of other regions, however, wherever they would refuse to soign the ills.
The administration stations of the colonial power which is established and those of the Missions use the situation to reinforce their influence.
After the completion of the path, stations and mission centers are growing at an accelerated rate.
The Europeans who reside there had often complained before of a lack of workers to maintain their stations.
Migrant workers preferred to work for the construction of the railway because it was better fed and paid for.
At the same time begins an aid program organized by the administration and the missions, and financed by the British government.
Space exploration programs funded by governments around the world have been a source of inspiration.
However, they do not mean the end of famine yet.
For some regions, this period is precisely a period of suffering.
Although the famine is not immediately stopped by the rain, the supply situation is improving relatively rapidly.
A few weeks later, the survivors can return their first harvests.
All attempts to quantify the number of victims are based on very imprecise estimates.
She gives that among 71 adult men, 24 had not survived the famine.
Rather, they are descriptions of personal impressions of European observers that give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe number of victims.
You can not go for a walk without falling on corpses.
People are organized rather in small scattered homes, and no longer in fairly large communities grouped around a patriarch.
It is thus easier to feed all the members of a family with the ground which one has.
But because of the many deaths, we could not go to the fields.
We could see a squash or a calabash, but we could not catch it because it was growing on a pile of corpses.
After these bitter experiences, many people preferred to leave the semi-arid lowland steppes.
This will make it more difficult for herders to recolonize and reform a local livestock economy in these areas.
Trials will continue before the courts in the 1930s, for encroachments dating back to that time.
Before the famine, interest in Christianity was very low, which had been disappointing for the missions.
The scattered small scattered households identify themselves less and less with the small companies that existed previously.
This is largely land that has been depopulated by death and emigration during the famine.
As a result of the famine, community relations are changing dramatically in central Kenya.
The Kikuyus are developing a position more and more hostile to the Maasai.
In the Embu, the villages tried to defend themselves against refugee immigrants.
This often becomes very difficult, because women are often reluctantly surrendered.
In many cases, they have already been married, in other cases sold as slaves.
The real importance of famine for the African population was only recognized by scientific research from around 1950.
The famine has therefore been interpreted as the punishment for a fault committed.
Decades after the famine, the survivors are still reluctantly and reluctantly talking about their memories of that time.
This painful period of famine is anchored to this day in the collective memory of Kenyans.
Kawakami Sumio is an engraver of figures, cityscapes, still lifes, illustrator and painter of fixed-under-glass.
He never receives any formal artistic education and considers himself an amateur painter.
Of an independent and taciturn character, his contacts with the artistic world and avant-garde movements of the pre-war period are infrequent.
His isolation does not prevent him from painting and writing poems that he illustrates.
What motivates people to write poems, paint or sing?
In 1958, at the age of sixty-three, he became a professional artist.
His early works already influenced some of his contemporaries, notably Shik≈ç Munakata, the most famous engraver of his time.
To consider these various works, it is impossible to discern then, a country in the midst of an international war.
The General Organization of Eurovision Fans (OGAE) is an international organization gathering fans of the Eurovision Song Contest.
The organization is structured into a network of forty national branches spread across Europe and the world.
Each year, the OGAE organizes three competitions mobilizing the branches of the network and crowning their favorite songs.
OGAE was founded in 1984 in Savonlinna, Finland, by Jari-Pekka Koikkalainen, now an honorary member of the Finnish branch.
The organization took the form of a non-governmental, apolitical and non-profit fan club, structured as an international network.
Do Multinationals, International Non-Governmental Organizations and Multilateral Lenders Really Understand Local Needs?
It is expected that local and international non-governmental organizations will fill the gaps.
Each branch of the network consists of a national fan club, located in one of the countries participating (or having participated) in the competition.
Soon, the OGAE became the largest fan organization of Eurovision.
From 2002, each national branch elected an international coordinator to represent it at an annual meeting.
Until then, the organization had remained informal and had no specific legal status.
In 2009, in Moscow, international presidents and coordinators decided to create a formal legal entity: "OGAE International".
OGAE also organizes three non-profit competitions every year:
The current composition of the Permanent Bureau of OGAE is as follows:
At present, OGAE Rest of the World brings together fans from thirty-seven countries:
In 2002 and 2003, the members of the OGAE awarded one of the three Marcel-Bezen√ßon Prizes: the "Fan Prize".
From 2004, this prize was replaced by the "Prize for the best composition", awarded by the participating composers.
Since 2007, the OGAE organizes, in the weeks preceding the competition, an opinion poll.
As in the competition, the national branches can not vote for their own country.
These countries have proven that they can abandon their own monetary policies without serious tensions.
The "OGAE Song Contest" is an audio music competition in which all national branches of the OGAE can participate.
Each branch submits an original song, published in his country during the last twelve months.
This song must be interpreted in one of the official languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the country.
The "OGAE Second Chance Competition" is an annual video competition founded in 1987.
Each concerned national branch submits a song in the running during the said selection, but not having won it.
At the same time, a retrospective competition is held each year, covering the years prior to 1987.
The "OGAE Video Contest" is a video music competition in which all national branches of the OGAE can participate.
Each branch submits an original video clip, published in their country in the last twelve months.
Unlike the song competition OGAE, the song should not be interpreted in one of the official languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the country.
He will later say that it is because of a sentence of Jean-Paul Sartre that he began writing.

Le Monde musical is a musical magazine founded in 1889 by the piano man Edouard Mangeot (1835-1898).
This magazine disappeared at the beginning of the Second World War.
At the end of the Second World War, Nazi leaders fled to different countries of the world.
In the wake of the Second World War, the national interests of European countries were aligned.
Sunland and Tujunga were originally inhabited by the Tongvas, an Amerindian people.
The word Tujunga means "place of the old woman" in the language Tongva now extinct.
In 1887 the Monte Vista Hotel was used as a post office.
At the office, the first person to use Vista was the vice president of the company.
From 1906, the name Sunland was used by the Los Angeles Times instead of Monte Vista.
Most of Sunland was annexed to Los Angeles in 1926.
Academic Solange Cruveille adds a fifth case with "filial piety".
When there is not enough food, people are starving.
It is better to let half of the population die so that the other half can eat enough.
Half of the population, especially children, do not have enough to eat.
The latter accused Liu of "letting go of the class enemy".
History will hold our two names and cannibalism will be in the books.
Gilles van Grasdorff reports on this, his writings in "The fifth modernization and other writings of the Peking Spring":
Cannibalism was also practiced in some places during the Cultural Revolution.
This is particularly the case in Guangxi, but also in southern Hunan.
The result of this investigation published under the title of "" is overwhelming for the local authorities, who let it go.
The most popular human parts are "the brain, the heart, the intestines, the uterus and especially the liver".
The classic novel "At the edge of water" presents several scenes of cannibalism.
Chinese artist Zhu Yu worked on cannibalism in 2001.
A documentary of the BBC presenting his work caused a stir in Great Britain.
The film deals with the judicial system operated by the Israeli armed forces in the West Bank.

In the long term, a global trade agreement will not be valid without India's participation.
This earned him the prize of the beginners of the association of photographic critics of Japan.
Since 1997, the city of Tsuwano has a museum devoted largely to the work of Kuwabara.
Until March 2004, the museum is called "Photographic Documentary Museum of Tsuwano"; then it is renamed "Shisei Kuwabara Photographic Museum".
In this context, he works in many countries of the world.
Many other countries, mainly in the developing world, are also considering adopting nuclear energy.
Half of the world's countries are democracies, yet none of the 22 Arab countries.

The Translation and the Letter or the Inn of the Faraway is a book of Antoine Berman, published in 1991.
In order to illustrate this distinction, he will use the example of proverbs, where this distinction is not always clear.
The point is that translation is a reflection that goes beyond the simple search for equivalence.
The problem is simple: All research is based on previous research.
Berman wants to escape from the traditional couple theory / practice to replace him with experience (Heideggerian meaning) and reflection.
Translation can be an experience of reflection and reflection about the translation experience.

They will be able to fight Lord Xandred and the forces of the World below.
Only the five Power Rangers, led by their leader, the Red Samurai Ranger, will be able to handle it.
Families who can no longer cope with their home loans will lose their homes.
But they are not at the end of their surprises in this fight against evil.
They appeared on Earth a long time ago but their attack was repelled by powerful Samurai.
They sail on the Sanzu River that fills up when people are scared.
They need this water to live because they react badly to the contact of our air.
In 1873, the bank moved its headquarters from Darmstadt to Berlin.
She took over the Breslauer Disconto-Bank with 19 branches in 1913.
En 1920, la "Darmstadt Bank for Trade and Industry" and "National Bank for Germany" forment la "Banking Community Darmst√§dter National Bank Berlin".
The two banks have the mutual guarantee of capital and reserves of more than one billion marks.
The merger of the two banks was completed in 1922 under the name "Darmst√§dter und Nationalbank", abbreviated "Danat Bank".
This created one of the largest commercial banks in the Weimar Republic.
Commercial banks that hold a large amount of government bonds from weakened countries have become potentially insolvent.
In 1931 Danatbank was the second largest bank in Germany.
By order of the Imperial Government, the Darmst√§dter und Nationalbank then merged with Dresdner Bank.
The victorious powers of the First World War did not intervene.
For Georgia, the situation was hardly different: the heart of the country was however spared.
Georgia has an embassy in Ankara and two consulates in Istanbul and Trabzon.
Turkey maintains an embassy in Tbilisi and a consulate in Batumi.
Georgia and Turkey occupy a strategic place between the southern Caspian oil regions and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, opened in 2005, crosses the two countries as well as the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline.
Both countries are founding members of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization.
The OECD, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, has taken over.
Turkey has become Georgia's largest trading partner for both imports and exports.
Turkey is for the country the only land access to Europe.
Turkey is certainly not the only country whose policy has been misinterpreted by the financial markets.
Teams from Georgia and Turkey are usually in the European federation.
The athletes also compete in the national sports that are the sports of fighting or strength: wrestling, boxing, judo, weightlifting
TaraTari is a shipyard created in 2004 by Yves Marre in Bangladesh.
They turn their barge into a floating hospital for isolated populations in the north of the country.
In 2004, Yves met Marc Van Peteghem, co-director of the naval architecture firm Van Peteghem Lauriot-Pr√©vost (VPLP).
They are an effective solution to improve working conditions and preserve the lives of fishermen in Bangladesh.
In 2010, TaraTari convinced the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the need to improve Bangladesh's fleet.
The organization then relies on the yard for the production of the first 25 fiberglass fishing boats in the country.
(35 units produced), develops new boats for the A.K.
Khan and starts new projects for better use of the country's waterways.
In 2014 a partnership with a local industrial group is planned.
TaraTari supports those who wish to develop innovative projects for Bangladesh around water.
TaraTari provides a repair and maintenance service for all fiberglass ships.
The first ship out of the yard is the Emirates Hospital Catamaran.
The shipyard, through its director Yves Marre, is very involved in safeguarding the naval heritage of Bangladesh.
TaraTari has participated in the construction of missing ships to preserve the legacy of this large traditional fleet.
Examples include Malar, Panchi, Patham, Shampan, Baich and Shampan.
Currently, many shipyards produce boats (wood, steel and now composite) often poorly adapted and fragile.
TaraTari wishes to accompany Bangladesh by training technicians to make safe and sustainable boat construction possible.
These vessels aim to improve the living and working conditions of the local population.
Since 2002, several initiatives have aimed to improve the lives of women in Afghanistan.
Koll graduated from law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
I obtained a law degree to be able to advocate for members of my community.
She later earned a master's degree and a doctorate in law from Columbia University.
She founded the People's University, which offers free university courses taught by students at Tel Aviv University.
She entered the Knesset after the party won 19 seats.
In 2004, she has six pastors, including Waldau and Helge Fossmo.
The murder took place around 4:00 am on January 10, 2004.
Alexandra is alone in the marriage bed, Helge sleeping that night in the children's room.
Sara Svensson shoots the housewife twice, hitting her with a bullet in the head.
When the neighbor opens, he is also shot in the head.
After announcing to the pastor the death of his wife, the police asked him if anyone could blame him.
We also note that the footprints left by the killer in the snow are of size.
When questioned by the investigators, she immediately admitted to being the author of the shots.
After the confession of the murderer, arises for the investigators the question of mobile, and a possible complicity.
Helge Fossmo and his neighbor meet each other several times a day, exchanging romantic messages via SMS.
The morning of the murder, at the precise time of the events, she also called the same number.
The police are organizing a press conference, which is like a media bomb.
Amnesty International organized a press conference on the subject in Baghdad in July 2003.
In the spring of 2004, police interrogated Sara Svensson many times.
Technicians solicited by the police are however able to recover some of these SMS in the phone memory.
Helge Fossmo est nor √† Pori Forest prides the Kristinehamn and 1971.
His parents, both of whom are Norwegian, divorce quickly, and his father returns to Norway.
He moved away from the Pentecostal church for a time, but returned in 1993 with the help of √Ösa Waldau.
In 1997, Fossmo moved to Knutby with his wife and two children.
He works alongside Waldau, and gradually imposes himself in the community, becoming pastor, then representative of the parish.
In 1999, he learns that he has diabetes, then falls seriously ill, but the doctors he consults do not detect anything abnormal.
And December 18, 1999, this prophecy is realized: the wife of Fossmo is actually found dead in his bathtub.
Police conduct a routine investigation, which concludes to an accidental death.
The young woman would have slipped, and her head would have hit the hot water faucet.
But it was around the same time that his relationship with Sara Svensson began.
Fossmo, who continues to complain of various pains, hires the young woman in particular to provide various care.
Svensson moved to the home of the Fossmo, where she will reside for several years.
Quickly, Helge Fossmo and Svensson make common room, while Alexandra Fossmo sleeps on his side.
Helge Fossmo embarks on a psychological manipulation of Svensson, transforming her into a slave.
On November 8, 2003, Sara Svensson attacks Alexandra Fossmo with a hammer.
The trial opens on May 18, 2004 in the court of Uppsala.
The charges are murder and attempted murder for Sara Svensson, and incitement to a double murder for Helge Fossmo.
Fossmo also compared for the murder of his first wife in 1999.
When asked about SMS, he says he simply wanted to "help God a little".
Helge Fossmo is acquitted for the murder of his first wife in 1999.
The young woman is sentenced to psychiatric detention.
The proximity of Stockholm allows editorial teams of major national media to send reporters on site for a reasonable cost.
Journalists in particular find in the small Pentecostal community a source of renewed interest.
Former members, who had chosen to leave the parish, are put forward.
But after the media rush, comes for the media time for self-criticism.
A law school is a higher education institution for the teaching of law.
Over the last twenty years, nearly 700 higher education institutions from all continents have signed it.
Health Services and Military Medicine during the American Civil War
In both camps, very active charities supported, sometimes significantly, the efforts of the military health services.
Thomas Lawson, then "Surgeon General", had not taken advantage of it to obtain, for his service, more means or consideration.
Numerous organizations were created, in the North as in the South, to provide for the material and moral needs of the soldiers.
Systematic fundraising campaigns were organized to educate citizens and they raised millions of dollars.
Several thousand volunteers served hospitals and nursing homes.
An inspection service, pharmaceutical laboratories and medical stewardship completed the scheme.
Quite late, an ambulance corps was established and attached to the Medical Service.
A local or regional hierarchical level (hospital doctor-inspector) could intervene between them and the "Surgeon General".
Stanton took the opportunity to remove Hammond, who was dismissed in disgraceful conditions on August 18, 1864.
The officers of the Medical Service formed part of the staff of the armies.
They were not assigned to a particular regiment or command, but were detached as needed.
The newly recruited doctors were first known as the Brigade Surgeons (Brigade Surgeon).
From that date, they were assimilated to the regular medical staff and became eligible for the same functions.
More medical and non-medical personnel are needed to manage these centers.
The Congress then specified these provisions as and when necessary, as, for example, with the text voted on April 16, 1862.
The organization continued to evolve during the war, depending on resources and needs, but always in a very hierarchical way.
He could begin before attending classes and continuing long after completing them.
The theoretical instruction was based on seven subjects that the student first approached in a five-month course.
The war severely tested the theoretical knowledge and the civilian experience of the medical profession.
In action, he was accompanied by an aide carrying a backpack, containing the necessary first aid.
It was replaced in 1862 by a more compact model, with drawers and weighing more than double.
Various models of medical vans were then specifically designed to transport pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.
These endowments were regularly replenished by the intendants who accompanied each army.
At the end of the conflict, the medical van model built and used by the military was the Autenrieth model.
The material needed by the medical profession was provided by the government.
The first case contained what was needed for heavy surgeries (amputations, trepanations, resections).
Regimental hospitals and general hospitals also had dentistry equipment.
Contrary to popular belief, and except in exceptional cases, most painful procedures were performed under anesthesia.
The use of stimulants such as alcohol before or after anesthesia was the subject of medical controversy throughout the war.
These apprehensions may partly explain why some operations were performed without anesthesia.
Despite the empiricism of practitioners, they reveal a remarkably low proportion of anesthetic accidents.
In 1876, the Surgeon General Office took steps to have its information collected the following year each quarter.
Even if these figures may appear incomplete, the huge number of injured guarantees the relevance of statistical operations.
The light wounded were examined and dressed at the first grouping point.
More serious injuries were stabilized and the patient was transported as far as possible to the field hospital.
The first dressing consisted of a simple gauze, held in place by a bandage and soaked with water.
Practitioners were aware that these cases were due to the lack of hygiene surrounding the reception, accommodation and handling of the wounded.
Observing in their hospitals the contagious character of its manifestations, they called it "hospital gangrene".
The Confederates were affected in probably identical proportions, but with a mortality rate that seems lower.
It was not uncommon for a newly formed regiment to have one third of its strength in the infirmary.
Many general hospitals, in the North as in the South, were built for the occasion, and organized in units ("pavilions").
They were arranged in rows separated by streets or cartwheel plans.
Most general hospitals had a chapel, sometimes a library.
Some had a kitchen garden, a poultry yard and a dairy, which the convalescents took care of.
Some general hospitals were reserved for officers, others specialized in certain pathologies.
The organization of the system should be under the supervision of the Medical Service.
An ambulance body must be created and put into operation immediately.
Doctors, charities and inventors competed ingeniously throughout the war to offer improved models.
Inspired by models of seats, packs or cacolets used by European armies in their most recent engagements.
Various medical commissions had reviewed or proposed ambulance models, but their recommendations had not been followed up.
The car has 51 berths and a seat at each end for a caregiver.
It is equipped with a stove on which you can prepare the soup, a water tank, a cloakroom and convenient toilets.
These wagons can be hooked up to convoys of passengers and thus bring to Philadelphia serious wounds. "
Various variants were used throughout the war, some with a kitchen car, a pharmacy wagon, and so on.
On the Confederate side, a sanitary convoy was put into circulation in January 1863 between Chattanooga and Atlanta.
In April 1862, the tests being conclusive, they were joined by the "D.
A. January ", then, the needs increasing, by the" Empress ", the" Imperial ", the" Stephen Decatur ", the" J.
S. Pringel "and ships sent by different states, thus constituting a fleet capable of transporting thousands of men.
Most of the ships thus temporarily chartered were returned to civilian life after the operation, leaving the "D.
A. January "was rebuilt, with special attention to kitchens, ventilation and temperature control.
Like the entire organization of the Medical Service, that of transport by boat improved with experience.
They also timidly approached the psychological dimension of the conflict by describing the "nostalgic" syndromes that hit the contingent.

In Gen√®ve, he is rejoining to hear him "Via Valdesi" selling from Piedmont, in the northwest of Italy.
Initiated by German municipalities, the project was financed by the European LEADER fund.
Public projects financed by this fund would generate gains that are efficient enough to attract private financing.
The Book of Mormon presents the story of four civilizations that have all flourished in America:
The official position of the Church is limited to three dogmas:
With the exception of the elephant and the mysterious curelom and cumom, all these animals existed in the United States at the time of Joseph Smith.
Horses are mentioned eleven times in the parts of the Book of Mormon concerning the New World.
Mormon apologists have proposed different explanations for dealing with this supposed anachronism.
Elephants are mentioned twice in a verse from the Book of Mormon, the Jeddah story.
A very small mammoth population survived on St. Paul Island (Alaska) until 3700 BC.
Also, there is currently no archeological evidence that the American bison was once domesticated.
Apologist John L. Sorenson, on the other hand, says that sheep's wool has been found in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
The Book of Mormon suggests that pork existed and was domesticated among the Jaredites (Ether 9:18).
There is no rest, reference, illustration, tool or any other evidence suggesting that pork has been present in pre-Columbian America.
Some apologists assume that the word "pork" means peccary, an American animal that looks like pork.
On the other hand, critics refute that there is no archeological evidence that peccaries have ever been domesticated.
There is nothing to indicate that silk was produced or used in pre-Columbian America.
As for neon and shea, these plants have never been identified.
Palynology provides a large amount of information related to the environment in which human groups of the past evolved.
It is therefore possible for archaeologists to verify with confidence whether a plant was present or not in the past.
Archaeologists have found no evidence to suggest the existence of vehicles in pre-Columbian America.
The Inca civilization in South America shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles as in Mesoamerica.
The Inca roads were used mainly by Chaski runners and llama caravans.
Apologists emphasize that pre-Columbian wheeled toys indicate that the wheel was known by Native American peoples.
The "zif" is also a used metal (Mosiah 11: 3), but this word is in an unknown language.
The pre-Columbian peoples have always used the metal found in the natural state: copper, silver, gold and meteoric iron.
The metal found was struck cold to take the desired form and make a few rare valuables.
In America, Metallurgy (cast iron and alloy) developed from Peru and Bolivia.
The oldest archaeological trace of cast iron comes from copper slags dating between 900 and 700 BC.
Metallurgy spread to Panama and Costa Rica around 300-500 AD.
The Book of Mormon mentions dozens of times the use of swords and scimitars.
As for the sword, no sword was found in pre-Columbian America.
Chapter Alma 11 describes the use of a monetary system by the Nephites.
But the money fund was not just a monetary system; it was also a reform strategy.
Different gold and silver coins were produced with a fixed value in barley:
This system was established by King Mosiah (around 100 BC).
and other systems were in place during previous generations (Alma 11: 4).
The story shows that senine was still used as a unit of payment in the time of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 12:26).
This description resembles North and South America, separated by Central America.
Maps drawn by early Mormons identified the land of Abundance with Central America.
Mormon scholars now agree that the story concerns only peoples in a small area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAmerica.
Both concentrated in Ohio, they are part of the Mound Builders of the Silviculture period.
The NWAF is particularly interested in the pre-classical period (-2500 to +200), the period of the Book of Mormon.
Finally, Sorenson and others believe that the pre-classical Mayas are the Nephites / Lamanites and the Olmecs are the Jaredites.
This model is not only rejected by non-Mormon archaeologists, but some Mormons criticize it themselves.
Finally, it is important to note that the Maya have left many writings engraved on the stelae and temples.
These writings tell their story: dates, lists of kings, rituals and many other important events.
Mayans can read his writings today and nothing matches the Book of Mormon.
For example, we learn that Teotihuacan took control of the Mayan land in 378.
The least disadvantage of this procedure was that it made uncertain the forecast of dates, unstable and inconsistent contracts, claims and leases.
What was new, more than the calendar itself, was the civil and legal procedure it instituted.
It has been known for a long time that the tropical year lasted 365 days and about ¬º of a day.
Thus the average duration of the year of the Julian calendar is:
The result - the average - is the average length of detention.
The difference between the Julian year and the tropical year is not negligible.
People do not like to change their schedules and they have a long life.
The most spectacular Gregorian reform was to tune the calendar and the Sun by shifting the 10-day calendar.
Thus, in Rome, the day after October 4, 1582, was October 15, 1582.
Of course, this new method was itself only an approximation of the tropical year.
The revised Julian calendar was presented by scholar Milutin Milankoviƒá at the Pan-Orthodox Synod of Constantinople in May 1923.
The revised Julian calendar will be one day ahead of the Sun in 31541 years.
The EU's external trade is exclusive of trade between European countries.
So far, less than 2% of Maghreb trade is confined to the region.
It represents 15% of world trade in goods, 22.5% of world trade in services.
Intra-regional trade represents 64% of total EU trade in 2010.
Their survival being difficult, the increase of the population constituted an additional difficulty because of the scarcity of food.
In the Old Testament, Onan's sin is interpreted as an outrage to the Creator.
Power relations are established between human groups, formed in political entities.
The number then becomes an element of power: it makes it possible to overwhelm the intruder.
Thus, the prophet Jeremiah makes it say to Yahweh, "I make them prolific, they will not decline.
Nevertheless driven by famine, the Hebrews seek asylum in Egypt, and settle in the Nile Delta.
Their number became a threat to the Pharaoh, who decided on the infanticide of the male newborns.
Under Moses' guidance, the Hebrews return to Canaan, the promised land.
God then commands Moses to count the people and their goods.
Let's go up and take the country; we will certainly succeed in submitting it. "
Hippocrates repeatedly mentions abortive methods, including the use of copper sulphate.
Many cases of abandonment of newborns are identified and this practice is also regulated in Sparta in a eugenic spirit.
However, infertility is not desired and marriage is even encouraged, financial penalties being provided against singles.
Despite their notorious differences, Plato and Aristotle, who have been interested in the overpopulation debate, have similar positions.
Plato will evoke it in his two greatest dialogues, "The Republic" and "The Laws".
The second dialogue, "The Laws", is conceived as a set of proposals for a concrete application.
He is also less concerned about the lack of resources that would be generated by overcrowding than by maintaining order.
A city with too much population, according to him, is ungovernable and promotes crime as well as the usurpations of the rights of the city.
This understaff puts her in danger compared to her neighbors.
With the conquest of Greece, Hellenic ideas spread: the Romans adopted the Greek model of low birth rate.
The rich and the intellectuals who can afford it flee crowding for the benefit of the countryside.
This policy will be a failure and will fail to reverse the behaviors.
Also, according to the Roman historian Dion Cassius, the Seneca philosopher would have initiated his student Nero to sodomy.
In Rome, the exposure of newborns was practiced, as a last resort, until the prohibition of infanticide by Constantine in 315.
Before Christianization, the cultural context of the Roman Empire remains unfavorable to fertility.
Hellenistic philosophy, represented by Neoplatonism, Epicureanism and Stoicism, has a strong influence on the Romans.
In 391, Theodosius made Christianity the official and obligatory religion of the Empire.
Later, the Roman emperor of the East Justinian will complete the suppression of the laws of Augustus.
", Thus warning against a depopulation of Europe, thus making it vulnerable to new invasions.
This portrait therefore suggests that he can hardly apologize for a state he refuses for himself and his apostles.
But Jesus answered him who said to him, "Who are my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then, extending his hand on his disciples, he said, "Here is my mother and my brothers."
Currents of thought, which St. Augustine lists in his "Book of Heresies", also oppose procreation.
The latter, with St. Jerome and Epiphanius, unequivocally condemned the interrupted coitus.
Indeed, the tax documents counted not individuals but fires, that is to say family homes as a whole.
In France, the "State of the parishes and fires", realized in 1328, constitutes the only enumeration of the whole kingdom.
The Europe of 1300 is overpopulated in relation to its productive capacities.
Later, the Black Death will kill between 30 and 50% of the European population, between 1347 and 1352.
All the space between the city of Toulouse and the Col de M√©rens could not contain these.
Some currents of medieval literature criticize marriage, seen as a contract imposed on two beings who do not love each other.
Entering orders is therefore a way to keep an active role within the Church.
Religious life was also a loophole for women, who were forcibly married, who feared each new pregnancy.
The context of crusades allowed to observe the demography of the Muslim world.
While Urbain II considered Christianity overcrowded, the Crusaders insist on the importance of the Arab population.
"Just as at the beginning Abraham pleased God by marriage, now virgins are pleased by chastity.
He served the law of his time, we serve the law of our time, on which the end of the world arrives.
A prominent figure of the scholastics, Thomas d'Aquin, witness of the strong demographic growth, is favorable to a moderate growth of the population.
Populations with rapid population growth are also young because of the large number of children per household.
Aristotle's commentary commentaries have the cause of the sedition that impoverishes impoverishment to the poor and to the surpopulation.
The means of limiting the population advised by Aristotle during antiquity, however, face the Christian moral constraints of the Middle Ages.
Statistical studies are multiplying, sometimes at the request of European sovereigns, and often answering for ideological purposes.
In 1538, the King of England Henry VIII prescribed the strict keeping of these registers.
Christendom is indeed divided, fragmented into rival kingdoms, the number being seen as a force.
The seizure of absolute monarchies over the national churches will eventually lead the religious power to rally to populationism.
On the other hand, he deplores depopulation and the resulting degeneration.
Other theorists go in the direction of a populationism, like Antoine de Montchrestien, Nicolas Barnaud or Andr√© Du Chesne.
With the exception of utopian writers, England fears over-population, which can be attributed to the island mentality of its inhabitants.
The English, aware of the limits imposed by a space as small as theirs, fear the lack of resources.
But given the limited resources and lack of teachers, too many children are left behind.
Yet the impression of overpopulation exists and is inherent in new farming patterns.
The agricultural laborers, then reduced to unemployment, go to the cities where they beg and wander.
These departures cause, in the cities, a feeling of overpopulation, the latter being assimilated to impoverishment.
Several health and social events have been attributed to too much population growth during the modern era.
In southern Europe, in the kingdom of Spain Philip II experienced between 1500 and 1600 an important population boom.
However, this relative overpopulation of Spain is also at the origin of the sharp rise in prices under the Golden Century.
However, the difference in fertility rates between Calvinist and Catholic countries is not significant.
The high fertility rates of many countries are partly the result of low incomes.
Thus, the Catholic Reformation, with its Jansenist derivative, is as demanding as the Protestant Reformation concerning sexual affairs.
John Calvin also makes commercial success a sign of divine election.
Boosting population growth ensures military strength and sufficient fiscal resources.
The problems of economic policy and population are considered by each nation from a purely national angle.
France hesitates to tackle the question of counting, delicate since the disgrace of Vauban.
This measure announces the secularization of the civil status, which becomes the affair of the State and not of the Church.
It is however difficult to apply: it is not calculated the number of inhabitants but that of births and deaths.
These results make Sweden the first country in the world to disclose detailed population statistics.
In almost all of them, the French Enlightenment philosophers are acquainted with populationism or at least do not envisage a situation of overpopulation.
Yet the publications of the results of quantitative surveys prove that there is, on the contrary, an increase in the population.
These statistics are however suspected to be a maneuver intended to increase the tax burden.
The illusion of a depopulation of France is maintained by the authors of the Enlightenment.
"Wrote the father of Pr√©mare in 1700) and leads to reprehensible acts including infanticide, the exposure of newborns.
At the time of M. de Vauban, we were 18 millions; how much are we now?
In 1750, however, he estimates that the population has increased: "We want the land to be depopulated.
Their influence on French intellectuals is such that they exclude the possibility of overcrowding.
If the book presents two articles "Depopulation" and "Population", it presents none on overcrowding.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau is one of the few authors, with strong Enlightenment, to express reservations about population growth.
In the notebooks of 1789, no mention of overcrowding is made by the privileged orders.
Thus, in rural Normandy, girls married at age 26 around 1750 (against age 21 in 1550).
In his account of his "Voyages en France", published in 1792, he describes an overpopulated state.
(...) Attracting foreigners is not desirable either in a country like France.
His analysis, however, is not without political ulterior motive since it criticizes absolutism, for reasons however different from the French philosophers.
Despite this fact, the revolutionary governments will lead a populationist policy, especially to swell the ranks of the army.
Between 1751 and 1801, the English population increased from 5.7 to 8.7 million inhabitants, thanks to the decline in mortality.
This increase is not without consequences on the social assistance system, overwhelmed by the influx of unemployed men.
Despite this fact, the English pastors, who monopolize the demographic debate, refuse to evoke a situation of overpopulation.
Only Thomas Malthus will make the explicit mention, deeply criticizing this system of social assistance.
The demographic question, explicitly addressed by pastors, is implied by non-religious authors.
The population invariably grows wherever livelihoods grow unless strong and overt obstacles stop it.
He thus opens the way to neo-Malthusianism, which advocates the use of contraceptives.
It calls into question their efficiency and the imputations of driving up food prices, including meat.
I want to talk about the so-called right to be fed when his work can not afford him the means.
This misguided multitude is a formidable enemy of liberty, which foments tyranny or causes it to be born.
Its authority in the demographic debate, although contested, remains recognized at national level, then European.
He devotes himself therefore to the reissues of his "Essai" (1805, 1806, 1807, 1817, 1826).
This recognition is not unanimous, it is accused of adopting a selfish or even inhuman point of view on the demographic question.
(...) [My goal] is to improve the lot and increase the happiness of the lower classes of society.
At the end of 2013, 1.4 billion smartphones are in circulation in the world.
They are equipped with more powerful processors and operating systems and more network interfaces.
They replace various objects that we had in our pocket and allow their user to interact with the surrounding equipment.
Optimizing the energy consumption of millions of applications for smartphones is therefore of critical importance.
Then WLAN interfaces like Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 interfaces became ubiquitous.
The energy consumption of a smartphone is defined by the energy cost necessary for the hardware components to carry out their activity.
This activity is driven by software executions related to user activity.
The external environment can also influence the workload of software and hardware operations.
For example, network interference may result in retransmission of data during wireless transmission.
This results in a variation of the workload on the input-output accesses.
It is essential to understand the difference between these two terms which are sometimes used interchangeably.
The energy consumption of homes or offices is measured in kilowatt-hours (1 kWh = 3600 kJ).
In addition, a component of a smartphone may have one or more levels of power states:
Modern smartphones are equipped with a wide variety of integrated hardware components.
Therefore, as a percentage, the memory contributes on average to 6% of the total power.
In sleep mode, however, the memory can go up to 20% because it must maintain the system state.
Its consumption peaks at 30 mW during a video recording, or 1.5% of the total power.
RAM and flash are among the lowest power consumption.
One factor leading to the widespread adoption of mobile phones has been the dramatic improvement in display technologies.
The screen is the primary output device for interaction with the end user.
In other words, the screen consumption represents about 35.5% of the active power of the smartphone.
Very recently, AMOLED displays have begun to replace the standard LCDs of mainstream smartphones.
A study of the consumption of the "BlueCore3" Bluetooth card was carried out in 2006.
Meanwhile, Bluetooth technology has been rapidly improved and consumes less power while improving its transfer rate.
In the standby state, with all network interfaces turned off, and the screen too, the Nokia N95 smartphone consumes 12 mW.
This value represents the minimum consumption of the Nokia N95 smartphone, it is included in all other results.
In addition, the consumption may be different between different types of wireless interfaces.
The Wi-Fi interface can be in five states: transmission, reception, idle, sleep and energy saving.
The consumption is significantly reduced in "energy saving" mode.
The inactive state can be relatively high because it just corresponds to the state preceding the sleep state.
Two factors determine the power consumption due to network activity in a smartphone.
First, the emission energy that is proportional to the length of a transmission and the transmission power level.
Power consumption, with the same idle timeout value, is lower for WCDMA technology than for cDMA2000 technology.
The phenomenon of "tail" state is also very impacting on 3G.
The signal quality of the mobile network is also a source of energy consumption.
The smartphone returns to the "RRC-standby" state when the idle timeout of the smartphone has elapsed.
Unlike 3G, energy in the "tail" state is only 30% of the transfer energy.
Rather, data size dominates energy consumption than inter-transfer times.
The GSM interface has a relatively uniform power consumption, despite a bit rate that is variable.
It also appears that the Edge network consumes more energy in transmission than in reception.
This difference increases considerably when the bandwidth increases (measurements made from a smartphone "ZTE V880").
GPS is the most energy-efficient location system.
The result illustrates the diversity of their symptoms and the causes of the energy bugs.
Here is the result of its ranking for hardware energy bugs:
Many popular sites provide a mobile version, optimized for small screen.
In addition, dynamic web content such as JavaScript and Flash are widely used in many sites.
Although desktop computers can easily handle these dynamic web content, their execution is time consuming and energy consuming.
In addition, the power consumption of mobile browsers varies while loading the same pages and images.
On the connectivity side, Wi-Fi is about four times more efficient than 3G.
This corresponds to a reduction of 20% of the total energy.
This difference can only be explained by the energy cost of the 3G radio interface.
This high value is partly due to the backlight of the smartphone.
However, turning off the backlight, as Android suggests, saves up to 40% power.
When writing an SMS, the power consumed is dominated by the display.
The power consumption when sending an SMS increases linearly with the length of the message.
To download files, the GSM network consumes 40 to 70% less energy than the 3G network.
Indeed, the power of the 3G radio interface is higher than that of GSM.
Unfortunately Wi-Fi networks are far from being as widespread, and therefore accessible as the GSM / EDGE network.
Most streaming services rely on HTTP over TCP.
Games that rely on 3D graphics, are among the most popular applications on smartphones.
The CPU's contribution to total energy consumption can be up to 40%.
Indeed, most of the energy of an application is passed in the access to the input-output components.
These applications, which require real-time localizations, consume a lot of energy.
It takes time, patience, lots of energy and luck.
This energy is partly consumed by useless refreshments of the localization.
Another case is the simultaneous execution of several location-based applications.
These invoke location refreshments independently instead of synchronizing.
Applications may decide to increase these intervals to reduce power consumption, for example when the battery is low.
It is up to the application developers to maintain or not keep the system awake.
Applications can then carry out periodic information activities such as notifications.
These two methods are complementary and must be sufficiently calibrated so as not to affect the validity of the results.
The purpose of power measurement is to establish an accurate measure of the power consumed.
There are two main methods for measuring power at the system level.
Or, a more accurate method, taking measurements of physical power at the component level.
The choice of the method depends on the availability of instruments and the requirements of the power measurement.
Power modeling describes how energy is consumed using mathematical models.
There are two sets of methods for modeling:
In addition, according to Mr Kim, the battery consumption is higher than the power consumption of the smartphone alone.
High energy consumption is already changing our climate in a dangerous way.
By increasing the thickness of smartphones, it becomes possible to make batteries thicker and therefore heavier.
Application designers are encouraged to develop software for smartphones that takes into account energy efficiency.
Their main obstacle is the difficulty of determining the impact of software design decisions on the system's energy consumption.
The main difficulty of renewable energies is that of storage, on two levels.
However, not all applications reduce the energy efficiency of a smartphone.
Automatic brightness adjustment must be included in smartphones.
At the end of 2013, more than 1 billion people owned a smartphone.
In 2011, manufacturers sold more smartphones than PCs.
For example, the annual energy consumption of a subscriber is estimated at 2.34 kWh.
The biggest part of energy consumption comes from the charge of the phone.
The charger, when plugged into an electrical outlet, consumes power, phone connected or not.
For example, in March 2012, US users access the Facebook site mainly with their smartphone.
Another fact, smartphones and tablets use much less energy than larger devices (eg PCs).
Founded in 1997, its head office is located in Lausanne in the canton of Vaud.
Its logo represents a whale tail with the initials of the association (SCS) represented above.
It depends on the contributions of its members as well as donations.
The main objective of the Swiss Cetacean Society is to promote knowledge of marine mammals in order to promote their protection.
To achieve this goal, it mainly uses five instruments:
The instruments necessary to achieve these objectives have been developed and food security has been guaranteed.
CBS organizes offshore data acquisition campaigns on cetacean populations.
The collected data are then transmitted to the scientific representatives who process and exploit them.
This activity mobilizes during the summer research platforms and crews composed of ecovolunteers supervised by specialized naturalists.
Three marine science expedition programs involving eco-volunteering are renewed each year.
Among them, a thousand large whales and tens of thousands of dolphins.
The data thus collected were made available to CIESM.
Sea turtles are among the most endangered animal species in the world according to IUCN.
The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is in critical danger of extinction.
The educational component occupies a prominent place in the local activities of the Swiss Cetacean Society.
For example, CBS trains naturalist guides and organizes conferences and other educational courses.
Today in Switzerland, CAS is a specialized information center serving the public, students, travelers and the media.
Every first Wednesday evening of even months, the SCS organizes forums at EPFL.
Each forum is thus the subject of a particular theme defined in advance.
The SCS is organizing an introductory 2-day introductory course on cetology with its scientific partners in the ocean.
The goal of this workshop is to educate a young public about marine ecology.
He was also part of the Swiss progressive rock band, TEA, and participated in several musical projects.
In 1970, he left for England and London where he joined many friends he had known in Malta.
The group toured Switzerland and Germany intensely, forging a solid reputation and attracting the attention of German producer Dieter Dierks.
A small Swiss hard rock band called Krokus will open regularly for TEA during his concerts in Switzerland.
TEA will separate in 1977 when its record company Vertigo will not renew its contract.
Marc Storace decided to take a break and return to England where he founded a band called "Eazy Money".
Marc had just gotten married, had a job in England and did not want to leave everything on a whim.
Generally, no one leaves his country on a whim or to go in search of adventures.
But he soon gave in and he joined Krokus to record the album Metal Rendez-vous (1980).
The albums selling less well, the incessant tours and the abuses of prohibited substances were right of the group.
It was not until 1995 to see the return of Marc with Krokus.
At the end of 1994, he renewed contacts with Fernando Von Arb and convinced him to reform the group.
In particular, he will play Krokus' hit "Bedside Radio" which will be rehearsed by the crowd.
This moment of great excitement will return Marc's desire to return to the stage with Krokus.
He will meet his friend Fernando Von Arb, and the two will plunge into the writing of a new album.
The recording sessions will be interspersed with participations in various festivals on Swiss soil in front of enthusiastic crowds.
Nevertheless, he assumes his role of leader and signs the title "Hellraiser" which will appear in the soundtrack of the film "Handyman".
It will be released in 1991 under the title "Blue" on the ephemeral German label Eurostar.
In 1998, it will be reissued by BMG Entertainment under the name "Vergeat / Storace" and the title "When a Man ...".
Marc declined the invitation, preferring to stay with Krokus, who was growing in popularity.
In 1993, Marc joined the Swiss hard rock band China for their tour.
In 1993, Marc joined the Swiss musician from Lucerne, Manfred Ehlert, for his project "Manfred Ehlert's Amen".
He shares the song with Glenn Hughes on the eponymous album that will be released in 1994.
On this last album he sings on all tracks except "Make My Day", sung by Glenn Hughes.
In 2000, he participated in the tribute album for the twentieth anniversary of the death of Bon Scott, DC World.
While he was only to interpret the title "Ride On", he finally found himself singing on all the potpourris of the album.
2001, change of style, Marc participates in the project "rock meets classical music" with the opera singer Raphael Haslinger.
The result will be the single "One World" and multiple TV shows and some performances in public.
The album will be released in February 2004 and Marc also participated in writing the lyrics on this album.
It will be released in May 2005 under the name Face Off.
The performance in public will be for the show "Benissimo" May 7, 2005 and attracted the attention of Brian May.
2008, he participates in the concert given on February 15 by the Swiss band "Callaway".
The latter is led by former TEA drummer Roli Eggli, who is also Marc's personal manager.
An album of this concert will be released the same year under the title "Live at Key North".
Thirty-one years after the release of TEA's latest album, a compilation was released on November 13, 2009.
Marc sang, in homage to Steve Lee, the greatest success of Gotthard, "Heaven".
Marc Storace lives in Oberwil in the canton of Basel-Country with his wife Cornelia and his two children Luca and Giuliana.
The Liberal party led by Frederick Peters formed the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the 1890 election.
The Congress Party leads the government, but lacks the majority in both Houses of Parliament.
Tchamassi is a traditional music and dance of Cameroon.
The dancers move slowly, swaying and sometimes with the torso leaning forward.
The music is played by traditional guitars and percussion by men and danced by men and women.
Indian art, music and traditional dances produce the same effect.
The dance and the rhythm Tchamassi, practiced especially in the West of Cameroun, at Bamil√©k√© are accompanied by sanzas mambala.
Very present in the Bamil√©k√© diaspora of the big cities of Cameroon, it is used for the occasions of festive entertainments.
In Bamougoum and Bandjoun, Tchamassi, is the so-called youth music.
Crypto-currencies use a proof-of-work system to protect them from electronic counterfeiting.
This is done in order to mimic the rarity (and value) of precious metals and avoid hyperinflation.
However, these transactions are tamper-proof and inviolable thanks to the use of cryptography.
In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", an anonymous electronic cash system.
Several other crypto-currencies have been created, all of which have not been successful, especially those with little innovation.
During the first years of existence, crypto-currencies gained little by little the attention of the media and the public.
Since 2011, interest has increased rapidly, especially during the rapid rise of Bitcoin prices in April 2013.
An entrepreneur, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin automatic dispenser in the United States on February 20, 2014.
By their intrinsic construction, crypto-currencies escape any regulation.
Nevertheless their supervision is discussed by the monetary authorities on two axes:
In general, the legal status of crypto-currencies varies considerably from one country to another.
But what is unacceptable varies considerably from country to country.
A group of researchers from Oxford and Warwick have shown that bitcoin has characteristics similar to precious metals.
The broker Plus500 is a broker CFD offering a market on Bitcoin and Litecoin.
MtGox (the site is currently closed and the company declared bankruptcy in Japan
Cryptsy is currently closed, following a theft of a significant number of bitcoins.
When a transaction is issued, it is transmitted and validated by the computers that make up the network.
In fact GPUs (graphics card processors) are powerful enough to perform calculations quickly.
The difficulty of generating blocks also lies in the calculation of the energy expended, for the generation of crypto-currencies.
Indeed, since these secondary currencies are less widespread, block gene- ration is more accessible and less competitive.
The Swedish monarchy is the political system in force in Sweden since time immemorial.
Those who value free political systems and free economic systems share similar hopes.
Our political systems and global politics are vastly under-equipped to face the real challenges of today's world.
Over time, Western political systems will evolve to meet the needs of their economies.
At the beginning, it was based on an elective monarchy, who favored one of the dominant dynasties.
The king was traditionally elected in a dynasty of Mora stone.
This law was later replaced by the instruments of government of 1772.
King Gustav IV Adolphus and his descendants were deposed by coup d'etat led by the officers of the Swedish army.
The childless uncle of the former king was elected king and became Charles XIII.
With the "de facto" arrival of parliamentarism in 1917, the powers of the king were, in practice, considerably reduced.
The responsibility for appointing and dismissing the Prime Minister was transferred to the President of the "Riksdag".
The Prime Minister appoints and dismisses the ministers in his sole discretion.
The act of succession of 1810 refers to the descendants of Charles XIV John (Bernadotte house) as heirs to the throne of Sweden.
A constitutional reform of 1980 changed the rules of succession from agnatic primogeniture to an equitable primogeniture.
Thus, the Crown can be passed on to the eldest child, regardless of gender.
This revision retroactively made Victoria of Sweden the heiress of the throne, in front of her youngest brother Carl Philip of Sweden.
In his current reading, only the descendants of Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden can claim the throne.
Before 1918, the King of Sweden wore several titles because of the Swedish Empire.
These instruments were also written in an analytical and contemporary Swedish, better defined by the Swedish Academy established 21 years earlier.
In the old Swedish spelling, the title was then "Sweriges, Norriges, G√∂thes och Wendes Konung".
The wife of a Crown Prince will also bear the title of Crown Princess, the opposite is not true.
Since 1980, they are conferred to all heirs men and women.
He is the son of Francis Delaisi, with whom he became confused at the time of the Munich agreements.
He participated in the Rif War in 1923, to the fury of his father, antimilitarist.
Doctor in law, lawyer at the Court of Appeal of Paris, he is cross of war 1939-1945, knight of the legion of honor.
The Court held that the law of war must be a consensus of all legal systems.
He was a prisoner of war at the Oflag XC from 1940 to 1945.
His son Jacques Delaisi and his daughter Genevi√®ve Delaisi from Parseval each had three children.
He is the author of several books on the CCP, and the principle of the LLC.
His daughter Genevi√®ve Delaisi of Parseval evokes his father in his book "The family romance of Isadora D.

The equality of rights of all citizens is a fundamental principle of the liberal order.
Freedom of expression and the press is guaranteed by the constitution and Turkish laws.
It established a parliamentary regime with a unicameral parliament, the National People's Congress.
The constitution recognized the independence of the judiciary (Supreme Court, Supreme Judicial Council) and private property.

The Abduction of Europe is a painting made in 1643 by Jacob Jordaens (1593-1678).
She is about to climb on the back of the white bull that is lying down gently.
The subject is a pretext for evoking the nature and eroticism of female bodies in harmony with nature.
From now on, we all have a female body or, more exactly, a feminized body.
None of the companions of Europe pay attention to the scene and they continue their games and their occupations.
Jordaens was inspired by the bucolic reading of Ovid in his "Metamorphoses" (II, 835-837).

The "Max Planck Institute of International Social Law" was created in 1980.
Its founder and director until 1990 is Hans F. Zacher, who will become director of the Society.
Bernd Baron von Maydell succeeded him until September 2002, followed by Ulrich Becker.
In July 2001, the institute opened a second department, the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA), headed by Axel B√∂rsch-Supan.
Since then, the institute has been operating under the name "Max Planck Institute of Social Law and Social Policy".
By building empirical models and forecasting, the MEA produces political and economic recommendations.
Max Planck Fellow, directed by Elisabeth Wacker, studies the changes in social systems, especially on disability.
They are related respectively to the two cross-cutting themes "demographic change" and "diversity management".
According to the conveyor, the road cutters who spoke in an Arabic tinged with tamacheq had claimed the MUJAO.
A woman about 70 years old and a girl of about ten years are also injured.
According to the inhabitants, after this massacre of the Imghads make a punitive expedition and execute in retaliation a notable of Djebok.
Fulani farmers say that hundreds of livestock heads have been stolen by Tuaregs.
For Reuters, this violence would not be directly related to the Mali war.
No connection between armed Fulani and jihadists is reported according to them.
As for the tribe of Imghad, it is said to be rather loyal to the Malian government.
The Peuls then attack the Tuaregs who are trying to resist, 25 are killed and 7 wounded, one of them fatally.
According to RFI, almost all the victims are Tuareg Imghads and among the dead are a woman and a child.
The Peuls burn one of the vehicles, the other is taken and carried away.
Soldiers of the Malian army also gain the places and arrest some suspects.
There are also seven wounded, including four evacuees in Gao and three in Ansongo.
However, one of the wounded in Gao Hospital succumbs to his injuries.
According to a person close to the Ministry of Defense, four suspects have been arrested by the Malian authorities.
Human Rights Watch researcher Corinne Dufka says local sources contradict Minister Samaka's comments.
Some organizations, like Human Rights Watch, have solved the problem by refusing any government funding.
According to the H-Azawad newspaper, which favors Tuareg rebels, at least 35 civilians were killed.
He also accuses the Peul militiamen and the Malian army of being linked.

The treasury of social security is responsible for the administration of retirement pensions and public Venezuela.
To take advantage of this advantage, the agency or entity must be solvent with employer contributions and worker contributions.
The DGOS circular of 29 July 2011 assigns a number of missions to the GIRCIs:
Institutions in the inter-region have defined specific missions for the GIRCI SOOM:
All these missions have been the subject of a constitutive agreement signed by all member institutions of the GIRCI.
The GIRCI Sud-Ouest Outre-Mer brings together six university hospitals and two regional centers for the fight against cancer:
It is in charge of strategic management, and relies on the orientations formulated by the members of the Bureau.
It decides in particular on the distribution of the resources allocated to the GIRCI.
He appoints the medical coordinator and the managing coordinator of the GIRCI, as well as the medical delegate.
The Strategic Committee includes, for each of the six university hospitals of the GIRCI and for the two CRLCCs:
The presidency is rotating every two years between the General Managers of metropolitan France.
The rotating presidency will be replaced by an elected presidency of the Council.
Two vice-presidents are also appointed: a Director General of Overseas and a Director General of Metropolitan France.
The Office of the GIRCI is responsible for assisting the Scientific Council and ensuring a general leadership role for the GIRCI.
It develops the action program submitted each year to the Strategic Committee.
The PHRCI is the declination of the PHRC (Hospital Program of Clinical Research) at interregional level.
For the first time, cancer projects are eligible for the PHRCI.
Projects involving collaboration between several hospital centers (CHU and CH) in the Inter-region are encouraged.
This APIDOM was endowed for 2013 with an envelope of 300 000 ‚Ç¨.
The maximum budget per project is set at ‚Ç¨ 50,000, including DOMiens surcoutures.
An evaluation will be made at the end of the allocation for the assessment of the year and assessment of the candidate's future prospects.
Gaston Perrot is the son of Ernest Perrot, miller and Marguerite Jacob.
He marries Fernande Larcher with whom they had three sons, Pierre, Roger and Jean.
This industrial activity places it in contact with farmers in the region.
Nothing seems to devote Gaston Perrot to politics, it is above all a brilliant industrialist.
Internal documents at the RPF present him as an industrialist "unanimously respected", including by the communists.
He is a candidate for deputation and receives the support of UNR for the legislative elections of November 1958.
1958: He is elected deputy of Yonne by 60% of the voters.
- Grant special powers to the Government to restore order in Algeria after the week of barricades.
The "Great Meaning" was born on July 16, 1962.
The communist Jean Cordillot asserts himself as his main opponent in the legislative elections.
In November 1962, the Mayor of Sens lost 1223 votes to win in the first round.
A week later, 28170 votes are cast on his name, an almost identical result four years ago.
He leaves the status of relative to join the group of UNR-UDT under the second legislature.
Discreet at the Palais-Bourbon, He did not speak in the hemicycle between 1962 and 1967.
1965: reelected to municipal, he intends to succeed himself in the legislative elections of 1967.
1967: He is reelected with 53% against his eternal adversary, the communist Jean Cordillot.
Candidate for a fourth consecutive term, he obtains on average 46% of the votes cast.
His only opponent in the second round is Jean Cordillot again.
And the new second round, unlike the first, gave Viktor Yushchenko the winner.
The elected Icaunais remains faithful to his discretionary practices at the Palais-Bourbon under the fourth legislature.
In 1971, at age 73, he did not run in the municipal elections in his very dear town of Sens.
In 1980, Gaston Perrot died in Sens at the age of 81.
In 2015, this magnificent mill St Louis lost all its industrial machines, its trucks.
This building was the pride of the Perrot family and Gaston Perrot.
Yet it is very difficult to obtain information on the history of this industrial mill.
Before 1970, three important mills were in high activity inside the city of Sens.
Of these three mills, only Dum√©e mills have resisted the evolution of the global milling market.
Their wheat crush production increased from 20 tons per day in 1890 to 450 tons per day in 2015.

The Economic Journal or EJ is a scientific journal on economics published under the name "Royal Economic Society" by Wiley-Blackwell.
First published in 1891, the EJ is one of the founding journals of the economy and has a good world reputation in its field.
First, the global economy seems more chaotic than it appeared ten years ago.
The EJ publishes documents in all areas of the economy and has eight issues a year.
One of the central objectives of the new society was to create a forum where British economic research could be published.
His words drew about 200 people to the opening session of the Association.
Between the years 1886 and 1890 there had been much dialogue between British economists.
Palgrave, Foxwell and Marshall have explored the possibility of establishing such a publication as part of the Royal Statistical Society.
After discussions with the company, however, it was concluded that a new organization should be inaugurated to pursue these goals.
This decision was supported by economist and philosopher John Neville Keynes (1852-1949).
The first issues of the journal indicate the publishers' meticulous efforts to adhere to this promise.
Among the articles published in the early issues of the journal, they were documents expressing socialist, individualist and Ruskin views.
The document was published in a minor magazine and is not very well cited.
"The Economic Journal" was published by some influential British economists.
Despite his diplomas, Edgeworth admitted the difficulty of establishing the new journal.
Edgeworth resumed his role as an editorialist between 1918 and 1925 alongside John Maynard Keynes.
In commemoration for his dedication to the service of the economic magazine, an award is now being offered in his honor.
Dutch literature from the second half of the 20th century
In the second half of the twentieth century, Thai elections alternated with military coups.
Of course, the second half of the 20th century is far from perfect.
If many people prefer to forget the war as quickly as possible, in the literature, we remember it.
In the literature of the 1940s and 1950s, the Second World War played a leading role.
The Global Fund also plays a vital role in strengthening health systems in developing countries.
Their books are often only partly fictional, or even based on real facts.
The experiences of the war seem to determine the writing of many young writers who became adults during the war.
That's what Willem Frederik Hermans said in an interview:
For writers, as well as for readers, literature can serve as a remedy for trauma.
But literature is also one of the ways in which we understand, preserve and shape our past.
Since 1945, novels and stories have contributed, to a large extent, to the image of war.
From a few years after the Second World War, these verses of Lucebert date:
"Writing a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric," Adorno wrote in 1949.
In his poetry, Lucebert systematically deconstructs all the conventions previously considered as the essential characteristics of the genre.
He resolutely rejects all the old forms, stanzas and rhyme.
The Netherlands has long been enriched to the detriment of the Dutch East Indies.
The memories of a youth spent in India are a common theme in this literature.
A growing child who perceived the Indies above all as a paradise, should he have been aware of all this?
While the German occupation is discussed at length, silence is kept on the Japanese prison camps.
In this book, the author transposes his experience as a young boy in Japanese captivity.
Many who have experienced similar experiences claim to be recognized in the novel.
However, the image of the 1950s considered "boring" has often been nuanced.
Nevertheless, the clich√© helps us understand what happened in the post-war literature.
In many ways, their works from the 1940s and 1950s are frankly disconcerting.
Some aspects that reappear in many of these novels determine the disconcerting character of these characters.
First, the absence of ideals or great feelings: there is no more faith and even more love.
This music is also a favorite theme of the poetry of the "cinquantards".
As a group, the movement disintegrates fairly quickly as soon as this recognition is a fact.
In 1961, Snoek left the editorial staff of the avant-garde journal, followed shortly after by two other Flemings, Gust Gils and Pernath.
Innovation is also perceptible in the prose of other Flemish authors of that time.
Literature, and poetry in particular, has a reputation for being complicated.
Should we really read the lyrics to be able to seize everything?
In a work of art, a concept takes on the appearance of an image, whereas a text or a poem implies the intervention of language.
As multiple talents, some authors create works of art themselves.
Lucebert is one of them, like Hugo Claus and Charlotte Mutsaers.
However, through digitization and the Internet, this distinction is reversed.
The material of words counts more than the message it contains; the form takes over the content.
Language is above all considered as the raw material for creating an autonomous object.
In 1970-1971, an exhibition of concrete poetry took place at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.
Should literature describe everyday life in a realistic and anecdotal way?
Or is it, in literature, primarily language as well as its possibilities and powerlessness?
This question is above all the issue of all kinds of polemics about poetry.
Poetry on stage begins as an activity outside the performing arts.
Ingmar Heytze, a poet who emerged from the shadows in the 1990s, practices this art.
This poetry responds directly to the music or actions of the body.
Lucebert's approach follows the same spirit: he reworks his poems at the very moment of the recitation.
Simon Carmiggelt, too, describes "the ordinary man" with a slight dose of irony.
Instead of being a stable reality, the world is made up of the stories we tell about it.
This conception of things permeates postmodernist works such as Atte Jongstra, Willem Brakman and the Flemish Peter Verhelst.
Another important characteristic is that of intertextuality: all narration takes its sources in existing narratives.
Where it distinguishes two variants of postmodernism literary: this is intellectualist, the other play.
The latter is dominated by the struggle of writers and poets against modernist arrogance.
Postmodern literary texts (of the intellectualist type) bear witness to the extreme awareness that man lives in a language world.
According to Van Bastelaere, literary journals serve as war machines.
What he blames Tom Lanoye goes in the same direction.
According to Van Bastelaere, Lanoye does not follow the right path: he delivers his poetry to the holders of power.
He gives instructions on the decor, lighting, music and costumes of the characters in the room.
Claus is therefore a true playwright, who deals with more than just text, which he often puts himself on the stage.
The condemnation is the reaction that Claus had envisaged by touching on sexual and religious taboos.
The following year, he says in an interview, he did not want to produce a literature explicitly committed.
Theater companies such as those of Tg STAN and Jan Fabre perform around the world.
Directors like Luk Perceval and Ivo van Hove are flourishing in Flanders and abroad.
Like their predecessor Claus, the playwrights of the new generation rewrite the classics while referring to current issues.
", 1997), Tom Lanoye's adaptation of Shakespeare's Two-Roses war cycle pieces.
By its emancipatory character, feminist literature belongs to committed literature.
Specialist publishing houses are founded in women's literature, such as An Dekker (Amsterdam) and Sara (Nijmegen).
Universities create departments, chairs or centers for women's studies.
The 1970s are the second wave of feminism, which began in the late 1960s.
Through naturalism, explicit sexuality enters the field of literature.
From then on, Dutch litigators loose the bridle with regard to pornography.
Through her work, Cremer paves the way for a more liberal approach to sexuality in the literary novel.
"(from 1955) by Anna (Annie) Maria Geertruida Schmidt represents an innovation.
His playful and mischievous poetry for children leads to a liberation.
Thus, at home, kings behave like ordinary people.
In the 1970s, parents and non-conformist educators worked to make the emancipation of children's literature progress.
In this respect we can cite Lia Timmermans' series of children's books.
"Problem books" have been promoted so clearly that stagnation becomes inevitable.
With nostalgia, and sometimes reluctantly, these writers describe their past and the world of their parents during the post-war reconstruction.
Life and biography are sometimes in a reverse relationship.
So there is a group of writers who take their lives as subject of their books in a more direct way than the previous ones.
Connie Palmen is undoubtedly the most famous of these authors.
However, they do not consider it necessary that each fact recounted in their books is reducible to reality.
To this group belong the Dutch Arnon Gr√ºnberg and the Flemish Dimitri Verhulst.
According to her, the need for self-knowledge is a prerequisite for fiction writing.
In the novels of this period, the outside world plays a role again.
At the same time, it is the question of what it means to write a novel about these issues.
The question is whether she will be able to act in time.
Bouazza writes in a baroque style of which the Dutch have forgotten the existence for a long time.
But by dint of appearing in the media for the purpose of promoting their books, the authors become public figures.
Another symptom of the rapprochement between mass culture and literature is the rise of literary festivals.
Giphart's literary beginning is read as a description of the youth culture of the time.
On the side of some magazines, drawn only a few hundred copies, we see born many important literary innovations.
She was born in 1906 by the producer of Roberto Incerti et l'industriel Giovanni Agnelli.
Its head office is located in Villar Perosa, in the province of Turin in Piedmont, Italy.
Since February 2011, the company is part of the German group Neumayer Tekfor.
The company was born in the lap of the Italian car manufacturer Fiat.
Roberto Incerti created in 1906 in Turin a company of manufacture of axes of bicycles and ball bearings.
Shortly after he joined the Senator Giovanni Agnelli, the founder of the Fiat group.
From their association was born a company producing ball bearings for the automotive industry.
The site is located "Via Marocchettin", near the Fiat Corso Dante factory.
At the beginning, the company does not manufacture all the necessary elements for the bearings, the balls are imported from abroad.
The Turin plant quickly becomes insufficient to meet Fiat's demand.
In 1909, Roberto Incerti sold all of them to Giovanni Agnelli.
The company then becomes totally independent and is renamed Officine di Villar Perosa Agnelli & C ..
The company starts the complete production of all components necessary for the integrated production of bearings.
The production exceeds 200,000 units in 1910 and has 340 employees.
Also the factory adapts and structures to produce projectiles and firearms like FIAT Mod.1915 Villar Perosa.
The company has three hydroelectric dams and has diversified its production.
The new plant will be inaugurated in 1924 and includes employee housing and a nursery for their children.
Thus will be inaugurated Chamb√©ry units in France, to meet the demand of French manufacturers in connection with Fiat.
Many subsidiaries are created RIV Belgium, RIV Argentina and Deutsche RIV.
It is named Lazarus Kaganovich in honor of his political action and his friendship with Stalin.
In 1938, RIV inaugurated a new factory in Massa Tuscan town, on the Mediterranean coast near Carrara.
RIV will also manufacture bearings for the Junkers Ju 87 German bombers also called "Stuka".
All RIV factories like Fiat's will be bombed repeatedly by the American Air Force until they are completely destroyed.
The Turin factory will be rendered unusable from December 1943.
At the end of the war, RIV became involved in the immediate reconstruction of its production tool.
This plant will be the first in the Mezzogiorno and will be fully operational in 1959.
In the period of economic expansion of the Italian economic miracle, the company opened three new factories.
But periods of global economic expansion have almost always been characterized by symbiotic imbalances.
The only significant period of "balanced" economic expansion was at the beginning of the 19th century.
In 1956, Cassino, in 1959 Pinerolo near Villar Perosa et in 1965, Airasca.
The company changes its name to become RIV-SKF Officine di Villar Perosa S.p.A ..
Most factories are enlarged to cope with the ever-increasing demand.
In 1974, the company "RFT SpA" is created and groups the productions of all technical articles of very high precision.
In 1980, RIV-SKF became a holding company which included RIV-SKF Industreis SpA, RFT-RIV FIRGAT SpA and CIMEC SpA.
In 1988, the two entities RIV-SLF and SKF fusionnet to give birth to the group SKF Industries SpA.
In 2011, the "Societ√† Meccaniche Villar perosa SpA" - OMVP the original company RIV, is sold to the German group Neumayer Tekfor.
With more than 100 men according to the local police chief, the attackers destroy the forward station.
The attack is claimed the same day by the Taliban in a statement to the media.
The Afghan military forces suffered the heaviest casualties in the fighting for months.
For Shujah-Ul Mulk Jalala, governor of the province, seven soldiers were captured during the fighting.
Talks are a time commitment to carry out an exchange of prisoners, but negotiations are suspended by the Taliban.
Meanwhile, the negotiations on trade liberalization seemed to ignore historical trends.
Emanuele Krakamp started learning music with his father, Francesco (1788-1828).
Concertist in Europe and America, he also performs in Tunisia, Alexandria and Cairo.
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values.
His compositions are published by Ricordi in Milan and by Girard in Paris.
Emanuele Krakamp is the first flutist to adopt the Boehm system developed by Theobald Boehm.
In Benevento, a flute competition bears his name in his honor.
Samir Belamri, born April 20, 1982, is an international French footballer of beach football.
In 2007, Samir Belamri takes part in the Beach Soccer World Cup with the France team.
France reached the semi-finals after two victories over Italy (6-5) and Portugal (5-3) at the Superfinale in Marseille.
After all, who could have predicted a final between France and Italy?
But the Bleus lost in the final against these same Portuguese (7-6).
He competes at the 2009 European Beach Soccer Cup in Rome.
The rue du Mar√©chal-Joffre is an artery in the center of Pau in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.
It connects the district of Pau Castle to Place Clemenceau.
The city of Pau developed in the Middle Ages from its emblematic castle.
Initially, the built space was mainly grouped around the latter, forming the present district of the castle.
But the city's need for extension was quickly felt by population growth.
But with population growth, energy needs are increasing and fragile ecosystems are under threat.
Constrained by fortifications that have become too narrow, the creation of the Grande Rue makes it possible to direct urban sprawl towards the east of the castle.
Many mansions are thus made to accommodate the notables of the city.
The French Revolution led to the departure of the convents, the disappearance of the parliament and the creation of the prefecture.
These upheavals will allow the artery to strengthen its commercial vocation.
The revolutionary period is also the occasion of a name change inflation for the street.
In 1889, the New Galleries are built and thus launch the wave of department stores in Pau.
In 1908, the New Galleries were moved to a larger building on Place Clemenceau (now Galeries Lafayette).
During this century, the street briefly changed its name to be called rue Louis-Philippe between 1845 and 1849.
After the First World War, the street definitely takes the name of Marshal Joffre as a tribute to his military exploits.
Significant work is being done in 2011 and 2012 to give this street a pedestrian character.
The SILEX process was developed in Australia by Dr.
Horst Struve, with Silex Systems Limited, founded in 1988.
Also in 2008, Cameco Corporation (the world's largest uranium producer) joined GLE.
Silex Systems completed the second phase of testing in 2005, followed by a loop test program.
In 2007, Silex Systems signed an exclusive licensing and marketing agreement with General Electric.
The loop test program was then transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina.
This first phase of loop testing, conducted at the Wilmington site, was completed in 2011.
In 2010, there was a debate about the proliferation of the SILEX process.
Compared to other enrichment processes, the SILEX process takes up four times less space and consumes much less energy.
which is close to the upper limit of "low enriched" uranium, by definition less than 10%.
This authorization was granted by the NRC on 19 September.
These industrial projects have been idled as a result of declining global demand for uranium.
The ray must then be sent on uranium hexafluoride molecules (the only uranium compound to be gaseous under acceptable conditions).
The details of the process have not been made public, in particular how it differs from previous developments.
At this frequency, only 1% of the incoming flux of UF reacts.
This results in a necessarily large inflow, and a low enrichment rate.
SILEX is a unique case of process constituting information classified by the US federal government.
The US federal government must intervene in the water sector.
Six key objectives in the field of education are defined, including universalizing primary education and massively reducing illiteracy.
Girls were only tolerated in certain cases where they were excluded from pre-adolescence.
In the 1950s, after independence, a special effort will be made on education.
When, in early 1979, the People's Republic of Kampuchea succeeded to the Khmer Rouge regime, the situation seemed desperate.
The mere fact of knowing how to read and write was enough then to become a teacher.
Wearing the uniform, at the expense of the families, is obligatory.
The statistical data specific to the least developed countries deserve to be scrupulously questioned.
Central banks in advanced and emerging countries have poured heavily on liquidity.
The lack of schooling is a phenomenon that affects most girls.
Three indicators allow to approach the level of performance of the primary school:
Therefore caution should be exercised in the statement of data.
A first photograph of the functioning of the College allows to point the following elements:
The official theoretical program includes the following subjects: Khmer language, foreign languages, mathematics, science, social sciences, physical education and health.
Today, the number of non-Baccalaureate teachers is becoming increasingly rare.
In addition, all primary school teachers appear to have received minimal training.
The net enrollment rate represents the relevant evaluation tool used by UNESCO.
"98%" of Cambodian youth have access to primary education in 2012.
The presentation of school enrollments by type of education (Table 6) makes it possible to shed light on the progress of schooling from a different angle.
It is as if the new hires had been allocated primarily to secondary schools.
According to the Cambodian Association of Independent Teachers, almost all Level 1 students would not have books to study.
Thus, the notion of quality of education also questions, indirectly, the internal efficiency of the Cambodian educational system.
The reduction in repetition rates, which is limited in secondary education, appears very clearly in primary education.
The argument used seems more of a budgetary nature (cost of repetition) than strictly educational.
However, does this general drop in repetition result in a more efficient school system?
In other words, is the transition to higher education based on the attainment of the learning required for new learning?
Among these, two indicators appear decisive: the survival rate per year of study and the rate of early school leaving.
Thus, repetition and premature abandonment affect the poorest segments of the population.
A few years later, the situation in this area has not really improved.
This mechanism of fraud seems to creep in, as indicated in the next chapter, dangerously throughout the school system.
This use sometimes leads to extreme behavior that is even more reprehensible.
In this rather positive evolutionary socio-economic context, the landscape of primary and secondary education has changed.
Recent studies, accompanied by sometimes incomplete statistics, do not alter the conclusions cautiously developed then.
The performance of pre-primary education in relation to enrollment figures remains low.
In fourteen years, the number of pupils attending school has multiplied by 2.4, that of the number of teachers by two.
In addition, over four hundred establishments were built in four years.
This operation resulted in a dramatic drop in the success rate.
Of the 60,596 candidates, only 17, 94% passed the exam.
Moreover, within this population, women are a significant majority.
The Ministry of Education plans for the year 2018, rates of 3% and 25% respectively.
At the end of the United States War of Independence, the mainland is dissolved.
The construction of the first six frigates of the US Navy is authorized under this law.
In 1882, the US Navy consisted of a large number of obsolete ships.
The US Navy enters the Second World War after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
The resolution is presented to the Continental Congress on October 3, 1775.
The USS "Hannah" is launched on September 5, 1775, from the port of Beverly (Massachusetts).
On this day, Congress authorizes the purchase of two ships and their armament to attack British merchant ships.
They are mostly surpassed by the Royal Navy, and almost all are captured or sunk before 1781.
The congress is also starting to massively use Corsairs with some success.
For this purpose, 1697 letters of marque are issued by the Congress.
John Paul Jones, hero of the US Navy, was also particularly famous during the Revolution.
In addition to a general lack of money, other factors are behind the disarmament of the navy.
After the American War of Independence, the new United States must struggle to stay afloat financially.
Only the majority of national income came from taxes on imported goods.
The American merchant marine was before the revolution protected by the British navy.
Quickly, the pirates attack the US Navy and capture 11 merchant ships and more than a hundred sailors.
The ship still exists thanks to the efforts of Oliver Wendell Holmes, anchored in Boston Harbor.
At the same time, tensions between the United States and France developed during the Second World War.
By 1797, they had already seized more than 300 American ships.
Newly elected President John Adams takes steps to deal with this crisis.
It will be incumbent, however, on the newly elected president to show strong leadership to avoid this.
He is finally trying to negotiate a similar agreement to the London Treaty with France.
A relatively common practice in Europe but scandalizing the Americans.
The latent war with France is conducted almost exclusively at sea, mainly between corsairs and merchant ships.
The rest of the ships in service are sold and the seamen are sacked with only four months salary.
The Marines invaded the shores of Tripoli in 1805, capturing the city of Derna.
This is the first time in US history that its flag has floated on a foreign conquest.
This military action is enough to urge the leaders of Tripoli to sign a peace treaty.
President Thomas Jefferson and his Republican party are opposed to a navy too big.
In 1807, the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, fueled the tension between the two countries on this subject.
On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on Britain and invaded British Canadian territory.
On both sides of the belligerents, it is expected that much of the war fighting will be at sea.
The crew of the British ship was amazed to see its balls bounce against a particularly resistant oak hull.
After his capture, the ship, too damaged as a result of the fight, is finally set on fire by the Americans.
The latter is integrated into the US Navy as USS "Macedonian".
During the summer of 1814, the British carried out the Chesapeake campaign, culminating in amphibious assaults on Washington and Baltimore.
After the war, the Navy, endowed with more funds, engages in the construction of many ships.
Among the sailors enlisted at that time many men were born abroad.
Sodomy on board is rarely prosecuted.
Two powerful squadrons were formed under the command of Commodore Stephen Decatur and William Bainbridge.
Shortly after, the US squadron also captured the Algerian brig Estedio during the Battle of Cape Palos.
On June 28, the US squadron reached Algiers and forced the Dey to negotiate peace.
The Americans get the liberation of their prisoners and the right to sail and trade in the Mediterranean freely.
It originates mainly from privateers from the newly independent states of Latin America.
In 1819, the Congress authorized President James Madison to take the necessary measures to deal with this threat.
He then decided to embark on a diplomatic strategy supported by the canons of the navy.
An agreement was reached with Venezuela in 1819, which did not prevent ships from being captured.
The Africa Squadron was created in 1820 to address the problem of the slave trade.
The maritime struggle will resume on the African coast only after the adoption of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain in 1842.
In addition, the ships used are too big to act effectively near the African coast.
The school was finally approved by Congress in 1851 and christened the Annapolis Naval Academy.
The US Navy plays a vital role in the operations of the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848.
The fleet allows the capture or destruction of almost all Mexican vessels in the Gulf of California.
A friendship treaty in theory but especially an agreement on the opening of Japan to trade with the United States and Europe.
On March 8, 1862, the Confederate Navy engaged the first combat of a battleship CSS Virginia to break the blockade.
The outcome of the battle is indecisive between these ships of a new kind.
The Confederation is, however, obliged to scuttle the CSS Virginia in May 1862 to avoid its capture.
The USS "Monitor" becomes a prototype for the construction of many warships by the Marine Union.
Following the technological evolution of the battleships, the use of new weapons is developing such as naval mines or torpedoes.
The submarine war also appeared during the American Civil War.
During the Battle of Mobile Bay, mines are used to protect the harbor.
However, the ship is barely damaged and the explosion damages the submarine which will be immobilized for some time.
The blockade is now total thus hastening the end of the war.
After the American Civil War, the Navy entered a period of decline.
The navy will no longer be able to sustain a major conflict until 1897.
After a small skirmish, Rodgers launched an amphibious assault with 650 men on the forts that protect Seoul.
When the Virginius Affair broke out in 1873, a Spanish battleship anchored in the port of New York.
The Navy realizes then that it does not have any ship capable of competing with such a machine of war.
These five ships will take part in the Spanish-American War of 1898.
By the time the Garfield Administration took office in 1881, the state of the Navy had deteriorated further.
Hunt recognizes the need to modernize the navy, and sets up an advisory council to make recommendations.
These modern ships make it possible to train a new generation of men and officers.
Only, an independence movement is emerging in Cuba and initiates the Cuban War of Independence.
But it explodes in the port of Havana resulting in popular support for the war with Spain.
The Asiatic Squadron, under the command of George Dewey, immediately leaves Hong Kong for the Philippines.
Cuba gets its independence, and the United States get their hands on Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam.
The US Navy will also take into account another crucial element, logistical support.
Advantageously for the development of the new navy, his most ardent political supporter, Theodore Roosevelt, became president in 1901.
The Naval Base of Guant√°namo Bay in Cuba was built in 1905 primarily to protect the canal.
And following the arrest of eight American sailors, the United States decided to invade and occupy Veracruz.
The city is under American control at the end of the day and the fighting finally ends on April 24th.
The zone remains occupied by the Americans until November 23, 1914.
President Wilson then ordered the Navy to seize the ship.
A naval brigade of the navy thus seizes the ship for inspection.
Under pressure from President Woodrow Wilson, the Germans decided to suspend the total submarine war in August 1915.
But there is still almost no plan for war that goes beyond the defense of major US ports.
On the fleet itself, only a third of the ships are quite ready.
His most recent biographer concludes that Daniels did not prepare the navy for the war she was going to face.
Thus the rise of the shipyards of the Navy is particularly marked during this period.
Add to these figures 192 killed in the United States Coast Guard and 629 in the merchant marine.
He tries to abolish aviation in 1919 because he can not conceive of his potential for the fleet.
However, Roosevelt vigorously opposes the latter and invalidates Benson's decisions
The conference is concretized by the 1922 Washington Treaty and the limits on the use of submarines.
The treaty prescribes a ratio of 5: 5: 3: 1: 1 for the major ships of the signatory nations of the treaty.
Japan is recognized as the third naval power ahead of France and Italy.
One of the first consequences is to encourage the development of light cruisers and aircraft carriers.
This program also receives support from former Assistant Secretary of the Navy now President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
He refuses any additional funds for the naval bases of Guam and the Philippines.
But American isolationism still blocks any military response.
Preferring the diplomatic path, Washington demands and obtains apologies and compensation from Japan.
During World War I, African Americans were enlisted in the US Navy until 1919.
From the 1930s, a few were recruited to serve as Stewards at the Officers' Mess.
Afro-Americans are recruited in large numbers at Roosevelt's insistence after 1942.
Even before the official entry into the US war, US Navy ships are involved in several fights.
The Navy realized while the isolationist aims of the Congress do not yet allow to finance a more ambitious program.
The young commanders then organized a Submarine Officers Conference in 1926.
American submarines are redesigned to approach the German model.
The Salmon Class was launched in 1937, followed by the Tambor class in 1939 and the Gato class in 1940.
The ships are designed to ensure 65 crew members of relative good living conditions.
After the Pearl Harbor disaster, Roosevelt turns to the most aggressive admiral of the US Navy, Admiral Ernest J. King.
Hated but respected, he makes all these decisions from his command post in Washington.
During the war, US Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox until his death in 1944.
For example, he insisted on taking Guadalcanal, despite strong objections from the US Army.
Its main strike force is built around aircraft carriers based in Pearl Harbor, under the command of Chester Nimitz.
By breaking the Japanese code, the Navy has a major advantage over Japan.
Midway's victory marks a turning point in the Pacific War.
King also pays special attention to the submarines he wants to use to break the Japanese logistics system.
Built for long-term missions in tropical waters, they tackle Japanese freighters, troop transports and tankers.
This attack forces Admiral King to develop a new strategy based on aircraft carriers.
The United States is powerless in the first six months of the Pacific War.
But the Japanese aviation has a certain advantage with the Mitsubishi A6M Zero.
The latter is superior in scope and maneuverability to its US counterpart, the Grumman F4F Wildcat.
The Americans then build the Hellcat that goes into service at the end of 1943.
They are more maneuverable at higher altitudes and better in dive.
They also have armor and superior firepower (6 machine guns fire 120 rounds per second).
The turning point came in 1944 when he launched 8 aircraft carriers but lost 13.
The new American aircraft carriers are much better designed, with more anti-aircraft guns and powerful radar.
It is an extremely intense campaign for the air and land forces as well as for the navy.
On the European front, the Allies are fighting a long battle against German submarines during the Battle of the Atlantic.
In the Pacific, it is American submarines that hunt Japanese convoys.
At the end of the war, the United States had 260 submarines in service.
52 submarines were lost, 36 in shares in the Pacific.
The influence of American submarines in the Pacific War is extremely important.
They make it possible to destroy the Japanese merchant fleet and in January 1945, Japan's oil supply is permanently cut off.
In the summer of 1943, the United States launched the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign.
After this success, the Americans set out to conquer the Mariana Islands and Palau in the summer of 1944.
This is one of the largest aircraft carrier battles in history and a disaster for the Japanese Navy.
While the Americans lost only 123 aircraft, the Japanese lost nearly 400 aircraft and three carriers.
After the victory of the Mariana Islands, the United States begins the reconquest of the Philippines in Leyte in October 1944.
The kamikazes cost the US Navy the biggest losses in its history with 36 ships sunk and 243 damaged.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Navy scrapped or put to sleep a very large number of ships.
In 1948, the US Navy has only 267 active-duty ships.
It becomes important for the Navy, even in peacetime, to have a large fleet.
The Navy is constantly at the forefront of technology.
The navy is leading the development of the first nuclear submarine launcher.
Regarding nuclear weapons, the first atomic bombs for naval aviation are shipped on ships from 1954.
They are quickly followed by a wide range of tactical nuclear weapons ranging from surface-to-air missiles to anti-submarine warheads.
They become one of the pillars of US nuclear deterrence because of their discretion.
That's more than the size of the entire US nuclear arsenal since 2007.
During the Korean War, the North Korean Navy does not have a real navy.
Task Force 77 supports the landing of Pohang on July 18, 1950.
In all 15 aircraft carriers of the US Navy participate in the Korean War but never more than four simultaneously.
The Navy records only very small losses in terms of ships.
The mines and firing of North Korean coastal artillery also damaged 87 other US warships.
Figures to which must be added 4043 sailors died of illness or injury.
Throughout the conflict, the Navy maintains the superiority at sea and in the skies of Korea.
The likelihood of this attack has since been questioned.
It is a large combination of US Navy ship that participates in the Vietnam War.
Overall, the effectiveness of the bombing campaigns is much lower than in the Korean War.
The US Navy is participating jointly in the US Air Force bombing air campaigns against North Vietnam.
It also provides amphibious transport of Marines as well as logistical and medical support.
Although aircraft carriers have never been directly attacked, three have suffered serious incidents, with many casualties.
More than 530 naval planes were lost in action and 320 in accidents.
A total of 1,842,000 sailors serve the duration of the conflict in which 1631 die and 4178 are wounded.
In 1978, the fleet was reduced to 217 surface ships and 119 submarines.

The narrative is structured through the alternation of four main forms:
So to understand the narrative framework, several elements must be taken into account:
Each of these camps is represented in the story by an iconic character.
Beside these antagonisms will be developed other possible ways; they are represented by the promotion "evolution".
Gaia is actually the personified and conscious version of the planet Earth, it is at the center of the story.
The big asteroids that threaten the Earth are all called Theia in memory of the first asteroid that threatened the planet.
Gaia's other goal is to regain contact with her parasites.
As a result of the story, its goals and relationships with its residents will evolve.
The story takes place on a very wide field that goes from earth to space.
However, we can define some places of predilection for the unfolding of the main intrigues:
The main shocks with other asteroids and the probable impact with Theia 13 are mentioned.
The shock with the Earth would produce 90% of extinction of terrestrial species.
David Wells teacher, presents the "evolution" promotion prizes, the trophy of which represents a Tiktaalik.
Aurore and David are married and have 10-year-old triplets: Ishtar, Quetzalcoatl and Osiris.
David, driven from his home by his wife, finds refuge in his office at the Sorbonne.
Then indicates that the winners of the "evolution" promotion have also been invited to the island.
The rocket charged to destroy Theia 13, Lymphocyte 13 is on the takeoff ramp.
The festivities continue, but Emma 666 is worried about the danger represented by the asteroid.
The president refuses, and tells him to fend for himself.
Ovitz therefore urgently decided to heap up all the inhabitants of the island in the Albatross.
The wave arrives, the Micro-Humans are crammed aboard The Albatross "in extremis" while Lymphocyte 13 prepares to take off.
Shipwrecked people find themselves walking in the desert in a scorching heat, the inefficiency of their technology makes them helpless.
Meanwhile, Lymphocyte 13 lands on the asteroid to deposit explosives.
The crew digs to bury the nuclear bomb, it is then that the ground cracks.
Meanwhile, the castaways of L'Albatros walk and end up joining the sea, where they fall face to face with the help.
Commander Andrieux (of the ship Georges Brassens) warns the survivors of the situation on the vessel Lymphocyte 13.
The vote took place at the UN assembly and the majority decided to destroy the asteroid.
Yet the three astronauts are not satisfied, and refuse to obey.
They in turn opt for a vote that will decide the future of the land.
It is by the majority that the destruction of the asteroid is voted.
But Emma 568 and Emma 567 manage to get out of their bonds and attack by surprise Emma 568.
The battle is raging, Emma 567 is killed after a fierce fight and Emma 321 wins.
But the fate of the earth is not decided so far.
The asteroid is too close to the earth and Emma 321 refuses to sacrifice herself even though time is running out.
At the moment the bomb explodes, there is a breakdown.
Repairs take time and put the Earth at risk because the asteroid is near, too close ...
But the asteroid was too close, debris fall all over the world and cause cataclysms.
Consequence of the fall of the asteroid: three billion deaths.
The United Nations Assembly discusses the contingent and tendentious nature of Micro-Humans regarding the mission.
The United Nations sent a mission to help establish local institutions.

The proposal is put to the vote, and admitted with a narrow majority.
Three years have passed since the collision with Theia 13 debris.
For his part, Professor Frydman produces a new generation of sexed robots: Casanova006 and Geisha006.
This technological breakthrough is a valuable advantage for Micro-Humans pioneers in this field.
But these, too confident, will make mistakes that will eventually lead to dramatic events.
Assisted taxi driver Abdelatif, they try to pass, but are stopped by the police.
They are finally released by Colonel Ovitz and Martin Janicot.
However, Emach technology blocks the development of any form of latent conflict that would cause such a conflagration.
This causes the widening of the conflict at the world level with a triple alliance Saudi-India-Russia and Iran-China-Korea.
Each camp thinks it is a privileged client and believes that Micro-Humans will join them.
After some research, the heroes discover the second planetary phone in the volcano Rano Raraku.
Once arrived, theatrical: they fall on the carnage following the bombing of the island.
The second touch Tehran, and the shockwave is perceived until Azerbaijan and destroyed nuclear power plants.
The impact is so important that it produces an artificial night that covers the earth.
Emma 666 wonders about the damage done on Earth because the cloud cover prevents to see what happens.
Final assessment of the bombardment: 4 billion deaths.
For its part, Gaea menacing, claims to be fertilized, that is to say, to be struck by this space object, which she knows fertile.

The show is also broadcast entirely on Plug RTL for Belgian and Luxemburg viewers.
Benjamin Castaldi stopping presenting the program, Christophe Beaugrand is the new animator.
The final is not broadcast on television because of the deadly attacks in √éle-de-France during the evening.
In addition, the producer of the show announced that the sets will change as and when.
This piece allowed the semi-finalists to win their place in the final through various events.
In addition, the main salon of the house changes its appearance several times, at the theme parties.
The title of his secret was "I'm the biggest fan of Secret Story".
The House of Secrets has welcomed many guests during the season:
The hunt for secrets ends at the end of week 11.
The amounts indicated in this table correspond to the amounts of the pools at the end of the corresponding Weekly.
On August 19, two days before the launch, a potential candidate named Ali is unveiled.
In order to integrate the House of Secrets, he must be loved 50,000 times on Facebook.
It has been confirmed on the site myTF1 that if he integrates the adventure, he will have a secret related to that.
He got on the show's Facebook page between Aug. 19 and the launch bonus.
On August 21, fourteen candidates enter the house.
They are brothers and sister false-twins, so they will have to share the secret "We are twins.
In order to protect their secret, they will pretend to be ex.
The seven candidates enter and are summoned in the living room of this little house.
The Voice informs them that they will compete with the inhabitants of the big house.
Just arrived in the SAS, La Voix asked them to open the briefcase in front of them.
And that throughout the week they will have missions.
It is then announced that a few days ago, Coralie & Nicolas were subjected to an experiment.
This experience has designed their secret which is "We are the subject of an unprecedented love affair.
In the house they will have to pretend to be two strangers.
The Voice tells him that the first infiltration will soon take place, so a connection with the little house is made.
R√©mi who is the accomplice of this house will have to diversion so that the infiltration is not discovered.
Having trouble punching the cushions, she takes one and brings it into the small house.
Once inside, the inhabitants pierce the cushion and find the key inside.
To end this bonus, it is announced that a former candidate will return to the adventure.
On the bridge, we are shown a young brunette who is back.
Then, in her portrait, it is announced that this candidate is Vanessa of season 3.
She reveals to be less naive, less shy, and safer.
On August 22, La Voix announces to the big house candidates that they are immune to future appointments.
On the other hand, in order to keep this immunity, they will have to understand why they got it.
On August 26, Coralie spots Karisma and Ali during their infiltration.
As a result, La Voix calls them to the SAS and reminds them that they are entitled to only 2 failures.
It is announced later in the day that they will have a second chance, at night, while the inhabitants are sleeping.
It is the members of the small house who have obtained immunity.
Therefore, all the inhabitants of the big house are nominated.
At the end of the bonus of August 28, "Vanessa" is eliminated with 9% of the vote.
During the August 28 bonus, the last infiltration takes place.
The inhabitants of the little house open the locks of the bust one by one, then take this one.
Since this bust is the symbol of immunity, all the inhabitants of the little house are immune.
Therefore, all the inhabitants of the big house are nominated.
The Voice broadcasts a message that R√©mi wished to spend a few hours earlier.
In this one, the young man announces that he knows √âmilie outside the show and that he knows that she has a twin brother.
Therefore, La Voix offers him to be the guardian angel of the secret of √âmilie and Lo√Øc.
Thanks to that, the twins will be able to perfect their ex strategy by including Remi in it.
In order to blur the slopes, Remi will pretend to be √âmilie's boyfriend.
After, the inhabitants of the small house integrate the big house.
When she asks him if Nicolas understands the mission, he answers.
In order to help him in this mission, La Voix offers him a slate.
After that, it's Karisma's turn to be summoned to the confessional.
Indeed, a video message from his twin sister who lives in Nepal is shown.
The young woman lied, claiming she had never seen her sister.
The lie of Karisma forces La Voix to take "exceptional measures".
If the majority of them want Karisma to stay, the latter will stay.
On the same day, the Mister Secret elections also take place.
Jonathan is elected Mister Secret, while the first dolphin is Arthur.
no-valid-translation
On September 2nd, the girls went to the confessional in turn to nominate the 2 boys of their choice.
During the reward of September 4th, R√©mi is first summoned to the immersion room.
He thinks the locals do not know what he's saying, but in reality, Emilie listens to his answers to the confessional.
After answering Emilie all the questions, he returns to the show.
But for him to get his immunity, the voice tells him that she has 48 hours to break with him.
She accepts this mission because she begins to hold on to her fake boyfriend and would not want to see him leave the adventure.
Some images of his words, behind the backs of the inhabitants (including Alia, √âmilie and M√©lanie), are shown to him.
She accepts that these images are revealed: therefore, she is immune.
So that they are not given to the other inhabitants, the two men must accept the dilemmas given by the voice.
Lo√Øc's index is "ADN", while Nicolas's index is Coralie's eye.
Nicolas, meanwhile, accepts that a hint about Jonathan's secret is revealed.
The voice also announces that he will have an accomplice for this mission.
The name of it will be revealed to him later (it will be Arthur).
Alia and Manon are the two nominees of the week.
Claudia is elected Miss Secret 2015: the first runner up is M√©lanie and √âmilie, the second runner-up.
A challenge that Ali leads with brilliance and who still made the thread of the daily, Tuesday, September 15.
Their complicity was again noticed during the body-painting session organized by La Voix.
Already recovered by the events of the day before, Alia has logically boiled with envy.
As Kevin was nominated, they had to choose to nominate between Jonathan and Ali.
But having failed to decide, they nominated both.
Having found the right secret, he wins the totality of his kitty.
During the bonus of 18 September, "Kevin" is eliminated with 26.2% of the vote.
During the bonus of September 18, R√©mi is nominated because he unveiled a false clue about the secret of twins.
She is so disappointed with Ali because she had feelings for him.
Melanie was elected investigator of the week, so the Voice decided to give her a present.
Melanie has the right to meet her mom, but the Voice said "Freeze!
The voice had already given him the first two digits ("56").
But if not, they would both be the only nominees this week.
The other inhabitants therefore had the mission to deceive Nicolas by affirming each one in their turn that they were the mystery person.
On September 19th, "Claudia" decides to leave the adventure, the departure of Kevin being too heavy for her.
On September 21, Nicolas lost two clues and won one.
This is the letter "I" referring among others to Melanie.
John is on the trail of the Twin Secret "Emilie and Lo√Øc".
La Voix announces to the inhabitants that following the departure of Claudia the girls' nominations were canceled.
Coralie's immunity and R√©mi's appointment are postponed until next week.
The next few days and weeks can only tell us if the evacuation is going on peacefully or not.
On September 22, Nicolas found who had the other half of the code.
Karisma buzzed Lo√Øc, √âmilie and R√©mi with the title: "We are singers in a known group".
From that moment, all the other candidates (Ali, Alia, Arthur, Coralie, √âmilie, Jonathan, Karisma, Lo√Øc and R√©mi) are automatically nominated.
On September 25th, during the bonus, the small house reopens to welcome four mothers of inhabitants.
At the end of the vote, three candidates are tied with 3 votes against them and are nominated.
On September 30, during the daily, Jonathan buzz Lo√Øc and √âmilie with the title "" We are twin brothers "".
During the October 2 bonus, "Alia" is eliminated with 24% of the votes.
She has 24 hours to choose the two candidates she wants to put in danger before her final choice.
At the end of this bonus, following the public vote, √âmilie integrates the secret room.
The sixtieth week of the adventure will be placed under the sign of the war of the clans.
The jackpots of the inhabitants of each clan are then tied together.
In the house, the Voice imposes a first test to the clans: to create an identity.
The one whose identity will be judged most striking by the Voice will be the winner of this mission.
He can therefore get a clue about a candidate from the other team.
Together, the "Serial Buzzers" choose to discover a clue about Nicolas.
During the daily of Tuesday, Karisma and Melanie, the clan of the "Serial Buzzers" choose to nominate Nicolas.
This week, Nicolas and Ali are the two nominees.
They decide to discover a hint about Ali's secret, which Jonathan will find later.
At the end of the bonus of October 16, "Nicolas" is eliminated.
These newcomers are in fact former candidates of the previous seasons of "Secret Story".
Coralie is the first to execute and the Voice rewards her by offering her new immunity.
Their arrival will redistribute the cards within the house.
The next day, the red phone rings to bring a series of dilemmas to several residents.
The nominees of the week are Ali, Coralie, Karisma and Lo√Øc.
To keep Eddy, the inhabitants will have to unanimously agree to grant his requests.
Finally, Ali had the choice to go see Alia who was in the airlock or keep Nathalie in the house.
Finally, as a result of the decisions of the residents concerned, none of the three elders leave the house that evening.
At the end of the 23 October bonus, "Ali" is eliminated with 17.9% of the votes.
The candidates went one by one to the confessional to nominate a person of the opposite sex.
After a tie, the girls are ironed in the confessional for a second round.
Karisma and R√©mi are the two nominees of the week.
The rumor then spreads gradually throughout the house, disturbing Emily who thinks that her boyfriend would have cheated.
At the moment of this revelation, the Voice makes Melanie believe that she wins all the kittens of Coralie and R√©mi.
The young woman decides to make R√©mi believe that she wants to put an end to their relationship.
The percentages are not communicated because two weeks before the final, the production wants to keep the "suspense".
They will be found on the site of the show at the end of the season.
During the October 30 bonus, the House of Secrets becomes the manor of secrets.
While the inhabitants are disguising themselves, the lights go out and screams arise to scare the inhabitants.
Once all ready, Melanie is summoned to the hall of horror, a new piece on the occasion of the Halloween bonus.
After they finish, they bring back Lo√Øc, an entry that made a flop.
Then the Voice asks the latter to leave the house through the airlock.
Melanie is the first to be ousted from the race instead in the final
If no one buzze before 1 minute, the place in the final is definitely lost.
After twenty-four hours of reflection, "Coralie" decided to sacrifice herself by leaving the game.
He will have found four secrets in total, which is a record in the story of "Secret Story".
After the bonus of November 5, it is "Melanie" who is eliminated.
We will not see his face, just a touch pad with a moving eye.
During the semi-finals bonus, La Voix offers dilemmas in relation to their prize pool to the 6 semi-finalists.
Each candidate receiving one of his cards will have to give it to another inhabitant.
In the end bonus, the Voice makes the finalists believe that there are actually only two finalists.
These two finalists will be nominated by the last previously eliminated candidates namely Nicolas, Ali, Karisma, Coralie and Melanie.
The Voice makes the finalists believe that they have never left the house and have joined the Little House.
The deception remains in place until November 9, the day the Voice reveals it.
The finalists will then play their guests of the day, Coralie and Nicolas.
On November 10th, R√©mi was sent to make √âmilie believe that one of his ex was waiting for him when he left.
With the complicity of Lo√Øc, he will write a false letter in which his alleged ex Laura reveals his feelings.
The letter is unveiled during an enigma given by the Voice which is rewarded by letters from relatives.
This week, as every year, alumni are back to support the candidates:
The message was recorded just after evacuating the house and the studio where the bonus took place.
Indeed, never before a final was canceled a few minutes from the antenna.
Also note, a dozen policemen charged to make leave the studios of the plain of St-Denis.
This is the third highest percentage of a Secret Story winner.
His check is presented to him on Friday, November 20th with Christophe Beaugrand and the other 3 finalists.
This 45-minute sequel is aired in the evening, after the Debrief at around 19:50, since 10 September.
In Belgium, this program is broadcast later, after the broadcast of "Touche pas √† mon poste!
We can therefore say that the switchover of TF1's flagship program on this other channel is a success.
Finally, it should be recalled that the premiums of the lock-up program are broadcast in the second half of the evening.
In view of this disappointing record, Thierry Moreau announced in October in "Touche pas √† mon poste!"
In addition, Christophe Beaugrand also said he was going for a season 10.
If it is actually signed, this new season will probably be broadcast entirely on NT1.
According to Christophe Beaugrand, Secret Story 9 has totaled more than 180 million views on MYTF1.FR videos this year.
Note: The "Best-Of" of the week have been deprogrammed by NT1 as a result of catastrophic hearings.
The departmental library of Bas-Rhin (BDBR), departmental council department of Bas-Rhin, is a departmental library of loan (BDP).
This service ensures the public reading policy, compulsory competence of the department of Bas-Rhin.
And it provides real-time and on-demand transport services in remote areas.
BDBR has been led by Anne-Marie Bock since May 2, 2007.
Created in 1946, the establishment is a service of the county council of Bas-Rhin since 1986.
A mobile library service existed before and went through the towns and villages of Alsace.
This bus was open to the public who could find inside a number of books.
In 1988, the public reading competence was transferred from the state to the departments.
It is replaced today by several shuttles better adapted to the delivery of the reserved documents.
They are an important support and necessary to the good functioning of the service especially in the rural and / or isolated areas.
The seat of the BDBR was first the city of Strasbourg.
A move was made in 1999 to the city of Truchtersheim.
However, it will remain closed to the public since another library already exists in Truchtersheim: the intermedia media library Kochersberg (MIK).
The BDBR offers various services to the libraries of its network:
The BDBR establishes documentary collections within it and then values ‚Äã‚Äãthem in order to propose them to the libraries of its network.
In order to lend documents to other libraries and to the public, it has several logistical services:
In 2014, this service had about 200 animation supports that can take different forms.
These media are therefore offered to the network libraries to perform one-off animations with different audiences.
Since 2010, digital services are offered to the libraries of the departmental network which can then offer them to their users:
In translation of the local cultural policy of the County Council, the BDBR develops two types of actions on the territories:
The BDBR, like other BDPs, offers free training for all employees and volunteers in its network.
These trainings are divided into two main parts:
Covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã440 m2, this cultural establishment has a dual mission:
The Betschdorf relay is a territorial service of the departmental library of Bas-Rhin and depends on the county council.
Effective giving is an important element of effective altruism, as some charities are much more effective than others.
For example, randomized controlled trials conducted by J-PAL have demonstrated the effectiveness of mass deworming treatments.
Traditionally, charity assessments have favored the minimization of administrative costs in proportion to the income of the organization.
Successful altruists prefer to measure the results obtained per euro invested, regardless of the share of administrative costs.
Thus, administrative expenses can help direct resources to the best activities.
It is rare that the choice of the cause itself is critically analyzed.
They will then put their time and money into the actions and organizations that pursue these goals effectively.
Effective altruists reject the idea that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others.
Effective altruists argue that counterfactual reasoning is important in determining how to maximize their positive impact.
Thus, choosing a classic altruistic career can have a much smaller impact than it seems.
The win-to-give strategy is proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists.
According to Williams, consequentialism requires one to act in a way that violates our own integrity.
The cost to train a guide dog for the blind in the United States is $ 42,000.
This operation is safe and works in 80% of cases of trichiasis.
Thus, the view can be restored to 840 people for the cost of a guide dog.
A supererogatory act is one that is good, but not morally necessary.
These philosophers argue that abstaining from helping the poorest people is a moral fault.
Effective altruists do not necessarily reject the existence of supererogatory acts, but may negate the supererogatory nature of certain acts.
This argument assumes that physical distance does not affect the morality of an action, a key principle of effective altruism.
The principles of effective altruism can involve significant lifestyle changes.
For Heraclitus, change was the fundamental principle of life.
Many effective altruists try to live frugally against the norms of rich countries, in order to be able to give more.
Some effective altruists also pursue high-income careers to have more money to give, according to the win-for-give strategy.
Jason Trigg works as a quantitative analyst for a financial company and gives half of his salary.
It promises the ethical consciousness and you enter into global poverty and the existing risks to humanity.
He lives with ¬£ 18,000 (¬£ 24,000) a year and donates the rest of his income.
A number of organizations work in the field of effective altruism.
And that's fine, as long as everyone is aware of it. "
In 2015, the Boston Review published a debate between Peter Singer and twelve respondents on the topic of effective altruism.
For the most part, fossils consist of mineralized materials such as bones or shells.
Contrary to popular belief, soft tissue preservation is not so rare.
Contrary to popular belief, globalization is not a factor of homogenization and Americanization of world cultures.
The cuticle of plants is more prone to conservation if it contains cutane, rather than cutin.
Clay minerals can improve the preservation of organic matter, and different clay minerals leave different signatures.
Democratic education is an educational movement with democracy as both a goal and a teaching resource.
Democratic education is often particularly emancipatory, considering the voice of a student equal to that of a teacher.
Although it is associated with many individuals, no central figure, establishment or nation put it forward.
Emile or Education, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's treatise on education was published in 1762.
√âmile, the imaginary pupil used to illustrate his point, had to learn only what he was able to judge useful.
He had to appreciate his lessons and learn to rely on his own judgment and experience.
He tells us that this school was evolving freely based on principles introduced by teachers and students.
Despite the predominant influence of the teacher, the student always had the choice to come to school as he pleased.
Once present, he could choose not to listen to the teacher.
The oldest surviving democratic school is Summerhill, in Suffolk, England, founded in 1921.
All courses are optional, and the School Council holds important powers.
In the 1960s, hundreds of "free schools" opened in the United States, mostly inspired by Summerhill.
The Sudbury Valley School, founded in Framingham, Massachusetts in 1968, does not offer a prior educational program or optional activities.
The School Council manages all aspects of the school, including recruiting staff and purchasing equipment.
"Sudbury" is now considered a group of schools inspired by the original.
The Democratic School of Hadera, founded in Israel in 1987, is funded by the state.
There are now more than twenty democratic schools in Israel.
IDEC 2005 established two core principles: self-determination and democratic governance.
IDEN (International Network for Democratic Education) supports all schools that declare themselves democratic.
Democratic schools involve students in the decision-making process that affects what they learn and how.
They provide the necessary help for students to prepare for national exams.
The child-adult difference is thus erased to the end on this aspect.
Most also have a General Assembly also open to parents.
In some schools, attendance at these meetings is mandatory; in others, it is optional.
A School Council usually trains sub-councils to deal with particular problems, such as conflict resolution.
In the field of democratic values, there is a wide range of possibilities for dealing with conflicts.
There may be a formal system, with rules of procedure and a process of sanctioning transgressions.
There may be rules, but no punishments if they are transgressed.
Other possibilities include consensus, mediation or informal dialogue.
Some schools may have tuition fees that adjust to family income.
Size: The size of democratic schools varies from a few students to several hundred.
Even an individual unschooler can be considered a "democratic learner" if he is treated in accordance with democratic values.
Extent of ages: multi-age is usually a deliberate policy of democratic schools.
Location: democratic education is not limited to a particular environment.
The context for democratic learning can be in an office, the streets of a city, and the countryside.
There are as many types of democratic education as there are types of democracies, which makes democratic education difficult to define.
A general definition could be "an education that democratizes learning itself."
The goals of democratic education vary by participant, context, and access to resources.
There is no unified body of texts on democratic education.
However, there are democratic theories of education from the following perspectives:
During the movement of the theory of intelligence, there was a renewed interest in the development of the child.
Jean Piaget's modeling of periods of individual evolution have been challenged by democratic schools.
"There are no two children going the same way.
For Lave, learning is a process carried out by an actor in a specific context.
His study focused on mathematics in context and mathematics education.
This makes adolescents easily influenced by their environment and more prone to impulsive behavior.
It is unthinkable that children released in an environment without structure and planning could free them from this.
The type of political socialization that takes place in democratic schools is strongly related to the theory of deliberative democracy.
In other words, what is learned is a subject on which one must agree within the learning process itself. "
As a result, civic education taught in a context of compulsory education undermines one's own lessons in democracy.
This argument joins Lave's research on situational learning.
These features include the growing importance of collaboration, decentralized organization, and creativity.
Democratic schools do not just consider reading, writing and arithmetic as the fundamentals for becoming an accomplished adult.
Any attempt to limit, control or direct games must be democratically approved before being put in place.
The game is considered as valuable as academic subjects, and even more.
Play is considered essential for learning, especially to stimulate creativity.
Progressive educators allow children to choose their readings, as well as the topics they write about.
In addition, experts in democratic education, including Stephen Krashen, emphasize the role of libraries in promoting democratic education.
In the industrial age John Dewey argued that the same program should not be given to all children.
In Democracy and Education, he develops a philosophy of education based on democracy.
Deliberative democracy is the best way to agree on these roles.
Democracy, he said, is the best way to replace our leaders without bloodshed.
By "democratic education" they mean "educating the youth ... for active participation in a democratic society."
Teaching placements are practiced in conventional schools and democratic schools.
Summerhill was represented by a recognized human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC.
Lawyers, human rights defenders and political leaders have since been arrested.
The government quickly failed, and an amicable agreement was proposed.
The agreement ensures that future Summerhill inspections would be consistent with Summerhill's educational philosophy.
The local government encourages and organizes the attacks of the Arab inhabitants against the Jewish population.

The fish used is not chosen for its quality and freshness, monosodium glutamate (MSG) is added for the taste.
White dumplings are larger and contain only fish without any other ingredients.
They are simply boiled, which gives them their white color.
The fish used are chosen for their quality and taste.

Antoine Triller, born May 23, 1952, is director of research at Inserm.
Antoine Triller has a medical training at the University Hospital of La Piti√© Salpetri√®re (1978).
In 1979, he was recruited as a research associate at Inserm.
In 2010, he created the Institute of Biology of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of which he is the director.
This Institute results from the regrouping of all Biology within the Department.
He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 2011.
This foundation promotes interactions between biology, chemistry and physics.
The physical-chemistry-biology sequence assumes that ongoing college professional development for faculty is essential.
His career as a synapse specialist focused on the development of technological approaches in partnership with physicists.
These approaches enabled him to characterize some structural parameters of quantum release.
This work has served as a model for locating most of the channels and receptors, such as glutamate receptors.
Antoine Triller has demonstrated the possibility of co-transmission involving two conventional transmitters, glycine and GABA.
He showed that the nature of the pre-synaptic neurotransmitter determines the type of receptor accumulating in postsynaptic density.
This technological advance has made it possible to move from static imaging of molecules to a dynamic approach with very high resolution.
Triller has participated in numerous publications and has written the following works:
Officially, it is an "anti-fascist wall of protection" to safeguard the "freedom" of the citizens of the German Democratic Republic.

The Lure country, in the center-west, is characterized by a deposit of Quaternary alluvium exploited for its aggregates.
There are several waterfalls like the Ognon jump (which is an artificial fall).
The hydraulic energy supplied by these rivers was used by various activities (mills, sawmills, glassworks, forges, factories and mines).
The winds can be sustained, mainly from the west, cool and humid, and secondarily from the east or north-east: the bise.

About forty glassmakers from the Vosges and the Rhone Valley settle in Franche-Comt√©, especially in the Vosges sa√¥noises.
Miellin has the first glassworks in 1637, another workshop is built a century later.
A glassworks is opened in 1700 by the Gr√©zely family in Malbouhans.
It closes in 1890, having not invested in glass mills.
A second glassworks is created in 1780 by Celestin Grezely at a place called La Saulnaire, whose production is sold in Paris.
During the Second World War, several maquis settle in forests, hills and mountains, including the maquis of Cherimont.
The progression is fast except in Champagney where the situation stagnates during 55 days.
In September 1944, a thousand maquisards take refuge in the forest of the Planche des Belles Filles.
The region is the country of the Vosges S√¥noises, a grouping structure of local communities that has a SCOT.
Its communes are members of the Regional Natural Park of Ballons des Vosges (mixed syndicate).
As in the rest of the department, the activity is mainly oriented towards industry, agriculture and forestry.
The Luxeuil-Saint Sauveur Air Base 116 is the second largest employer in terms of the department's workforce.
The two main elements of the natural heritage are the Vosges Massif and the Thousand Ponds region.
The region of the Vosges sa√¥noises is the seat of several museums and ecomuseums.
The Marcel-Maulini mine museum deals with the history of Ronchamp collieries and Polish immigration in the local mining area.
The departmental museum of the mountain presents a typical set of houses recreated in a park in Ch√¢teau-Lambert.

A political debate emerges on the relationship between the location, ownership and control of these resources.
The analysis and political debates on race relations are considerably behind in Europe.
The natural resource base used for renewable energies is extraordinary for Europe.
Scotland surpassed its renewable energy target, in 2007 31% of energy production came from renewable sources.
In 2011, the target set for 2020 went from 50% to 100% renewable energy generation.
In 2012, more than 40% of Scotland's electricity was produced by renewable energies.
Scotland has contributed almost 40% of UK renewable energy production.
Most of the power generation comes from gas and oil.
The 2002 figures used in the RSPB Scotland "et al."
Keep in mind that electricity generation is only part of the overall energy use budget.
In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms.
Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are the key centers for the development of offshore wind energy and wave energy.
The tidal power industries are centered around mountainous regions and islands.
Rural employment creation is driven by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray, Dumfries and Galloway.
Job creation remains feverish, and this job continues to dissociate itself from growth.
Nevertheless, the Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for the production of renewable energy.
In 2015, about 80% of the village area was covered by forests.
The village of Yamazoe is essentially an agricultural commune that produces vegetables, fruits (apples, pears, blueberries, strawberries) and rice.

At the time, space missions were carried out in difficult physical conditions, requiring a very good physical condition.
The astronauts of the time were therefore in full strength.
These two parameters, duration of the trip and youth of the crew, made the treatment of the sexual aspect of the mission a priority.
On the other hand, the comfort of spacecraft, the assistance robots, make the physical abilities of astronauts much less necessary.
The radiation levels that astronauts will receive during their mission have been significantly re-evaluated.
Their dangerousness in the very long term also including the reproductive function.
It is now envisaged to offer Martian missions to older astronauts who have already founded their families.
There are no reliable sources proving that this type of act has already occurred.
In 2007, "The Guardian" ultimately denies this information because the NASA rating is false.

The report also concludes with the need to provide the new state with an intelligence agency.
He stressed the importance of having an operational tax administration as soon as possible.

The EF engine series is a three-cylinder, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, SOHC.
The EF appeared while the EK was replaced by the EN05.
The EA engine was used from 1966 until 1994, in most models.

The fifth digit is the only way to say what the engine is without seeing it.
Generally the EJ series can be divided into two versions: Phase I engines (1989-1998) and Phase II engines (1999-2010).
The designation has also changed from Phase I to Phase II.
Phase I: EJ15E, EJ15J, EJ16E, EJ18E, EJ20D, EJ20E, EJ20G, EJ20H, EJ20J, EJ20R, EJ20K, EJ22E, EJ221, EJ25D
Phase II: EJ151, EJ161, EJ181, EJ201, EJ202, EJ203, EJ204, EJ205, EJ206, EJ207, EJ208, EJ222, EJ251, EJ252, EJ253, EJ254, EJ255, EJ257
